<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is traditional, we’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"><span class="s2"><b>Flat Track Stats</b></span></a> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <strong><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). Our new SRD Rank for April is coming soon – the third for this year, with this years' redesigned interface, allowing you to browse historical rankings for the last 10 years, view a map of all the active teams, select by country, gender, and get predictions of scores. (It also has some WFTDA rankings as well as SRDRank.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is traditional, we’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"><span class="s2"><b>Flat Track Stats</b></span></a> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <strong><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). Our new SRD Rank is out – the second for this year, with an entirely redesigned interface, allowing you to browse historical rankings for the last 10 years, view a map of all the active teams, select by country, gender, and get predictions of scores. (It also has some WFTDA rankings as well as SRDRank.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]</span></p>

For some, their purpose is to advance as far as their body will allow. For others, it’s a great way to get out a couple of nights per week and let off some steam in a fun, friendly environment.</span></p>
<p>Mean City Roller Derby fall somewhere in the middle, as we're made up of a wide variety of different people and personalities – we have actors, students, scientists and even a Thai masseur! It's our members that make our league special. Although we have lives outside of derby, we'll always be there for each other, both on and off the track.</p>
<p>This year we're looking to continue to build upon progress we've made as a league and as a group of friends. Next Saturday<strong>, 20th May 2017</strong>, will be our first bout of the year and we are hoping to capitalise on the hard work we've put into our training. Not only that, we are rebranding and will be debuting our new logo and team tops for the first time!</p>
<p>The logo really captures the good humour of the league and the spirit of Glasgow, Mean City's home and stomping ground.  We don't want to give too much away until game day, but we can say the logo is indeed still purple! This has been a long time in the making, but we can proudly say it looks fantastic. A big thank you to our Design Team and to Roller Derby City for our awesome new uniforms.</p>
<p>We are facing tough opposition. Our ladies' team are playing the Granite City Fight Hawks from Aberdeen. We played them up north in <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/85548"><strong>October 2016</strong></a> and were narrowly defeated, so we will be looking to make the most of the home advantage! Our co-ed/open team will then be playing the Portsmouth Scurvy Wenches who are travelling up to Glasgow for the bout. They are more unknown to us, so should make exciting opponents. We also hear they like a good after party, as do we!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19259" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/05/received_10158754874915594.jpeg?w=300" alt="received_10158754874915594" width="300" height="300"></p>

<p>As part of our short series on Coaches and Coaching initiatives in the UK (which started with a look at the Derby Form Check initiative), it would be remiss of us not to cover this next topic:</p>
<p><img class=" size-medium wp-image-19248 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/05/rule56.jpg?w=600" alt="Rule56" width="300" height="300"> Logo by Lee Moyer Designs</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rulefiftysix.com/"><strong>Rule 56</strong></a>, the North-of-England based coaching business responsible for the UK's first Coaching Summit last year, have not been resting on their laurels.</p>
<p>Continuing their association with Texas Rollergirls' Smarty Pants, (also of <a href="http://www.getsmartycoaching.com/"><strong>Get Smarty Coaching</strong></a>) Rule 56 have been spreading communication via their series of Coaching Webinars.</p>
<p>Hosted on <a href="https://rule56.clickmeeting.com/"><strong>ClickMeeting</strong></a>, the Webinars make use of videoconferencing technology to allow coaches and skaters from around the world to attend a virtual seminar-like experience - with the advantage that collaboration is enhanced by shared whiteboards and the like.</p>
<p>SRD attended two of these hour-long sessions, where Smarty took the attendees (representing leagues from Illinois through Spain, and within the UK from Southhampton all the way up to Orkney) through an engaging look at a particular topic. In our cases, these were the "general purpose" introductory Coaching sessions - called Coaching 101 and 201 on the model of American University course numbering - which covered concepts such as "how to coach adults", "different styles of interaction when coaching", and so on.</p>
<p>The participants were all engaged regularly by Smarty - and the advantage of the online format was that Smarty could always look back at the chat stream at a later moment, without breaking her flow, to pick up responses and questions. This was definitely handled well as a component of the seminar - whilst Smarty stuck to her slides generally, the responses from the attendees were woven into variation and extension on each topic as it was addressed.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19251" src="2017/05/screen-shot-2017-05-01-at-19-45-51-a.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-05-01 at 19.45.51-a" width="3080" height="1750"></p>
<p>Explicitly collaborative "brainstorming" sessions were also well managed, with the shared whiteboard eliciting some genuinely free discussion, as you can see below:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19252" src="2017/05/screen-shot-2017-05-01-at-20-23-43-a.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-05-01 at 20.23.43-a" width="3070" height="1746"></p>
<p>We spoke to Steph Howarth, of Tiger Bay Brawlers, who also participated in both sessions, who was equally positive. "Although I've been playing roller derby for a while, I'm relatively new to coaching. So it was great to have the chance to learn from Smarty's experience - she's clearly cares passionately about good coaching. I was particularly interested in learning how to structure practices and communicate my ideas better. Smarty's seminars really helped with this - I came away with a heap of new ideas."</p>
<p>The remaining sessions are still available to book from the Rule 56 Facebook Events page: <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/rule56/events/">https://www.facebook.com/pg/rule56/events/</a> , </strong>or the ClickMeeting link earlier in the article.</p>
<p>The next session will be on "Indicators in Coaching", on the 5th June - there's still time to book this! After that, the 12th sees a session titled "Creating Team Success", and the 19th a seminar on dealing with "Questions at Practice".</p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p>Other initiatives on the way from Rule 56, apart from actually coaching people, include a series of bootcamps - starting with one at the most northerly league in the UK, Orkney ViQueens! This is going to be an exciting one to attend, as Team England (and Rainy City)'s Missy Rascal is making her way up to lead the event as well.</p>
<p>You can catch up with Rule 56 at their coaching venue in Manningham Sports Centre in Bradford, online at their webinar series, or meet Hydra (#56 herself) at <a href="http://www.euroderbycon.com/"><strong>Euro Derby Con</strong></a> in mid-July, Barcelona!</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is traditional, we’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"><span class="s2"><b>Flat Track Stats</b></span></a> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <strong><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). Our new SRD Rank is out – the second for this year, with an entirely redesigned interface, allowing you to browse historical rankings for the last 10 years, view a map of all the active teams, select by country, gender, and get predictions of scores. (It also has some WFTDA rankings as well as SRDRank.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]</span></p>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Next in our series of articles covering new teams in the 2018 <strong><a href="http://www.rollerderbyworldcup.com/">Roller Derby World Cup</a></strong> is one of the smallest attendees. Representing Eastern Europe along with Team Russia, it's Team Romania!</span>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20282" src="2017/05/romania.jpg" alt="Romania" width="800" height="800"> Team Romania Logo: by Libby Odai and <span class="">Alina Usurelu</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">As with much of Eastern Europe, the spread of Roller Derby in Romania has been very slow: in fact, there are currently no leagues in the country, even in the capital Bucharest. Team Romania, then, is necessarily formed from expats and descendants of citizens - with the intent to promote the sport in the country itself as a result.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Exe QT, one of Team Romania's founders, is perhaps typical. "I've lived in Sweden since I was 4, so I'm pretty much Swedish," she told us, "even though I go back to Romania once every couple of years and obviously still speak Romanian with my mum, relatives etc..."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A skater for Gothenburg Roller Derby, Exe QT first thought of the possibility of Romanian entry for the World Cup because of a chance meeting at a London Rollergirls bootcamp. London Brawling's AnDrac is herself of Romanian ancestry, and meeting someone so well known in the sport set a "seed" in her brain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">All it took for it to sprout was hearing that there were other eligible skaters... and it started to look very possible indeed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Despite there not being any skaters in Romania itself, the team takes the representation of their country seriously. "I believe it's a huge thing to get to represent your nation, in any situation," says Exe QT. "I am proud of my heritage, even though in my daily life, no-one would think about that I'm basically a first generation 'immigrant'." </span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">And this patriotism is something echoed by fellow Team Romania member Tenacious (of Kent Roller Girls), for whom representation is really important: “to</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> represent Romania, myself, a woman, to the world it's fantastic! We have always had great females taking part in many different sports, females that I have always looked up to with a lot of respect and admiration. I would like to show that Team Romania can be diverse and supportive of all genders of people!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">AnDrac, who has joined the Team Romania roster herself, told us, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">"I am finally starting to feel quite excited about a potential Team Romania in the next World Cup as there is no roller derby in Romania yet. Hopefully we will be able to find a few more players to field a team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It will be an experience for all of us as we won't really have the time to train together like the more established teams but we would have paved the path for the future Romanians that play or will play Roller Derby around the world. Exciting times ahead!"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">As with many of the newer teams, the aim for Team Romania this time around is simply to represent. Exe QT notes, "For the Cup, I'm hoping that we could all go there and have fun! No-one should be upset if we lose games, and we could all celebrate being able to skate for our birth nation, enjoying the ambience, meeting new friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If we would win a few games that would be awesome.  But I don't want to put too much pressure on everyone, because we will be a team that barely would have practiced together, and that is a big disadvantage!"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And in the future, maybe Roller Derby will come to Bucharest itself! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Exe QT: "It would be great if we could find some people in Romania who'd be interested in starting up a team, but as we both know, it requires not only a lot of time and energy, but also money. Where should they practice, how do they get equipment etc etc</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I'd love to go there for a week and coach derby, like a full week's program on and off skates, so that they could start up (I coach my league, and I really love it)"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Even for the National Team itself, experienced skaters from Romania are welcome, as Tenacious notes, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">“I know Romanians are big on skating, inline especially. We can find a way of getting a team together, coaching them, even from the distance, if there's anyone interested in putting themselves forward!”</span>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Team Romania are still recruiting for players, and looking for coaches and support staff of all kinds, so if you would like to skate with them, apply at their Facebook page here: </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/RollerDerbyTeamRomania/"><b>https://www.facebook.com/RollerDerbyTeamRomania/</b></a>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is traditional, we’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"><span class="s2"><b>Flat Track Stats</b></span></a> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <strong><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). Our new SRD Rank is out – the second for this year, with an entirely redesigned interface, allowing you to browse historical rankings for the last 10 years, view a map of all the active teams, select by country, gender, and get predictions of scores. (It also has some WFTDA rankings as well as SRDRank.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]</span></p>

Unfortunately for BCR's Skelpies, they have picked up a few more injuries at their first game. This has left them with an even smaller roster than they had in Dublin; due to this they have decided to forfeit their game with GMRD, awarding GMRD the win.
<p>However, BCR will be drafting in a few guests to fill in the gaps in their squad thus allowing a game to be played and the event to remain a double header. The game will not count towards Champs, of course, but will still be great derby!</p>
<p>Teeside vs Men Behaving Derby will be a great fight. Teeside will be looking to to get their first points on the board, whilst Men Behaving Derby will be looking to take another win to consolidate their place at the top of the table.</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">One of the hot topics in Roller Derby, always, is Coaching. In recent times, since the Derby Stance Coaching Summit, we've seen even more collaboration and discussion in the area of UK Coaching - with <strong><a href="http://www.rulefiftysix.com">Rule56</a></strong>'s Coaching Webinars a direct follow on from this. However, there's initiatives happening even in the furthest reaches of the UK's geography... as our guest writer, and founder of <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/403911146657994/">Derby Form Check</a></strong>, Ronie Walters (of <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/OrkneyViqueens/">Orkney ViQueens</a></strong>) explains:</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-18605" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/05/derbyformcheck.jpg?w=300" alt="DerbyFormCheck" width="300" height="210"><p>One of the great things about roller derby is the grassroots ethos. We all know the ethos: "by the skaters for the skaters". You don’t need to jump through a lot of hoops and regulations to set up a roller derby league, you can just have the idea and get going.</p>
<p>This is exactly what we did in Orkney. Orkney is a small group of islands, off the North coast of Scotland. To get to us you need to get either a plane or a ferry. Obviously travelling to train with a local league is not really an option in this situation, so when we wanted to get started, we had to start from scratch.</p>
<p>The Roller Derby Community is lovely. Everyone is really supportive and I’ve made some great contacts whom I consider friends I’ve just not met yet, which has been awesome. But... it kind of feels like everyone is re-inventing the wheel.
Every single league I’ve encountered is using the WFTDA min-skills in some form as their standard for knowing when a skater is safe to play.
Every single league runs some form of “fresh meat” training program to get their skaters through those min skills.
Yet trying to find a training program to use as a template has been almost impossible.</p>
<p>We went to join the UKRDA to use that as a resource, yet, at present, you have to have been skating for 6 months as a team to be eligible to join – leaving you alone to muddle through until that point.</p>
<p>We were lucky enough to manage to get a couple of people to do the BRSF [British Roller Sports Federation] level 2 coaching course recently in Luton (from what I can gather, it’s not been run for a while) so that was amazing for us, and we learnt a lot from it in terms of coaching cues and coaching skills. We also attended the Rule 56 online coaching pilot, and are excited for the next sessions coming up.</p>
<p>Rule 56, like us, are looking for more joined up approaches to Roller Derby Coaching. They also believe we have some incredibly awesome coaches and skaters amongst us, we just need a more effective way to share them. The more we can share resources and skills, the faster we can progress as a sport, and the better the experience for those coming into the sport as new skaters.</p>
<p>It would be nice if, one day, new leagues starting in the UK could simply go to one place, and find all the information they needed.
This could be something as simple as UKRDA offering an associate membership so leagues can have access to the resources they need for that six month waiting period. This could then offer things like policies and constitutions, a clearly laid out min skills program, information on how to test a min skill and tell if your skater has mastered it, a resource for learning how to coach effectively, and access to a library of videos of real skaters complete with feedback on where they can improve, as well as video of ideal form to know what you are looking to get your skaters to.
The latter part of this has taken a step forward recently, with the introduction of <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoWo7DaL7OZGmG6gijWd7SQ">WFTDA Ed</a></strong> min skills videos. For the first time, there is some standardised indication of what a skill should look like.</p>
<p>However, how do you get from where you are now, to that perfect form? Something I read recently in PEAK, when it was being discussed in the roller derby book club, was the notion of deliberate practice. Peak posits that there is no such thing as people with innate talent or ability. Even the likes of Beethoven or Tiger Woods are great because they have put in a lot of practice.
But this is not just about spending time; it’s about deliberate practice. Taking a skill and breaking it down into its elements, then practicing the elements making use of effective feedback to help you master the different parts.</p>
<p>As a new club, we are learning together. We have some skilled skaters, but no-one with roller derby experience, or with experience in how to observe a skater and break the skill down for them with feedback to allow them to practice the elements and build it back up. It occurred to me that if we as a wider roller derby community could share video footage of us skating, we could all benefit from the feedback experienced skaters could provide. We are all individual, and we all learn differently. Sometimes the way someone explains something just clicks for you and, all of a sudden, you master that tricky bit you have been stuck on for a while.</p>
<p><em>Roller Derby Form Check</em> aims to provide this opportunity. As a new Facebook group, it only has a few videos at present, but with over 370 members, it has the potential to be a very powerful resource. The hope is that gradually people will start to post a video of themselves doing a skill they are struggling with. So rather than a written post of how you're struggling with your 27/5 or you just can’t get transitions but don’t know why, you can film yourself. You will then get personalised feedback, rather than generic answers, or written descriptions which can be hard to visualise.</p>
<p>Our dream for the group is that over time we build a library of people demonstrating common issues with the minimum skills, with a whole range of ways of explaining how they can work to improve from different people.
Some of those explanations will hopefully also come with a video of them demonstrating the techniques they are suggesting. Using this, coupled with the “perfect” examples from WFTDA Ed, will really allow for some really powerful coaching resources to develop. We can already see that coaches are finding it helpful to learn additional ways to explain things and break skills down.</p>
<p>So if you are stuck on a skill you just can’t seem to master, no matter how often your coach explains it, post a video. Maybe someone else’s tips will help you. If you are a coach and you have one skater that you just can’t figure out how to help, ask them if they are OK with posting a video and see if other people’s explanations can help them break through.</p>
