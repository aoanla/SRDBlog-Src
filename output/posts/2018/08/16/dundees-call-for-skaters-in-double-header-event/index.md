We look forward to the challenge, the team building and most importantly, skating on track with the Bonnie Colliders."<strong> - Megatron</strong> (<em>Mean City)</em></blockquote>
<blockquote>"The Colliders are buzzed to be playing on their home turf! We have a strong team and have outlined strong focuses for each skater.
