<p>As well as the exciting home games in Scotland this weekend, there's also an equally exciting away game, as Aberdeen's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GraniteCityRollerDerby/"><strong>Granite City Roller Derby</strong></a> send their B team off to Portugal to play in the <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/596021074083791/">Quad Cup 2018!</a></strong></p>
<p>This is the second iteration of the Quad Cup, the 2017 version seeing hosts, Coimbra's Rocket Dolls Roller Derby, play Black Thunders Roller Derby of Madrid, Lyon Roller Derby B team, Gones'n'Roses, and the exhibition team Liberty Rebellion in a 2 day round robin.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26858" src="../../../../../2018/06/quadcup2018.jpg" alt="QuadCup2018" width="2048" height="1071"></p>
<p>This 2018 iteration of the European tournament pits the Fight Hawks against the returning teams of the hosts, and Black Thunders Roller Derby in a round-robin format in one day.</p>
<p>These will be the first games for the Fight Hawks this year, after their final bout in 2017, an extremely closely fought <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/node/98576"><strong>2 point win</strong></a> against York Minxters!</p>
<p>Their opponents, meanwhile, have had one or two bouts already this year: Black Thunders playing Las Palmas to an overwhelming win early in the year; and both teams having faced As Brigantias (A Coruña, hosts of the upcoming WFTDA Playoffs in August). Whilst neither team defeated A Coruña's finest, the Black Thunders did considerably better than Coimbra, with a mere 34 point loss on an overall low-scoring game. As the Madrid team also defeated all comers in the 2017 Quad Cup, they must be the favourites this time around as well.</p>
<p>Flat Track Stats agrees, with their European rating (at the time of publication), giving Black Thunders a 91% chance of victory over the hosts, and a 95% chance of victory over the Fight Hawks, who come in as the underdogs.</p>
<p>Of these, however, the Fight Hawks are also the clear wildcards - with few close connections between their rating games and those of the two Iberian teams, they have the highest uncertainty in their performance; and their "rating momentum" was upward for the entirety of last year. With even FTS's pessimistic prediction giving Granite City B an expected 21:25 score ratio against the hosts (translating to perhaps a 20 to 30 point final score difference), it seems very possible for Aberdeen to provide the upsets this weekend. Given the disruptive behaviour of their namesakes, what would be more appropriate?</p>
