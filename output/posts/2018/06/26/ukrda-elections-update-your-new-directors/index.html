<p>As a democratic organisation, the <strong><a href="https://ukrda.org.uk/">UK Roller Derby Association</a></strong> undergoes a yearly AGM, in which vacancies for its Directorships can be filled by vote within the member leagues. The most recent AGM was held this month, 5th of June, and resulted in a particularly large number of changes to the Directorships, due to retirements and the filling of previously empty posts.</p>
<p>We're giving you a quick overview of the current Directorships and their holders, to help you get to know your organisation.
