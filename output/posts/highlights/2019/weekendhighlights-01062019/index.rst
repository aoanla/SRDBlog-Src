There are far too many valuable fixtures to cover all of them (especially in France and the UK, which tend to
have multiple tournaments, bootcamps etc all on one weekend), but we also don't want to be so strict as to have
just 1 per country. So, we'll be doing the following:

Two highlights a weekend - Sat + (All Weekend); and then a smaller one for Sunday.

Both highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

This weekend is particularly rich in short-format events, with Sur5al, Roller Derby Sevens, and Short Track Roller Derby all happening around the world! There's also a world premiere of the new Street Roller Derby ruleset (in Germany), which is another attempt at producing a simpler, easier-to-officiate version of the game.

In the UK, the *Scottish Clause* means we're covering 3 different events, as our leagues are all off down south to play derby this weekend!

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`Hard Breaking Dolls`_ continue the trend in Poland for hosting short-format tournaments with an 8 team `Roller Derby Sevens`_ tournament.
10 games are packed into one day (meaning that this is probably an elimination tournament, with some consolation bouts), with competitors from across Poland and Central and Eastern Europe!

`H.O.S.S.A.`_ (Link to Facebook, sadly), the Northern Germany and Netherlands Men's derby collective, host the world's first demonstration of the `Street Roller Derby`_ ruleset. Street Roller Derby is yet another ruleset designed to make Roller Derby easier and more convenient to play, with less officiating load, and a simplified ruleset. (In the case of Street Roller Derby: officiating is managed by skaters not currently playing; there's no "Lead Jammer" powers; scoring, like in Short Track is 1 point per pass, not per skater passed; there's also no set duration; a reduced penalty list; and harsher penalty rules (a penalty has you sit out the rest of the jam!) ).

Unfortunately, this ruleset is currently only really being promoted on Facebook. We hope that it will become more accessible to non-Facebook users in future.

The Black Tagada, Zombeers and Dead Dragibus, the three aspects of `Roller Derby Calais`_, collectively host a day of short-format roller derby, with the return (for the 5th time) of their `Hit My Valentine`_ Sur5al tournament.
We say "Sur5al tournament", but really this is a whole weekend of Roller Derby surrounding the tournament: both days open with Open Scrimmage with special rules ("reverse derby direction" on Saturday, ), and the Saturday ends with a Junior Derby scrimmage as well.

`Arcadia Roller Derby`_ host the fourth of the British Champs Tier 2 North (WFTDA-side) fixtures this year. The hosts, currently second-from-bottom on the leaderboard, face Hallam Hellcats, just one space above them, in a battle for safety from the relegation zone. Meanwhile, Aberdeen's Granite City, currently in that relegation zone, face the imposing Hulls Angels, currently in 2nd place!

`Liverpool Roller Birds`_ host the 4th fixture of the British Championships Tier 1 North (WFTDA-side) this season. The hosts currently top the leaderboard for this tier, with an unbroken win record, and it seems likely that this will continue, as they face relegation-zone placed Sheffield Steel. We expect a much closer game between Manchester B and Auld Reekie B; currently near-tied (even with score difference) for 2nd and 3rd place in the board!

`Brewcity Bruisers`_ host the 10th edition of their annual invitational, the Midwest BrewHaHa! This is a multi-tier tournament with both MRDA-Sanctioned and WFTDA-Sanctioned bouts, as well as an unsanctioned B-tier for WFTDA leagues. With a huge number of participants, this is simply a tournament for WFTDA ranking, without a structure in itself.

This invitational is of interest to us due to European participation in both the WFTDA-Sanctioned and MRDA-Sanctioned tiers, with France's `Lomme Roller Girls`_, and Belgium's `Manneken Beasts`_ playing.

`Arizona Roller Derby`_ hosts the return of their Monsoon Madness invitiational, with two simultaneous tournaments - one A team, and one B team. The A team tier is, of course, WFTDA Sanctioned.
This is of interest to us due to the attendence of Buenos Aires' *`2x4 Roller Derby`_* in both tiers - Team OSOM in A, and Lxs Pibxs in B. As with Finvitational, this is *almost* a round-robin for both tiers!

`Angel City Derby`_ host a Mayday Brawl-B-Q, a two-day tournament with a little less scale than the other USA invitationals above. What makes this one special is the inclusion of a Juniors bout, and the attendance of `Baja Roller Derby`_ from Mexico. (Once again, the WFTDA part of the tournament is *almost* a round-robin, missing just Misery Loves Company versus SoCal).
