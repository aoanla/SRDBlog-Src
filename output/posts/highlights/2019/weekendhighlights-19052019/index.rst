This is the Sunday edition of this weekend's highlights, with just a few entries. As always the hardest picks are France and the UK, who tend to have
so many high quality events on at once that picking just one is almost impossible.

We're sticking to our limit of 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc.

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`Manneken Beasts`_ are on a coaching tour (we're a little concerned by their obvious love for late 1990s dance, given they're calling it "The VengaBeast on Tour"), and we're calling out this Italian part of it to represent both parts.

This is an Open To All genders bootcamp at intermediate level, coached by Track Vader (blocking), Trick or Threat (jamming), Goofy (jamming).

All profits from the coaching tour support Manneken Beasts even larger plans for a competitive tour of the USA, which you can also support on `GoFundMe`__.
