This weekend's highlights are back to our 1 update format as this is a little quieter. There's a bunch of exciting "summer" events on, though, which we should highlight up here: in the UK, Eastbourne Extreme takes derby outside and to the coast for a 2 day mixed tournament; in France, Saint-Gratien once again hosts the pan-France Tournament of 6 Regions; and in Bundaberg, Australia, the 2019 SKATE of Emergency continues to raise funds for emergency services.

(We'd also like to highlight the next "Un sol para lxs oficialxs", raising travel funds for Argentinian officials to support Roller Derby across the country; and on a different note ALL-IN's Short Track Experiment event in Leeds, exploring the new ruleset and how it might help to sustain & develop the sport.)

*This article amended on Tuesday for two late announced fixtures in Spain and Mexico.*

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`Roller Derby Panthers`_ host the 2019 edition of one of our favourite themed French tournaments: Le Tournoi des 6 Régions. This year, the regions of France are represented by
teams named as puns on the names of various french cheeses, or cheese-based-foods. We've tried to list the team names with a direct translation, and then what we *think* are the cheese being punned on in [ ], but our French is not perfect, so we're probably wrong for some of these.

`ALL IN - Community Roller Derby`_ hosts a half-day of exploration of the new Short Track Roller Derby ruleset from `Rolla Skate Club`_ , hosted by Hydra. As well as looking at, and playing, the full Short Track rules, Hydra will be introducing low-contact rules options, for allowing non-mins-passed, but low-contact-ready skaters to play. This is intended to be a low-pressure experience, and part of the interest is to provide new ways for people to enable more derby, for more people.

The Argentinian Officiating community host another edition of "Un sol para lxs oficialxs": the irregular series of fundraisers to support travel for Argentine officials. This edition supports officiating at Gatorneo 2019 in Mendoza; the distribution of Roller Derby in Argentina
being what it is, most official will be travelling across the width of the country to support that tournament, so all funds are important! (For perspective, it is almost 1000 km from Buenos Aires to Mendoza, in a straight line... Argentina is big.)
Un sol para lxs Oficialxs, as always, works as a weekend of roller derby, full of open-subscription games (in this case, 5 over the weekend) - all funds go towards officiating travel.

- MRDA-gender-policy mixed-teams
- WFTDA-gender-policy "C-level" mixed teams scrimmage.
- "Triangular" round-robin for 3 "B-level" mixed teams.

Event starts: 1000 Saturday
