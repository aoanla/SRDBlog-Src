This is the Sunday addendum for this week's highlights; and it's a busy Sunday (some two-day events are already covered in the Saturday highlights, and there are still triple headers here!). Sunday also remains a place for scrimmage, though, with many of these events being more informal affairs.

In addition to the above, remember that there are two open Short Track events this Sunday: the low-contact event in Halifax, and the introduction to Short Track in Worcester.

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention.

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

The `Rabbit Skulls`_ of Avignon are hosting a triple header on Sunday, as part of the general trend this month for French leagues to explode into action during the start of the French season...
This is an international event, with both WFTDA-gender and MRDA-gender games. (There's disagreement between the event description and the most recent post from the Rabbit Skulls on if this is a triple or a double, but we'll assume the most recent post is accurate.)

- Harpies (Milan) versus Bloody Skulls (Marseille)
- Warren Track Fighters (Avignon M) versus "Mystery Team"
- Rabbit Skulls (Avignon) versus Harpies

`Mexico City Roller Derby`_ host what we believe is a double header event (although all we have on this is a rather gnomic flyer). Once again, it's interesting
to note yet another WFTDA-gender versus MRDA-gender bout as part of the lineup: this is becoming fairly regular in Mexico recently.

- Discordias (EMEXRD \| Mexico City) versus Quimeras (LRDCM \| Mexico City)
