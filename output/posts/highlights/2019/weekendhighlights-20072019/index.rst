This weekend (and the week leading to it) is pretty dominated by the world's largest annual Roller Derby event, Rollercon. With people travelling across the world to attend, the schedule elsewhere is a little sparse, but there are still exciting things happening.

We've also included a bonus section in this week's roundup highlighting sessions at Rollercon itself which we think are either interesting, or important, or both.

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

Special edition addition: ROLLERCON
=====================================

Everyone is probably very aware that this week is Rollercon 2019, in Las Vegas, NV.
We're going to do a quick highlight of some of the more interesting things scheduled for the 2019 edition. Obviously there's too much to even summarise here, so we've tried to pick a few topics we think need highlighting, aside from usual challenge games etc.

**Short Track Roller Derby**

`Rolla Skate Club`_'s Short Track Roller Derby ruleset returns to Rollercon (having made its world-debut there in 2018).

- 1650 Friday, Training Track 4 (MVP tickets): A-C level Short Track intro and training w/ Booty Quake & Luludemon.
- 2000 Friday, Competition Track 4: Short Track Open Scrimmage
- 1800 Saturday, Training Track 3 (MVP tickets): A-C level Short Track intro and training w/ Booty Quake & Luludemon
- 2045 Saturday, Competition Track 3: WFTDA-D1-level Short Track exhibition game ("Short Skirts" versus "Short Sleeves")

.. _Rolla Skate Club: https://rollaskateclub.com/short-track-roller-derby-resources/

**Queer Skate Alliance**

Queer Skate Alliance has been doing sterling work since their formation less than a year ago. If there's an *important* challenge game at this Rollercon, their exhibition showcase is it.

- 2000 Friday, Challenge Track 1

**Rollercon Nations Tournament**

A fixture of Rollercons for the last few years has been the `mini-Nations tournament`_, pitting a growing number of RDWC-National teams against each other.

This year we have: Team Indigenous, Team Korea, Team Canada, Team Philippines, Jewish Roller Derby and a Japan team competing for the championship.

- 0930-1615 Friday, Competition Track 3: "Playoffs series"
- 1500 Saturday, Competition Track 1: Nations Championship bout

.. _mini-Nations tournament: http://rollercon.com/events/tournaments/

**Derby without Borders**

The fantastic Derby without Borders project is at Rollercon, with a seminar session aimed at growing the project's support further. Since 2017, they've come a huge way (see our interview with founder, Mae Dae, `here`__), and they can go even further, with more support.

- 1300 Thursday, Seminar Room 3
- 1630 Saturday, Seminar Room 5

.. __: https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/derby-without-borders-one-year-catchup/

**WFTDA Roller Derby World Summit and Officiating Clinic**

WFTDA are taking advantage of the nexus of derby that is Rollercon to host an associated World Summit event here. Some of the seminar sessions are particularly relevant for the future of the sport, and we'd encourage people to attend.

There's a lot of events in the summit, so we're just highlighting the most "interesting" one of the set to us.

- Wednesday through Sunday: `WFTDA Officiating Clinic`_ .

  - important sessions (as well as the usual rules and positions) on: Avoiding Burnout, Career Pathing and Footage Review.
  - 10 "Feedback games" and 4 "Observation games" for development.

- 1100 Saturday, Seminar Room 3: "WFTDA Gender Policy and Open Division Feedback", especially interesting to see a new direction WFTDA is building in.

.. _WFTDA Officiating Clinic: http://rollercon.com/events/wftda-officiating-clinic/

**Seminar Selection**

Finally, here's one or two seminars we think have useful and relevant topics for Roller Derby right now in 2019:

- 1500 Wednesday, Seminar Room 7: "Announcing: No, You Can't Say That" (Merry Khaos, AFTDA President)

- 1715 Thursday & 1830 Friday, Seminar Room 3: "Kick Your League's Toxic Culture in the Ass!" (Rita Giddens, Fort Myers Roller Derby)

- 1230 Friday, Lower Boardroom: "To Wear Many Hats" (Merry Khaos)

- 1500 Friday, LVCC North entrance: "Photographing Skaters masterclass" (Lenny Gilmore)
