Followers of the Blog will remember our regular feature rounding up all of the Roller Derby around the World.

Whilst we stopped this feature (due to both Facebook's own usability issues, and the sheer amount of work it required each week), we've introduced a scaled down "highlights" feature each week instead.
For the last few weeks, this has been a "Facebook only" feature, mainly because most of the highlighted action in Roller Derby is built around
Facebook Events.

However, as there are many (increasingly so) people who do not, and cannot, use Facebook, we're mirroring it here too (with some additional details to increase accessibility for those who can't access
Events we reference).

This is an exceptionally busy weekend, and we're missing out many events here (including another big tournament in France) - we're trying
to keep this readable by having 1 event per country (Australia only gets two because Tas v Vic has a great bout poster).

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages).
