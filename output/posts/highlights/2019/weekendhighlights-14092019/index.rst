This weekend is another busy one, so we're splitting into this (up to Saturday) and the later (Sunday and Monday) update to fit all the good things in. As well as a second WFTDA Playoffs showcasting Sweden, and giving the UK it's second chance at a Champs place, there's equally exciting action in the USA for Brussels Derby Pixies in California; the finals of Victoria's Statewide Stampede tournament in Australia; the start of Finland's Suomi Cup for 2019/2020... and much more!

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`Kamikaze Badass Roller Derby`_ face Tokyo Roller Derby's `Neon Roller Monsters`_ as the 2019/2020 edition of the mysterious 4x4 Roller Derby Tournament kicks off.
As we mentioned last season, it's been extremely difficult to get information in any detail about this tournament series, other than that it seems to be a Sur5al or Roller
Derby Sevens like short-format endurance ruleset, and involves the leagues around the Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area (regardless of the ruleset they endorse, individually).
We only know of this fixture due to a short-lived "story" post on Kamikaze Badass' instagram account, which we've taken a copy of and hosted here for easier reference.
