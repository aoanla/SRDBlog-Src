This is the Sunday addendum edition of the highlights, for 23 June.

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

There's an unprecedented number of Sunday tournaments in France on the 23rd, so we've picked two of them (the most fun, and the most "international") as a representation. There's actually 5 in total!

There's also one Monday event in the list, so watch out for that in Edinburgh, especially if you're interested in the Officiating side of the sport.

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

Kat Malin-August's series of **NSO Workshops** is now at its fifth edition, and is doing something a little different. Previous sessions have been focused on a particular NSOing role, but this one covers what we'd call "essential officiating ambient knowledge". That is: all the things that experienced officials "just pick up" over years of officiating, but never think to actually have a session on.

This will include, but not limited to: Completing and maintaining a games history, how to apply for tournaments, how WFTDA Cert + Online Training works, recommendations for paraphernalia (whistles, stopwatches etc), and recommendations for other resources.

Sign up is still open, and as always, these workshops are free.

Event starts: 1900 *Monday*

Venue: CodeBase, Argyle House, 38 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh, Scotland


Sun: Birmingham, UK
