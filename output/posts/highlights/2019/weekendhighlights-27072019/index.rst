This is another single-update for the entire weekend - but that doesn't mean it's not exciting! We have a lot of derby happening across the world, including a three-day bootcamp in Estonia (covering WFTDA, Roller Derby Sevens and Short Track), and even more variant games in Australia, as South Sea Roller Derby host another Rainbow Lightning tournament (which is a ruleset we'd love to see people try in Europe sometime).

In Scotland, New Town Roller Derby host a Charity LGBT scrimmage, to support West Lothian Pride.

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`South Sea Roller Derby`_ hosts the return of their variant short-format-but-also-endurance ruleset, Rainbow Lightning, for an evening of derby.
Rainbow Lightning has 1 jam per game... but that jam is *10 minutes long*, with no call-offs possible. Skaters can sub in and out during each jam, when they pass the team bench (but new jammers need to get a new initial pass before scoring again) - but there are only 8 skaters per team, so you need to pace your substitutions.

`Railtown Loco Rollers`_ host a triple-header, the last fixture in British Champs Tier 3 West (WFTDA-side). With Severn Roller Torrent already safely at the top of the league table, and playing lowest-placed Stoke, , the real excitement is in the final game: 2nd and 3rd placed Wolverhampton and Railtown vying for that #2 spot which guarantees promotion into Tier 2. With no relegation in Tier 3, #5 Coventry will be looking to push #4 Bridgend down into their old spot, for honour, rather than anything else.

- Severn Roller Torrent (Gloucestershire) versus Stoke City Rollers
- Bridgend Roller Derby versus Coventry Roller Derby
