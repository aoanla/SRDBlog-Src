Our Sunday addendum for this weekend's highlights seems to be where a lot of the action outside WFTDA is: Germany has two fixtures on Sunday, of which we picked the one in Hannover, and there's games in Okinawa, Bath and Buenos Aires...

...but, perhaps most importantly, there's the first ever bout in Tallinn, Estonia, which is also the start of Estonia's first National Tournament series! 

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`Tallinn Roller Derby`_ make history, hosting the first public bout in Tallinn... and the first ever Estonian National tournament (which is a little easier when you have 2 teams in your country, but still). This bout, against Tartu, is planned to be one of three matches across the 2019-2020 season, determining the overall Estonian champion in the conclusion.

Due to limited numbers, this will be a `Roller Derby Sevens`_ bout. Tallinn would also appreciate additional volunteers, officials, announcers and other staffing to support the bout.

This event is a Roller Derby Eesti Liit (the Estonian NGB) event.
