This is a surprisingly really exceptionally busy weekend, so we're definitely going to split this update into two bits (and even then, we'll be unable to cover all the things deserving of highlights this Saturday.)

We're not even mentioning the Short Track Roller Derby events this weekend to save space - they're all in `this roundup post`__ if you want to catch up with them (although we've marked them on the map). They're all highlights, but this is a super busy weekend, so something has to give.

The 3rd fixture of the Chilean national tournament happens this weekend, as does the final of the New Zealand Top 10 Championshops 2019; as well as a number of large tournament events (perhaps the largest being in Sydney, Australia, and Lille, France). There's charity derby in Teesside, and even an international roller derby bootcamp up north in Iceland!

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`Swamp City Roller Derby`_ [link to Facebook] host the 2019 finals of the New Zealand Top 10 Champs, their national tournament series. As the name implies, this final runs as a 10 teams single elimination tournament, with two tiers ("Cup" and "Shield") of prizes (effectively the winner and loser brackets, if this were double-elimination). This event will be livestreamed on `YouTube`__ .
