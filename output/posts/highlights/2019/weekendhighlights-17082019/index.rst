The big highlight for this week in Scotland is obviously the return of Chaos on the Clyde in Glasgow; but we'd also like to call out Mendoza's first big (international) tournament, Gatorneo.

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space. In this case, there's three Argentine events, because we really want to highlight how much exciting stuff is happening in Latin America right now.

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`Glasgow Roller Derby`_ host the return of their post-season tournament, Chaos on the Clyde. We have a more detailed article on this `here`__ . Day tickets for this event are priced on a sliding scale, based on what the attendee can afford, as a community-positive inclusivity policy. We believe that this will be a full round-robin for 4 teams (6 games total, 3 on each day).
