This is a pretty busy weekend, so we're just doing whole-weekend and Saturday fixtures in this update, with Sunday's selection in a follow-up article.
The coming few days, as well as seeing the first of the WFTDA Playoffs (with attendees from) also see the first in a regular series of Short Track events in the UK, a a gaggle of bootcamps and clinics from the UK to Argentina, and even more tournaments. In National tournaments, Chile hosts the 2nd and 3rd fixtures in its Torneo X, in Vi

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`Northland Nightmares Junior Roller Derby`_ host the first of a hoped-to-be annual Junior Roller Derby tournament in New Zealand: The Younger Games. This will also be the first ever JRDA-rules tournament in New Zealand at all!
The hope is that this tournament will provide additional encouragement for more Junior Roller Derby teams to form in the country, as well as giving the existing teams much-needed track time.

This event will be livestreamed (details not available yet)

`Greensboro Roller Derby`_ host the first `WFTDA Playoffs`_ of this season, of interest to us due to the participation of (deep breath): *2x4 Roller Derby* (Argentina); *Helsinki Roller Derby* (Finland); *Paris Rollergirls* and *Lomme Roller Girls* (France); *Bear City Roller Derby* (Germany); and *Rainy City Roller Derby* (UK). That's fully half the tournament represented by non-USA teams, which is extremely good for international roller derby.

There will also be a Lady Trample-run Chicks in Bowls 'Shred session' on the following Monday, and the usual WFTDA contact options during Playoffs.

*Note: at the time of writing, Hurricane Dorian is predicted to pass across, or close to, parts of North Carolina on Friday, with Winston-Salem at the western edge of the prediction envelope. At present, it is too early to say if evacuation will be ordered, due to the inherent uncertainty in hurricane modelling.*
