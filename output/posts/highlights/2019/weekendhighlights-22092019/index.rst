As usual when a Saturday is busy, we float the Sunday events over to a separate addendum. Sunday seems to be the preferred day for things in Latin America, with two events in Bogotá (including a collaboration exercise between 4 of the local leagues), one in Mexico, and the previously mentioned Patagonian bootcamp in run by Vendaval in Argentina.

The UK, meanwhile is full of bootcamps and mini-bootcamps for all those not at British Champs over the weekend...

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`Combativas Revoltosas`_ , `Central Derby DC`_, `Kings Roller Derby`_ and `Vanguardia Roller Derby`_ co-host a friendly "integration afternoon", which seems to be something like an open friendly scrimmage and time for coordination and collaboration between Bogotá's leagues.

`Rock City Roller Derby`_ host a double-header of Mexican Roller Derby, with both of their teams taking on teams from Mexico City. The more interesting bout, perhaps, is the second, as we rarely see WFTDA-gender teams playing against MRDA-gender opponents.
