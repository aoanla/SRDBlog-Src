This is another "all weekend in one update" set of highlights, although there are several exciting events this weekend: the first fixture of the Chilean national tournament, the Torneo X, in Valdivia; the MRDA Men's European Qualifiers in Aberdeen; and Argentina meet Uruguay in Buenos Aires, for one of Tempestad Roller Derby's first games (plus raising funds for 2x4 to attend in WFTDA Playoffs).

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).
