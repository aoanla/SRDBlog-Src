This is the Sunday addendum edition of the highlights, for 16 June.

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

We're slightly breaking our usual rule this Sunday to allow two events for France. The French schedule of events is so dense, we end up overlooking many of them each weekend in only picking one, so we're selecting two equally important fixtures for this Sunday.

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

The `Roadkill Rollers`_ host their inaugural "Small Teams Tournament", a one-day event aimed at giving smaller teams more opportunities to play in a tournament environment. This is an 8 team tournament, organised as 2 groups of 4, into a final between the top team in each group (for a total of 13 games in the day). Each game is 20 minutes long, based on the schedule. The tournament is OTA, but not all teams are.

`Leicestershire Dolly Rockit Rollers`_ are also helping to give people more games, with their "Love at First Fight", a WFTDA-gender policy rookie & intermediate tournament.
This is a three-team round-robin tournament with teams mixed up from the skaters signed up, with the three 30 minute games ending in a 40-minute final (presumably a rematch between the two highest ranked teams).

`Atlántico Sur`_ . `Cobra Quads`_ . `MDQueens`_ . `Rebeldes del Asfalto Roller Derby`_ and `Sudestada Roller Derby Necochea`_ are collaborating on a series of "Officials on the Atlantic Coast" referee and NSO clinics, designed to build and strengthen the officiating community along the Necochea to Mar del Plata area. (This is necessary to enable the proper support of Roller Derby in this area of Argentina, where, as you can see, there's a lot of teams already!). This first edition is hosted by Atlántico Sur in Miramar.
