As there's a bit less on this weekend, we're doing the one update of Highlights for Saturday through Monday.

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

This weekend has some excitingly huge tournaments, in Australia in particular, but also France; as well as some big bootcamps (in Germany, and China). It's also the weekend of the last fixtures in the French and Finnish national tournaments - and the first ever fixture in the ARDE-run Spanish National Championships!

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`Northern Brisbane Rollers`_ host the 2019 edition of the Royal Rumble tournament, one of the famously huge regular Australiasian tournaments. This event has two divisions: an "indie" and a WFTDA division. The WFTDA bouts seem to be already set, to get WFTDA sanctioned games; the indie division is organised as a group
stage (with 4 groups of 3), into additional approximate placement games for the #1 and #2 teams from the groups.

It appears to us that the "Indie teams" bouts are also less than the standard 2x30 minute period length...

(For survivors still in Beijing on Sunday, there's a lunch debrief and get together.)
