<html><body><p>The second iteration of <strong><a href="http://www.britishchamps.com/womens-fixtures-2016/">British Champs Tier 1</a></strong> is almost at an end, with only one more bout to play (Royal Windsor versus London Rollergirls B, which won't change the table significantly).

There've been big changes in the rankings of the few teams which remained in British Champs for the second round; but most of the Tier 1 teams from the 2015 season declined to return for 2016, so we don't know precisely how they would have placed.

Luckily, a few fortuitous match-ups have given us some hint of what might have happened in recent weeks. Of the teams which did not return in 2016, Rainy City Roller Derby and Tiger Bay Brawlers both took on Glasgow [the only Tier 1 member to return] last weekend. Rainy City also played Kallio Rolling Rainbow that same weekend - just after Kallio had played another 2015 Tier 1 competitor, Auld Reekie Roller Girls.

So, this gives us points of comparison for three of the five teams who left after season 1. The others, Central City Roller Girls and Middleborough Milk Rollers, are a little harder to get comparisons for, as they've had a quite quiet year to date. However, both have played London B quite recently, so we can use that for comparison.

As more data is always useful, we also note that Dublin have played Auld Reekie, Newcastle and Tiger Bay Brawlers; and Berlin have played both Kallio and Glasgow, serving as an additional check on the inferences "via" an intervening team.

We entered all of these bouts, as well as the results from Tier 1 British Champs 2016 to date, into our Bayesian strength estimator. [This is the same one which <strong><a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/03/27/international-and-national-derby-for-easter-the-review/">we used earlier</a></strong> on in 2016 to predict Newcastle as likely winners, with a slight case for Leeds second, or maybe London B - which turns out to be pretty close to the end result.].

As a recap, here's what the table was like for British Champs 2015:

While we're sure that the 5 "ex-Champs" leagues have benefitted from the additional time to spend in the USA, it might cheer them to know that on their current performance, a return to Champs might see them doing okay on that table, too!</body></html>
