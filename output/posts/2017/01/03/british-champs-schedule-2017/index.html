<p>So, by now you're probably aware that the British Championships 2017 schedule is out (it's hosted here: <strong><a href="http://www.britishchamps.com/2017-british-roller-derby-champs-fixtures/">http://www.britishchamps.com/2017-british-roller-derby-champs-fixtures/</a></strong> in a big, searchable, list).</p>
<p>As the list is pretty long, we thought we'd pull out some key dates for you (and also tip our hand a bit as to teams and divisions we'll be focussing a little more on - Talk Derby To Me will be continuing their excellent overall Champs coverage this year for those who want to cover the whole thing):</p>
<p>The <strong>Women's Tier 1</strong> kicks off on the <strong>26th</strong> of <strong>Feb</strong>ruary, with a double header featuring Tiger Bay Brawlers against newly-merged Leeds Roller Derby, and Birmingham Blitz Dames against Bristol Roller Derby hosted by TBB in Cardiff.</p>
<p>The <strong>Men's Tier 1</strong> also begins a few weeks later in Wales, as South West Silures host the Crash Test Brummies on the <strong>11th</strong> of <strong>Mar</strong>ch.</p>
<p>However, by then, most of the other Tiers will have had their first bouts, with the whole British Champs schedule starting on the <strong>4th</strong> of <strong>Feb</strong>ruary, as the <strong>Men's Tier 2</strong> begins with Barrow Infernos hosting Southern Discomfort B (the first B team in the Men's tiers).</p>
<p>Friends of the blog, <strong>Newcastle Roller Girls</strong>, see their B-team, the Whippin' Hinnies, compete for the first time in <strong>Women's Tier 2 North</strong> on the <strong>11th</strong> of <strong>Mar</strong>ch, in a battle of the B-teams against Rainy City Roller Derby's formidable Tender Hooligans; hosted by Wirral Roller Derby, this is also somewhat Manchester area themed, as the second bout of the fixture is hosts versus Manchester Roller Derby.</p>
<p>But you'll have to wait until April to see some <em>Scottish Women</em>'s action in the Champs, as <strong>Granite City Roller Derby</strong> host a <strong>Women's Tier 3 North</strong> double header on the <strong>22nd</strong> of <strong>Apr</strong>il. <strong>Auld Reekie Roller Girls</strong>' Reserves are travelling up to Aberdeen to take on the hosts, whilst Furness Firecrackers and Halifax Bruising Banditas will be coming up to play each other.</p>
<p><em>Scottish Men</em>'s Derby also has its first showing in Champs that month, as Men Behaving Derby host a <strong>Men's Tier 3 North</strong> fixture on the <strong>16th</strong> of <strong>Apr</strong>il; pitting <strong>Bairn City Rollers</strong>' Skelpies against the hosts, followed by Teeside Skate Invaders facing off against <strong>Glasgow Men's Roller Derby</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, whilst the <strong>Women's Tier 4</strong> North starts its series a few weeks earlier, we'll be following friends of the blog (and some of our first interviewees!) <strong>York Minxters</strong> - their first bout is on the <strong>25th</strong> of <strong>Mar</strong>ch against Wakey Wheeled Cats, in Mansfield; the second bout is hosts against Durham Roller Derby.</p>
