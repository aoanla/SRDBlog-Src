<div>Following on from last month's inaugural diary entry by <a href="http://nastynessiesrollergirls.wordpress.com/">Nasty Nessies</a> chair Irn-Bruzer, here's her nomination for December: the striking Nat-orious Red, causing our article title to become rather alliterative.</div>

<div><strong>What first attracted you to Roller Derby?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>I was looking for a way to get fit but at the same time have fun! I found out roller derby was coming to Inverness and just jumped at the chance to join. I had heard about it before but never really thought I would be able to do it (I'm super clumsy!), now I don't know what I was worried about, it is the best thing I've ever done and the girls are all amazing. We are all like minded and just want to skate.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>How did you chose your name? I guess your first name is Natalie...</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Yeah it is.. I had lots and lots of ideas but I just couldn't decide between them all, I managed to narrow it down and finally picked one but, of course, I changed my mind again after a few weeks when I thought of Nat-orious Red: it seemed more fitting in account of my bright red hair!</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>What was your biggest initial difficulty?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>My biggest difficulty was getting over the fear of falling! (I know! I know!  silly it's roller derby your gonna fall!) but the first few weeks I didn't and because of that I was too scared to go faster or try anything other than the basics, finally one lovely practice day I took a really hard land on my butt and that was not as bad as I imagined it would be. I fall or stumble a lot more now and it doesn't bother me it just means I'm trying harder...</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>I find it hard to stop talking about derby; it's always a talking point for me so anyone I meet hears about it whether they like it or not. Thankfully most people love it so that's good.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/ done this month?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>The most important thing I've learnt is probably getting my endurance up: I never realised just how unfit I was until I had to skate for a longer time than normal or when I tried my 25/5<a>.</a> My first attempt I got 25 in 5.09, which is better than I thought I would get but still not good enough so practice! practice! practice!.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>What’s new in NNRG?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Well we had our first bootcamp last week courtesy of the lovely granite city girls, they really helped us perfect a few things showing us their techniques and it was extremely helpful.</div>
<div>Also we are having a fundraising bake sale this Sunday with a lot of the girls ( myself included) making lots of scrumptious goodies.</div>
<div>And last but not least we have been given a sponsorship deal with the Rileys sports club! Which is absolutely amazing: we are all super excited about it. So it's been a pretty good month for us, we have achieved quite a bit and we are sure next month will be just as good.</div>
