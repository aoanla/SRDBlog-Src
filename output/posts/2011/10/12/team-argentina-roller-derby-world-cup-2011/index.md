Team Argentina are playing exhibition bouts with a split team as part of their preparations and will no doubt be soaking up all the lessons that their skaters from US leagues can pass on.They plan to travel early to Toronto, get in some practice time and gel their skaters together.
The girls that skate for US leagues,<em>do</em> skate for some pretty major ones...Gotham and the LA Derby Dolls among them,these girls will doubtless have a wealth of experience in terms of training and in bouting and scrimmaging against some of the best leagues in the world.It only remains to be seen if Team Argentina can absorb and adapt.</body></html>
