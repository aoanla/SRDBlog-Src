<html><body><p>I thought i would highlight a few of the best Roller Derby videos doing the rounds on Youtube,theres quite a lot out there,so this may turn into a series.

All these feature American Leagues,and yes there will be a Scottish league post at some point.Theres quite a bit of background info on Derby in these videos,from how the sport is played,to an insight into how much hard work actually goes on behind the scenes to run a league.All interesting and indeed, educational stuff.

First up is Roller Derby Revival,from the Cincinnatti Rollergirls
