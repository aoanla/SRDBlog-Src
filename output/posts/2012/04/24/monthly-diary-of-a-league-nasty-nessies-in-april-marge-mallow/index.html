<p>Quick on the heels of our last monthly diary, here's the <a href="http://nastynessiesrollergirls.wordpress.com/">Nasty Nessies</a>' entry for April, the probably-not-as-toastable-as-her-namesake Marge Mallow!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/04/marge.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1119" title="marge" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/04/marge.jpeg" alt="" width="370" height="552"></a></p>
<p><strong>What first attracted you to Roller Derby?</strong></p>
<p>I didn't have a clue it existed until about 8 months ago but when I first heard about it and did a little research, it came across as a fun, fast paced, exciting sport. I also liked the danger aspect and also the fact that it's not ageist or sizeist or any other 'ist'</p>
<p><strong>Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when you're starting out. How did you choose your name, and how does it reflect your personality on track?</strong></p>
<p>Choosing a name is so difficult and frustrating. There are so many out there that are already spoken for and just when you think you've found a good one, the register of derby names is updated and bam! you find out someone has beaten you to the post and it's time to find another name. Marge Mallow came about as I'm soft and sweet to begin with but too much and I'll make you sick</p>
<p><strong>What was your biggest initial difficulty?</strong></p>
<p>Parting with the money for kit that you need to take part but are not sure if you'll stick at it long enough to justify it. Also, getting my mouth guard moulded to fit properly was stupidly difficult!</p>
<p><strong>Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word?</strong></p>
<p>Talking about it to friends and family, facebooking, wearing my team hoodie out n about.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/ done this month?</strong></p>
<p>Most important thing I've done... I passed my mins, Yeah! Most important thing I've learnt... I passed my mins, Yeah! Sorry, but I'm so chuffed with myself. Did I mention I passed my mins?</p>
<p><strong>What were the most difficult and the best things?</strong></p>
<p>Um, these questions are pretty difficult but also my first attempt at 25 laps in 5 mins was the most difficult thing I've done, or not done as the case may be as I didn't manage it first time. Bad breathing technique cost me that one I reckon. Best thing is probably the team. I've never done a team sport and to be in such a diverse group of people that work together so well is just amazing. Sickening but true.</p>
<p><strong>What's new for the Nessies this month?</strong></p>
<p>We've been a busy bunch of Nessies this month. There's been a lot of hard work and effort all round that has resulted in many of us passing our mins. Did I mention I'd passed mine?</p>
