<p>Perhaps just a smidgeon late, it's time for Inverness's <a href="http://nastynessiesrollergirls.wordpress.com/home/">Nasty Nessies</a> to make their monthly diary entry. This February, it's <strong>Belle Block-H</strong>!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/03/izzy.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-924" title="izzy" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/03/izzy.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="848"></a></p>
<p><strong>What first attracted you to Roller Derby?</strong></p>
<p>I was really attracted to the thought of doing something totally different but getting fit at the same time, and I liked the idea of getting involved in a women's sport that was open to people of all ages, size and ability.  Also the promise of a whole new social life!</p>
<p><strong>Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when</strong> <strong>you're starting out. How did you choose your name, and how does it</strong> <strong>reflect your personality on track?</strong></p>
<p>I'm a huge fan of Prisoner: Cell Block H (for those that don't know - it was an 80s  Australian drama series set in a women's prison) my real name is Isabel and one of my friends suggested Belle Block H as a Derby name (thanks Fi!).  I don't think it really reflects my personality as such but it's a nice link to one of my off track quirks.</p>
<p><strong>What was your biggest initial difficulty?</strong></p>
<p>Standing up! with great excitement I laced up my skates for the first time then I realised I had to somehow stand up.  I got there though (thanks to my hubby Nick for holding my hand!) and I started moving about slowly.  I hadn't been on skates since I was a child so it was somewhat intimidating and  It took me quite a long time to get over the fear of falling.</p>
<p><strong>Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their</strong> <strong>new sport. How have you been spreading the word?</strong></p>
<p>My family, friends and colleauges all know that I play Roller derby.  Some had never heard of it but everyone has been interested and enthusiastic.  My 2 year old son now has his own pair of roller skates that he calls "car shoes" and my niece was gutted that you have to be over 18 - she's 12 and wants to play roller derby (she lives in Aberdeen so maybe a future Granite City Roller girl?!)</p>
<p><strong>What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/done this month?</strong></p>
<p>It's taken a while but I've managed to really get my speed up due to the fact I can now do much more efficient crossovers.  Going to see my first live bout was also a highlight of this month - most of NNRG travelled down to Perth to watch Granite City's Slaughtership Down bout; I have to say they make it look incredibly easy but I know it's actually really tough.</p>
<p><strong>What were the most difficult and best things you’ve done?</strong></p>
<p>The best thing was probably just managing to get back on skates after having to take a couple of weeks out in January as I'd hurt my back (not derby related!) and also skating with my awesome new wheels - they've made such a difference for me. The most difficult part is probably pushing myself really hard to get my speed and endurance up so I can hopefully pass my 25 in 5 in a few weeks - it's really tough to keep going when your thighs are burning but my fitness has definitely improved in the last few months.</p>
<p><strong>What’s new in NNRG?</strong></p>
<p>We've had quite a few girls pass their 25 in 5 this month so everyone is training hard and getting really close to passing their mins which is really exciting - it'll definitely be a big milestone for NNRG.  We're also taking on  newbies again so anyone interested can come along to one of our Wednesday night sessions to see what it's all about.</p>
<p>Those Wednesday night sessions are advertised on the <a href="http://nastynessiesrollergirls.wordpress.com/2012/02/29/nasty-nessies-are-recruiting/">Nasty Nessies website</a>.</p>
<p>Next (well, this) month's entry will be by <strong>Bee-Yatch</strong>.</p>
