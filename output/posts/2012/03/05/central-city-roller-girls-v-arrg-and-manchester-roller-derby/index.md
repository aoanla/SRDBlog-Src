Auld Reekie Roller Girls travel down south to take part in a double header presented by <a href="http://centralcityrollergirls.co.uk/">Central City Roller Girls</a> on the 10th of march at Cocks Moors Woods Leisure Centre,Birmingham.
First CCR's Slay Belles will play Manchester Roller Derby and then the main event will be the Centrinnians up against ARRG's Twisted Thistles.
There is a bit of history between the two teams,but ARRG have always emerged the victors in their bouts so far.Will CCR turn the tide?...should make for a great bout.</body></html>
