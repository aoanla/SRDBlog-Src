<strong>What first attracted you to roller derby?</strong>
I found out about it through a friend and went through to the Fresh Meat Intake in October 2011. As soon as I strapped on the skates I felt like a kid again! I felt like I was racing around the track like a gazelle, it felt so natural. In reality, I was flailing all over the shop, making a racket and probably wrecking the skates! But I felt something I had not felt in a long time, utter joy and a feeling of falling in love. All I could do was think about derby.

<strong>Who are your derby heroes?</strong>
I have many. Pretty much any derby girls I meet, everyone who is part of derby who helps, NSO’s, the Refs, the announcers, the fundraisers, the trainers. Everyone. They are all so important and make each league function. I also tip my hat to anyone who has never heard of roller derby and has to put up with me talking about it….endlessly.

<strong>How did you choose your name, and how does it reflect your personality on track?</strong>
I had a few floating about, even had my boyfriend thinking up a few but they just didn’t suit. I thought of Dita Von Cheese, because it’s just silly and that’s just me. I wouldn’t suit a scary name or a witty one either. Also, I want to have a logo with a flaming cheese and a sexy mouse.

<strong>What was your biggest initial difficulty?</strong>
My physical fitness level at the start was atrocious. I had roller bladed and ice skated when I was younger, so the actual movements were not the problem. I had left my job as a post lady in favor of an office job and was still smoking, so I had a lot of work to do. Mentally, it was seeing the experienced skaters doing their thing and making it look so easy! I found I was getting frustrated at being unable to keep up, but after a while I slowly got better.

<strong>Lots of girls find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word? </strong>
By not shutting up about it! I recently went up north to my home town near Aberdeen for a night out. I found myself pimping out Granite City Roller Girls; I believe you have 3 ladies and a guy interested : D

<strong>What’s the most important thing you’ve learned/done this month?</strong>
There are a few things coming to mind, firstly I have learned I am terrible at 10 pin bowling (we recently had a FVRG night out), that the best bruises are the ones you get from landing on your OWN wheels, and how to effectively counter-block a-la-Psychomilly [of Dundee Roller Girls], who was a guest trainer last week.

<strong>What were the most difficult and the best things?</strong>
I think the tricky part in derby is tactics. There are so many ways to approach a situation, and so many ways it can unfold. I find myself completely lost sometimes and I am in awe of any skater who knows what to do and how to get it done, in two minutes, without being floored, binned or breaking a sweat.
The best thing? Right at the start of a bout/scrim. There is endless possibility of what could happen. I like that feeling.

<strong>What’s new for the Fierce Valley this month?</strong>
This month everyone is buckling down and getting ready for tryouts at the start of October. We have our first ever home bout on the 17th November; ‘'For whom the skate rolls’’ against the Wirral Whipiteres. Bring on the Metallica themed bout! \m/</p></body></html>
