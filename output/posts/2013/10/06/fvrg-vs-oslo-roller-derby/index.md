<html><body><p>On Saturday 30th November, <a title="Oslo Roller Derby Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/oslorollerderby" target="_blank">Oslo Roller Derby</a> will visit The Peak in Stirling to take on <a title="FVRG Website" href="http://www.fvrg.co.uk/index.php" target="_blank">Fierce Valley Roller Girls.</a>

Although the Norwegian team is a year younger than FVRG, they have lots of bouting experience, and were accepted into the <a title="WFTDA Apprentice Leagues" href="http://wftda.com/leagues/apprentice" target="_blank">WFTDA Apprentice Program</a> in January this year. The teams are within touching distance of each in the <a title="Derby Data Europe Website" href="http://derbydataeurope.com/2013/09/06/european-roller-derby-rankings-august-2013/" target="_blank">European Rankings</a> - so this promises to be a nail-biter of a bout!

Doors open at 2pm, with the first whistle being blown at 2:30pm. There will be a selection of craft stalls to keep you occupied while you wait, or if you fancy a half-time treat.

Tickets are available at £5 (+ admin fee) online from <a title="Buy tickets from Brown Paper Tickets" href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/483199" target="_blank">Brown Paper Tickets</a>, or £7 on the door. Kids aged 14 and under are invited along for free with a paying adult.
