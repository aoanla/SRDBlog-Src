Both teams are keen to hold onto their recent winning streaks, with Barrow beating <a title="Wirral Men's Roller Derby Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/ThePackAnimals" target="_blank">Wirral Men's Roller Derby</a> and <a title="Bairn City Rollers Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers" target="_blank">Bairn City Rollers' </a>Skelpies, where as The Jakey's have beaten <a title="Team Steve Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Team-Steve/261667917252555?fref=ts" target="_blank">Team Steve </a>and <a title="Super Smash Broller Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/supersmashbrollers" target="_blank">Super Smash Brollers</a>. If you are yet to see any Men's Roller Derby, this will be a great first experience!

The November bout will be The Jakey's first outing since July, when <a title="The Jakey Bites Take on Europe!" href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/07/10/the-jakey-bites-take-on-europe/" target="_blank">they played in the Men's European Roller Derby Championships</a>. The team played excellently in the tournament, and learnt a lot from the experience that they have taken back to the training room. Their hard work will hopefully pay off when they come face-to-face with the team from Barrow-In-Furness next weekend.
