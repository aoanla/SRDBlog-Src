We featured the Divas in our end of year round up, along with other newer Scottish leagues, so you can read about them <a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/12/31/scotlands-newest-leagues-a-year-in-derby/">here</a>.

Those interested should contact them on their <a href="http://www.facebook.com/deadlydivasrollerderby">facebook</a> page, or via <a href="mailto:DeadlyDivasRD@gmail.com">email</a>.</body></html>
