<html><body><p>On Saturday 6th July, The Jakey Bites will take on Team Steve at Grangemouth Sports Centre.

And "Who are Team Steve?", I hear you ask! They formed in 2011 with a 'Best of the Rest' line-up after the women's Team Scotland selection, and  have bouted against Team Scotland since the 2011 World Cup. With a few changes to the original team roster, skaters from <a title="Dundee Roller Girls website" href="http://dundeerollergirls.com/" target="_blank">Dundee Roller Girls</a>, <a title="Auld Reekie Roller Girls website" href="http://arrg.co.uk/" target="_blank">Auld Reekie Roller Girls</a>, <a title="Glasgow Roller Derby website" href="http://glasgowrollerderby.com/" target="_blank">Glasgow Roller Derby</a> and <a title="Granite City Roller Girls website" href="http://granitecityrollergirls.org.uk/" target="_blank">Granite City Roller Girls</a> will return to take on The Jakeys.

The last Jakey Bites bout in Grangemouth was a sell-out, and this one looks set to be just as popular!
