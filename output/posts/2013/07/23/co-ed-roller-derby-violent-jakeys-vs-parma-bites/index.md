<html><body><p>Co-Ed Roller Derby has recently taken hold of the traditionally female sport, and <a title="FVRG Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/FierceValleyRG" target="_blank">Fierce Valley Roller Girls</a> want a piece of the action!   Scottish Men's team, <a title="The Jakey Bites Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheJakeyBites" target="_blank">The Jakey Bites</a>, have already played with Dundee's Silvery Tayzers and Aberdeen's Granite City Roller Girls, but how will they fare playing against (or with!) FVRG's Parma Violents?

Both teams will be taken out of their comfort zone as each line-up will feature male and female skaters. So what will these mixed teams be called? Violent Jakeys and Parma Bites, naturally.

Come along to The Peak in Stirling on Saturday 10th August for a guaranteed action-packed afternoon. Tickets are £7 on the door (under 12s go free with a paying adult). Doors open at 2pm for a 2:30pm start. Further details available on the <a title="Facebook Event" href="https://www.facebook.com/FierceValleyRG?ref=hl#!/events/381912665243385/" target="_blank">Facebook Event</a>.
