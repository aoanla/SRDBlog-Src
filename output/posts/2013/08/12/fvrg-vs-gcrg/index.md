Doors open at 3pm for a 3:30pm start. There will be a selection of craft stalls and a bake sale to keep you occupied while you wait!

Tickets are available at £5 (+ admin fee) online from <a title="Buy tickets from Brown Paper Tickets" href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/444962" target="_blank">Brown Paper Tickets</a>, or £7 on the door. Kids aged 14 and under are invited along for free with a paying adult. Due to the limited seating at this venue, it is recommended that you buy your tickets (or get the free kids passes) in advance.
