<p>Starting a slightly expanded array of Monthly Diaries this month, <a href="www.fvrg.co.uk">Fierce Valley Roller Girls</a> bring you: Must-Dash!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/06/603122_205960202875611_438612260_n.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2710" alt="Must-Dash with Mustache!" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/06/603122_205960202875611_438612260_n.jpg?w=614" width="614" height="921"></a> Must-Dash with Mustache!</p>
<p><strong>What first attracted you to Roller Derby?</strong></p>
<p></p>
</div>
What first attracted me to derby was my sister the infamous Danger Mouth, I went along with her at the beginningish when ARRG was in it's early stages but alas I just was not completely ready for the world of derby then... so I put it on the back burner... silly Dash.
<div>
<p><strong>Who are your derby heroes?</strong></p>
<p></p>
</div>
Danger Mouth is my main hero, her hits are intense: I remember stupidly requesting one from her at a training practice and I went quite some distance and pretty sure I was smacked off the wall a little... ahhh good times.
<div>
<p><strong>Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when you're starting out. How did you choose your name, and how does it reflect your personality on track?</strong></p>
<p></p>
</div>
My name came about for my love of moustaches: all those gentlemen with their fine facial accessories, their lip quivering no more in the cold air of an evening stroll.
<p>So how does my name transpire on track, I am a true gent and always try and open the opposing  walls for my ladies... and I have become a bit better at dashing as a Jammer.
</p>
<div>
<p><strong>What was your biggest initial difficulty?</strong></p>
<p></p>
</div>
I would have to say cross overs, they were a real beach... and my 25 in 5; I forget just how unfit I was before I committed myself more fully to derby, joining FVRG has helped me grow as a skater and a person so much. I just couldn't wish for a more supportive driven derby family, not to mention funtasticical.
<div>
<p><strong>Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word?</strong></p>
<p></p>
</div>
I constantly tell people at my cafe about the wonderful world of derby: "Here's your bacon roll ma'am, you have strong looking legs... ever considered donning some wheels??"
<div>
<p><strong>What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/ done this month?</strong></p>
<p></p>
</div>
I jammed for the first time in a bout situation which was pretty great, and won the award for best blocker. Needless to say I was on a bit of a high after our intraleague Transformers themed bout.
<p>I have learnt that I can stand on one skated leg whilst making goat noises quite successfully as can my fellow pals deal with me doing this and also keep balance... I was embracing the spirit of the mountain goat to make my balance better.
</p>
<div>
<p><strong>What were the most difficult and the best things?</strong></p>
<p></p>
</div>
The most difficult thing was probably hearing that Maz-manian devil was leaving us :(. Then the best was hearing that she's totally had a change of heart and is coming back! SCORE!! Me and Brawny made a video for her and everything, she even got a leaving party out of us all, she turned our world upside down face... I suppose I can forgive her for lying to us... in time.
<div>
<p><strong>What's new for the Fierce Valley this month?</strong></p>
<p></p>
</div>
We will be beasting the training sessions and scrimming to ready prepare us for July try outs for the FVRG and Jakey Co-ed bout on the 10th of August. We will also be crafting a hefty amount to bring along to the Pop up shop at Callander house which is happening on the 13th of July so it's worth nipping along to see our wares :)</div>
