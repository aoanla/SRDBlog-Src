<html><body><p>On Saturday 14th December, The Jakey Bites <a title="The Jakey Bites Host SUR5AL 2013" href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/10/28/sur5al-2013/">hosted their second 'SUR5AL' Tournament</a> at The Meadowbank Stadium in Edinburgh.

16 teams of 3 females plus 2 males signed up to take part in the tournament, representing many of the Scottish Roller Derby leagues, as well as English teams: Barrow Infernos, Furness Firecrackers, and Blackpool Roller Derby. This year, the event was open to the public. All door takings plus each teams' entry fee was donated to the winner's charity of choice.

The 16 teams were split into 4 groups of 4 teams, with a variety of festive names! Each team played against the other three teams in their group, in 3 sets of 2 minute jams played back-to-back with no time-outs or call-offs. The team who won the most games from their Group then progressed through to the Semi Final.

The day ran extremely smoothly, with Dafty from The Jakeys guiding the teams through their group stages. The NSOs did a fantastic job of telling each team who was up next to play, and the Ref Crews were seamless in their switch-over between games.

Ian McCreadie - an independent photographer - was at The Meadowbank to capture all of the action from the day. He has kindly supplied all of the following images.
