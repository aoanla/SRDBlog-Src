<strong>What first attracted you to Roller Derby?</strong>
My awesome bestie used to play for ARRG (Bobscene Behaviour) and that was my introduction to the game. I watched her in her first bout and left wishing I could give it a try. Fast forwards a few years later and I was a new mum looking for an outlet, some exercise and something that I could do just for me - I saw an advert for New Town Roller Girls and pounced!

<strong>Most skaters have inspirations in their own or other leagues. Who are your derby heroes?</strong>
Bobscene Behavior for introducing me to roller derby (and blocking like a boss). Duke Box is amazing, agile and hits like a wall! Also Lois Maim is all round awesome and so patient when helping me learn hits and blocks.

<strong>Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when you're starting out. How did you choose your name (and number), and does it reflect your personality on track?</strong>
It came to me at work. I'm generally known for being shy and uncertain (unless you really know me well) . I wanted to channel a tougher side so I wanted an aggressive name. Bump-Her Stick-Her is a mantra i can use on track. My number is my daughter Roslyn's birthday 195.

<strong>What's your favourite position and technique?</strong>
I like jamming, I am still learning a lot but I hope I can be a useful jammer some day.

<strong>Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word?</strong>
Facebook :) work, rambling on to hairdressers and by wearing my teams t-shirt whilst running or working out.

<strong>What’s the most important thing you've learnt/ done this month</strong>
Practicing with the boys and girls for our <a title="Bairn City Rollers presents “Day Of Reckoning”" href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/09/10/bairn-city-rollers-presents-day-of-reckoning/">upcoming bout</a> (my cherry popper)

<strong>And the most difficult and the best things?</strong>
The most difficult is the frustration of not picking up a technique. The best is the first time you get it right. You may not always get it but you realise it's possible.

<strong>What's new for the New Town this month?</strong>
First bout. I'm simultaneously excited and terrified. Also the next wave of minimum skills skaters</p></body></html>
