<p style="text-align:right;">A team of inspirational women are helping to cement Glasgow’s sporting legacy in the wake of the Commonwealth Games.</p>
Glasgow Roller Derby are currently making waves in the top tier of the British Roller Derby Championships.
<p>The sensational skaters from the Clyde-side are lighting up the UK Roller Derby Association Premier League – ensuring the sporting feelgood factor from last year’s Games continues.<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4565 alignright" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/02/grd.jpg?w=300" alt="grd" width="300" height="109"></p>
<p>So far Glasgow Roller Derby (GRD) have convincingly beaten Central City RollerGirls from Birmingham and Rainy City Roller Girls from Oldham.</p>
<p>On May 30 and 31, GRD will host two days of British Roller Derby Champs action in Glasgow’s ARC sportscentre (noon-6pm).</p>
<p>It’s going to be a fantastic double-derby spectacular with Glasgow taking on Middlesbrough Milk Rollers. Also in action will be Auld Reekie Roller Girls from Edinburgh, Tiger Bay Brawlers from Cardiff, Central City RollerGirls and Rainy City Roller Girls.</p>
<p>Before that, on May 2 in Edinburgh, Glasgow will be taking on the Tiger Bay Brawlers and Auld Reekie Roller Derby.</p>
<p>It’s all building up to be a magnificent May for GRD and sport in Scotland.</p>
<p>The British Roller Derby Championships is Europe’s largest inter-league Women’s Flat Track Roller Derby Tournament.
</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="../../../../../2015/04/1958232_818634904872056_8852349267584931611_n.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-4635 alignleft" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/04/1958232_818634904872056_8852349267584931611_n.jpg?w=300" alt="1958232_818634904872056_8852349267584931611_n" width="300" height="111"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A total of 72 women’s leagues from Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland are divided into four tiers for double-header bout days spanning the year, with play-offs to find who will be British Roller Derby Champions for 2015.</p>
GRD are currently leading the top tier and everyone within the league is working hard to ensure the good form continues.
<p>A spokeswoman said: “We are delighted to be able to continue the wonderful atmosphere that surrounded the city and its people during the Games and in the aftermath.</p>
<p>“We have some of the best derby teams in the UK coming to Glasgow – giving people the chance to see world-class roller derby right on their doorstep. We can’t wait to welcome the top tier teams to our city and show just why we think we have the best fans in the business.</p>
<p>“All of the skaters involved are top quality so we’re delighted to have won our first two games and to have notched up such a healthy points difference.</p>
<p>“We’re taking nothing for granted though – May is going to push our A-team to the very limit – testing all our skills, strategy, endurance, guile and strength.</p>
<p>“We're hoping for another sell-out when the action comes to Glasgow - showing the sensational support for roller derby north of the border.</p>
<p>"Fasten your seatbelts, folks, it’s going to be an edge-of-your-seat two days of derby.”</p>
<p>She added: “We also hope as many fans as possible can make the trip to Edinburgh to roar us on in the Capital in two thrilling contests.”</p>

<p>The all-female GRD was the first roller derby league to be formed in Scotland – in 2007.</p>
<p>Since then the league has flown the flag across the world – competing in America twice, Europe on a number of occasions and throughout the UK.</p>
<p>The all-star A-team – the Irn Bruisers – are currently ranked 68<sup>th</sup> in the world by the Women’s Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA).</p>
<p>In addition, the UKRDA Q2 rankings have been released, and there has been a change at the top, with Glasgow Roller Derby leapfrogging Auld Reekie Roller Girls into the number one position.</p>
