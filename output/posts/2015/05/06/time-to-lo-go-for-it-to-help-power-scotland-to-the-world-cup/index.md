<html><body><p>Aspiring artists and daring designers can enjoy a brush with success … by designing a logo for Scotland’s national male roller derby team.

Power of Scotland is challenging people to design a new logo for the team as homegrown preparations continue for the Men’s Roller Derby World Cup in Canada next year.

Scottish skaters from across the UK are dreaming of representing their country in Calgary in 2016 – and they could be proudly sporting your logo design on their uniforms.

Manager Nikki Morris said: “Thanks to all those who have already submitted logos for our competition. Rest assured they are all in contention – with some superb ideas in there.

“However, we have decided to extend the deadline to 31 May to give as many people as possible the chance to come up with a corking design which will be the talk of the roller derby world.
</p><p style="text-align:left;">“We are looking for something Scottish themed – unicorns, Nessies, tartan, heritage-related – with a twist.<a href="/2015/05/11194398_10155484951575587_5898386249802980145_o.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-4643 alignright" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/05/11194398_10155484951575587_5898386249802980145_o.jpg?w=219" alt="11194398_10155484951575587_5898386249802980145_o" width="293" height="398"></a></p>
“Remember it doesn’t have to be the same as the previous logo – which will be going in the selection anyway.”

Pictured here is the results poster with all the team logos from 2014 to give you an idea of the style being sought and how designs translate onto print roll.

Please be aware the FINAL closing date is 31 May.
