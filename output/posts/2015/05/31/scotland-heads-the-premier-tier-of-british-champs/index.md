<html><body><p>As of only a few hours ago, the first ever <a href="http://www.britishchamps.com/tables-and-fixtures-ukrda-premier/">British Champs Premier </a>Tier tournament ended, with the 15th and final bout of the series a surprisingly tight and tense bout between Auld Reekie Roller Girls and Central City Rollergirls.
With ARRG emerging victorious, the final placings for the 6 teams in Premier Tier are:

1 Glasgow Roller Derby
2 Auld Reekie Roller Girls
3 Middlesbrough Milk Rollers
4 Tiger Bay Brawlers 
5 Central City Rollergirls
6 Rainy City Roller Girls.

Scottish teams therefore take both 1st and 2nd place in the Tier, and CCR and RCRG will unfortunately relegate to the National Tier for the 2016 season.

Hopefully we will have more from Glasgow and Auld Reekie on their placement later. For now, some initial stats are available <a href="http://aoanla.wordpress.com/2015/05/31/british-championships-premier-tier-some-statistics/">here</a>.</p></body></html>
