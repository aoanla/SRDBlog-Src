<html><body><p>With the excitement of most of the travel season behind them, the home season for <a href="http://www.arrg.co.uk">Auld Reekie Roller Girls</a> and <a href="http://www.dundeerollergirls.com">Dundee Roller Girls</a> is just about to begin. In fact, both leagues are holding their first home teams games <em>this coming weekend</em>.

We know that Auld Reekie's three teams - The Skatefast Club, Leithal Weapons and Cherry Bombers - have all been actively preparing for the coming season, with various scheduled scrims against all comers, so we're sure that this will be a tightly contested season. The first bout, starting at <strong>2pm</strong> at regular venue <strong>Meadowbank Stadium</strong>, sees last season's victors, The Skatefast Club, take on the Leithal Weapons (who, as previous winners, will be wanting to regain that title). There will be a licensed bar, and half-time entertainment!

Meanwhile, Dundee's Jutes of Hazzard, Jammin’ Dodgers and Press Gangers have also been hard at work, to judge from their team twitter accounts. Their first bout is actually a double feature, opening with some Junior Derby from Fierce Valley Roller Cubs, before last season's winners, the Press Gangers, take on the Jutes of Hazzard! You can catch them at Dundee's regular venue, the <strong>Dundee International Sports Centre</strong>, at <strong>1230</strong>.
