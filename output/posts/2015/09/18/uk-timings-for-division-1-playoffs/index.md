Glasgow's first bout will be at <strong>5pm tonight (18 September)</strong> against Charlottesville Derby Dames.

<em>If they win</em>, then their next bout will be at <strong>11pm</strong> against Denver Roller Girls, <em>otherwise</em> they will play the loser of game 3 (probably Tampa Bay) at <strong>5pm tomorrow (19th September)</strong>.
