Last weekend saw Glasgow and Auld Reekie hold their Home Teams finals for 2015, and Dundee Roller Girls are following hot on their heels. This <strong>Saturday 5th</strong> sees the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/681505575326549/">final of their Home Season</a>, which should see the Jutes of Hazzard playing the Press Gangsters for the trophy. Third placed team, the Jammin' Dodgers, will be taking on a mixed team of skaters from other leagues.

Previous games this season saw the Jutes defeat the Jammin' Dodgers by 144 points to 130, and the Gangsters similarly narrowly triumph against the Dodgers by 153 : 146.

The first match up of the season pitted the finalists against one another, with the Gangsters pulling a close win against the Jutes, with the final score 171 to 154, after a tie at half time! With scores this close, the result of the Final is impossible to call, so the only way to find out who wins will be to turn up at the DISC on Saturday.

The weekend also sees Dundee's end of year awards ceremony, which is a more private affair. However, fans of the league have been asked to cast votes for the Fan Favourite award, given to the most popular member of the league (including referees and NSOs).
