<p>	Make it clear</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>		integrating "new intakes"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>		other skating activities to build skills (roller discos, skate parks etc)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>	Feedback forms are important</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>	Stigma from going to other leagues' trainig</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>		be open, have invites, talk about why</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>		good "bootcamps" / could have scenarios for skaters to get creative</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>	Coaches supporting each other during training</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>		burnout, attendance</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>		"build confidence in newer skaters"</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>	Do we need a Scottish Governing Body?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>	"Sport Scotland" access? Funding opportunities?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>	what do we need to lobby at? are we ready for this / do we need this?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>	Would it not be better to work through UKRDA?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>		Question of visibility of UKRDA in England and Scotland</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>	Would leagues be interested</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>		imposing rules means people will refuse to join if they don't like the rules</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>	Community focus?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>		More communication as a community more valuable than a "Governing Body"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>		"Wee Blethers"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>		Extend what we do with Scheduling etc, more communication, used Scottish Derby Group more. Shared RESOURCES more important than Body.</p>
