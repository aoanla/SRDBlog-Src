<html><body><p>As promised last week, we have a special final edition of the SRD "Upcoming Bouts" posts for this year.

There's really not much happening for the rest of the year, although Chicks in Bowls Scotland are hosting the <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1864061217214459/">Skatemanay skate night</a></strong> on the 30th December, as even most of Europe is in recess for the Winter holidays... but things will be getting up and going very quickly in January, with a host of exciting events already up and advertised. So, this edition will be quickly summarising some of the first things happening in 2017... including some things which aren't bouts.

We've probably missed things here, so do let us know of anything we should add to this list!
