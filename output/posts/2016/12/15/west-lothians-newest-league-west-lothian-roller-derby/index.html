<p>We've covered quite a few new leagues in Scotland recently, and to our knowledge, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/westlothianrollerderby/">West Lothian Roller Derby</a> are the last of the list (although they were one of the first to appear this year).</p>
<p>Based in, well, West Lothian, the league is really just getting off the ground - and has a call out for support from anyone who can help them with costs and equipment.</p>
<p>We caught up with founder, Samantha "Queen C" Carruthers,  to ask her where the idea came from for the league, and where they were on the journey at present:</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-12808 aligncenter" src="../../../../../2016/12/westlothiantmp.jpg" alt="westlothiantmp" width="404" height="404"></p>
<p><strong>So, where did the idea come from for the league?</strong></p>
<p>"Well that's easy! My idea came from my passion for derby and the fact I'm studying business management. I can see the potential for an amazing team, who will be a charity/not-for-profit organisation. I want to bring communities together through roller derby and have had a really good response from communities who I have spoke to about this.</p>
<p>The obvious issues have been getting funds for kit together, we are still struggling but I have no doubt this will come together. At the moment, we are still getting our name out there and trying to get people interested! We have had a lot of interest in a junior team, so we will have a junior and senior league! We aim to be training for the end of January</p>
<p>We've had loads of interest, more than 30 people wanting to start. So kit is a very very big issue."</p>
