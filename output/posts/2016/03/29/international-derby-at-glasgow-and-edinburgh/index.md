<html><body><p>The Scottish Roller Derby season is hotting up, and that means more International fixtures to add to your diary.
As well as <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/03/23/international-roller-derby-in-the-forth-valley/">Fierce Valley Roller Girls taking on the cream of Swiss Derby</a></strong>, both Auld Reekie Roller Girls and Glasgow Roller Derby have international bouts planned for the next few weeks.

First up, <a href="http://arrg.co.uk/arrg-v-dublin/"><strong>this weekend</strong></a> sees Auld Reekie Roller Girls' All-Stars take on Ireland's Dublin Roller Derby, for the first time. Dublin are the highest rated team in Ireland, and previously defeated ARRG's B team (back when they were called the Cannon Belles).
This bout is a change of the usual for ARRG in another sense, too, as it is scheduled for an evening timeslot, beginning at <strong>17:10, </strong>in their usual venue, <strong><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Meadowbank+Sports+Centre/@55.9567319,-3.160204,16.61z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4887b86eb150070f:0x6955a8c9b9a10cc5">Meadowbank Stadium</a></strong>.
<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/predictortool/q/5912/7775">FlatTrackStats</a></strong> predicts a fairly strong win for the Edinburgh team, with a 1:2 score ratio. Auld Reekie will be wanting to keep FTS true for this one, as their momentum after defeating a very strong Newcastle Roller Girls earlier this year is strong.

A few weeks later, <strong>April 23rd</strong>, <strong>midday</strong>, Glasgow Roller Derby's Irn Bruisers are playing their first home International of the season (having been abroad themselves already, at European Smackdown). <a href="http://www.glasgowrollerderby.com/events-calendar/2016/4/30/irn-bruisers-vs-berlin-rollergirls"><strong>In their first bout in a new venue</strong></a>, <strong><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Glasgow+Club+Bellahouston/@55.8470224,-4.3307299,14.97z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4888461a8453bc9f:0xb647f258023c5070">Glasgow Club Bellahouston</a></strong> , the Bruisers will be taking on Bear City Roller Derby's Berlin Bombshells. The two teams have faced off several times before, but this will be a particularly unpredictable contest; Glasgow's roster has changed a lot from last year, and Berlin have lost their star double-thread, Master Blaster, to London.
<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/predictortool/q/7929/7734">FlatTrackStats</a></strong> predicts a win for the away team, with a 17:10 score ratio in Berlin's favour. However, while Glasgow have played enough games this season for FTS to have a handle on their current strength, Berlin have no bouts on record this season.

This event will also be a double-header, with a "newbies" bout as warm-up to the main event. New skaters from Glasgow, as well as Auld Reekie, Ayrshire Roller Derby, Granite City Roller Derby, and more, will be forming two mash-up teams, to get experience on track. This is an ideal opportunity to see the next Scottish roller derby stars as they begin their journey in public competition.
For those who feel inspired to give Roller Derby a try themselves afterward, Glasgow are also hosting a <strong><a href="http://www.glasgowrollerderby.com/events-calendar/2016/3/19/oeu1rzh6k77jmbol8c5xofw0cwnsel">Recruitment event</a></strong> the very next day, <strong>April 24th</strong>., at <strong><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Glasgow+Club+Drumoyne/@55.8597633,-4.334637,15.48z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x488845fd9321ec39:0xcf01f9e4e5ae65e0">Glasgow Club Drumoyne</a></strong> from <strong>12:30</strong>.</p></body></html>
