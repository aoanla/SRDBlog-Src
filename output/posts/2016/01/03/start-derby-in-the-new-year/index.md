<html><body><p>It's a New Year, and one resolution that you might have made is to Try Roller Derby. Certainly, many leagues across the country traditionally run a fresh meat recruitment in January or early February just to take advantage of any newly enthused skaters.

This year, there's a good distribution of Fresh Meat sessions:

First up, and a bit urgent for those who want to be involved - <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/750196985110434/">Glasgow Roller Derby</a></strong> are holding their Fresh Meat session on <strong>Sunday 10th January</strong> - just a week away! You'll need your own skates and pads to take part, and of course GRD recommend <a href="http://www.5thblockerskates.co.uk/">5th Blocker Skates</a> to get you the right kit. The initial signup session will be held at <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Glasgow-Club-Drumoyne/190810237616343">Glasgow Club Drumoyne</a>, </strong>and entry is free for the first session.

Next up in time, Edinburgh's <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1652424528374019/">Auld Reekie Roller Girls</a></strong> are holding their Fresh Meat session a week later on <strong>Sunday 17th January</strong>. You only need to a mouthguard to attend their session, for hygiene reasons; ARRG will supply kit for the initial tryout session. The initial sesson, and all subsequent training is at the<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jack-Kane-Sports-Centre/152896351412178"> Jack Kane Centre</a></strong>, and entry to the initial session is just £5.

Elgin's <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/168691136822816/">Helgin Roller Derby</a></strong> are holding a "learn to skate" session, co-hosted with Aberdeen's Granite City Roller Derby, on <strong>Saturday 30th January</strong>. As with ARRG, you'll need to bring a mouthguard, but other kit will be provided. The session will be held at <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Elgin-Community-Centre/286953997983978">Elgin Community Centre</a></strong>, and entry is free. This is a <em>co-ed</em> session.

Livingston's <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/636910396412245/">New Town Roller Girls</a></strong> have an extensive array of taster and meetup sessions across January and February. There's a chance to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/551015165051330/">Meet The Skaters</a> in a pub setting on <strong>Friday January 22nd</strong>, in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wetherspoons/105356126214627">Wetherspoons</a> in the Almondvale Centre . The actual taster session for would-be-skaters is on <strong>Saturday February 6th</strong>, in <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Blackburn-Community-Centre/298761240230260">Blackburn Community Centre</a></strong>. NTRG request that attendees message them before the event to allow arrangements to be made.

Back in the North, <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1732447053650457/">Inverness City Roller Derby</a></strong> are holding a fresh meat/beginners session on <strong>Wednesday 3rd February</strong>. Again, you'll need to bring a mouthguard, but some kit will be available (although you're advised to contact ICRD ahead of time with your shoe size). The initial session will be at <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Hilton-Community-Centre-918990224784740/">Hilton Community Centre</a></strong>; we have no information in entry fees, but the session is <em>co-ed,</em> as with Helgin.

Finally, for guys who want to play Derby in the Aberdeen area, <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1708084226107265/">Granite City Brawlermen</a></strong> are holding their intake on <strong>Saturday 6th February</strong>. You'll probably want to bring a mouthguard, but if you contact GCB ahead of time, they can arrange a loan of the rest of the kit. The session will be held at <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Aberdeen-Lads-Club-209093469130951/">Aberdeen Lads Club</a></strong>, there is no information on entry fees.

We also know that several other leagues are planning intakes in the next few months; we'll keep you informed as and when those are announced!</p></body></html>
