<html><body><p>With winter fast approaching, Edinburgh's <strong><a href="http://www.arrg.co.uk">Auld Reekie Roller Girls</a></strong> are not slowing down in their schedule one bit.

This weekend,<strong> October 22nd</strong>, Auld Reekie travel down to Newcastle to play the second "double fixture" of the month. On the 8th, ARRG A and B took on London B and C; this time, Auld Reekie's A and B teams <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1775971736017021/">will be playing their opposite numbers</a></strong> from British Champs Premier Tier Champions (2016), <strong><a href="http://www.newcastlerollergirls.org.uk/">Newcastle Roller Girls</a></strong>.

Our ranking scheme, <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/08/ranking-the-world-and-other-fts-visualisations/3">SRD Rank</a></strong>, places Auld Reekie's All-Stars and Newcastle's Canny Belters at very close rank indeed (107th and 101st in our international, cross-gender rankings, in fact), and <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/85476/rankings">Flat Track Stats</a></strong> agrees, giving Newcastle A just a 53% chance of winning using the larger European dataset.
The B bout might be a fraction safer for the home team - we rank the Whippin' Hinnies at 39 spots above ARRG B, and <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/85477/rankings">Flat Track Stats</a></strong> suggests that the hosts have an 87% probability of victory.

If you can make it down to Newcastle's<strong><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Walker+Activity+Dome/@54.968707,-1.5582607,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487e7068944e76d1:0xe1a6394d9f25325!8m2!3d54.968707!4d-1.556072"> Walker Activity Dome</a></strong>, then doors open at <strong>11:45am, </strong>tickets <strong>£10 for two</strong>,<strong> </strong> <strong><a href="http://www.newcastlerollergirls.org.uk/buy-tickets/22-oct-canny-belters-vs-arrg-a-whippin-hinnies-vs-arrg-b">online from the NRG website</a></strong>, and <strong>£7 each</strong> on the door (under 12s free).

Then, only a few weeks later, the All-Star Reserves will be playing again, this time hosting <strong><a href="http://www.granitecityrollerderby.co.uk/">Granite City Roller Derby</a></strong>'s Northern Fights on <strong>November 5th</strong> at their usual venue,<strong> <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Meadowbank+Sports+Centre/@55.956619,-3.1584973,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4887b86eb150070f:0x6955a8c9b9a10cc5!8m2!3d55.956619!4d-3.1563086">Meadowbank Stadium</a></strong>. The Fights, GCRD A, have had an exceptional year, topping the British Champs Local North tier and earning promotion to Tier 3 in 2017. (You can read more about their year <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/08/23/granite-citys-sparkling-year-peaks-with-glasgow-rematch/">here</a></strong>.)

Whilst Granite City will be looking to maintain their 14 month win streak, the Reserves will be keen to defend the honour of Edinburgh, after a narrow loss to Dundee earlier in the year.

The statistics are on Granite City's side - <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/08/ranking-the-world-and-other-fts-visualisations/3">SRD Rank</a></strong> places them more than 200 places above the Reserves, and <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/85859/rankings">FTS</a></strong> gives them a 88% probability of victory. However, Auld Reekie tend to dig especially deep when playing at home, so we're not going to rule out an upset, especially for their last bout of the season.
