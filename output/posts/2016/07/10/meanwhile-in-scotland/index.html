<p>Regular readers will have noticed that we've had something of a diversion from our regular content recently, as the second Men's Roller Derby World Cup, in Calgary, approaches.</p>
<p>However, exciting derby hasn't stopped in Scotland, or Europe, so we should catch up on what's coming more locally...</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-8166 aligncenter" src="../../../../../2016/07/12654276_631717886965980_4588037546842024195_n.jpg" alt="12654276_631717886965980_4588037546842024195_n" width="784" height="295"></p>
<p>For those who'd like a Roller Derby extravaganza a little closer than Calgary, or Las Vegas, this week sees the very first <a href="http://www.euroderbycon.com/">Euro Derby Con</a>, styling itself the "1st Annual European Roller Derby Convention". Organised by Track Advantage, the con will feature plenty of on-track action (including both sanctioned games and more eclectic challenge bouts), as well as off-track seminars and plenty of vendors in the shopping area. Euro Derby Con is in Barcelona, Spain from the <strong>14th</strong> to the <strong>17th</strong> of <strong>July</strong>.</p>
<p>We hope to have feedback and reports from this exciting event from attendees after it completes.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-8164 aligncenter" src="../../../../../2016/07/school-of-arrg-knocks5.jpg" alt="School-of-ARRG-Knocks5" width="608" height="430"></p>
<p>Even more locally, <a href="http://arrg.co.uk/">Auld Reekie Roller Girls</a> are holding their 5th "<strong><a href="http://arrg.co.uk/promotion/the-school-of-arrg-knocks-roller-derby-bootcamp-is-back/">School of ARRG Knocks</a></strong>" bootcamp on the <strong>16th</strong> and <strong>17th</strong>, now featuring both co-ed multitiered training (with slots for pre-mins, intermediate and advanced skaters), and a "Sur5al style" tournament on the Sunday afternoon. It seems that tickets are still available, at <strong><a href="http://soak5.bpt.me/">Brown Paper Tickets</a></strong> (be sure to pick the tier of ticket you want, there's quite a few options!).
ARRG also have their traditional Fringe events coming up soon, this time featuring a double header against Dundee Roller Girls and Glasgow Roller Derby. Check it out on <strong>August 6th</strong>, at the <strong><a href="http://arrg.co.uk/promotion/battle-of-scotland-festival-fringe-double-header/">event page here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Speaking of <a href="http://dundeerollergirls.wix.com/thedrg">Dundee Roller Girls</a>, they're also in the teaching zone, with their second "<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1696079833978398/">Open Learning Scrims</a></strong>" of the month, on <strong>Friday 15th</strong> at their usual venue of the Dundee International Sports Centre. And if you have the taste for bootcamps later on, look out for DRG's first ever Post-Mins bootcamp, "<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1769982133234846/">Skate Tay Victory</a></strong>" in September!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.glasgowrollerderby.com/">Glasgow Roller Derby</a> also have a busy <strong>August</strong> planned, following up their challenge against Auld Reekie above with a <strong><a href="http://www.glasgowrollerderby.com/events-calendar/2016/8/20/mixed-teams-double-header-vr-vs-soy-division-plus-science-vs-fantasy">double header exhibition extravaganza</a></strong> on the <strong>20th</strong>, which will see Soy Division (the UK's Vegan derby exhibition team) take on Vagine Regime UK (the UK's L(G)BT derby exhibition team), followed by a "Science v Fantasy" themed bout. Glasgow Roller Derby has quite a few skaters in both Soy Division and Vagine Regime UK, so this will be a pretty interesting bout to see...</p>
<p>...but Glasgow's next official bout will be the week after, as their B and C teams (the Maiden Grrders and Canny Gingers) travel all the way up to Aberdeen on the <strong>27th</strong> to take on <a href="http://www.granitecityrollerderby.co.uk/">Granite City Roller Derby</a>'s Northern Fights and Fight Hawks in <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1717081471898842/">another double header</a></strong>!</p>
<p>In the midst of all this excitement, we should also note that <a href="http://www.fvrg.co.uk/">Fierce Valley Roller Girls</a> are also not resting; with Preston Roller Girls hosting the last round of the <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/454153454770970/">British Championships Tier 3 North</a></strong>, FVRG will be taking on the hosts (and Dundee taking on Hallam Hellcats) to decide the final places on the <strong>17th</strong> of <strong>July</strong>. These are especially important games for both Scottish teams, in opposite directions: Fierce Valley need to win against Preston to move up from the bottom of the table, while a Dundee win against Hallam will give them a good shot at taking the <em>top</em> of the table from incumbents Manchester!</p>
<p>FVRG will be hosting themselves a month later, as <strong>18th August</strong> sees the return of their <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1385457658148117/">Charity Co-Ed Scrims</a></strong>.</p>
<p>That's all the derby we are aware of in July and August... but there's exciting things afoot in September as well!</p>
