The taster is designed to let new skaters try roller derby – with no commitment – to see if this is the sport for them. FVRG welcomes anyone aged 18 and over, no previous skating experience necessary.<span id="more-3116"></span>

During the session, participants will be buddied up with an experienced skater to learn the basics of skating (and stopping!) safely. Buddies will also loan their equipment for the taster. At the end of the session, the coaches will provide an overview of FVRG and what they do, and will answer any questions that anyone may have about roller derby.

New skaters will then be welcomed into a dedicated training program for beginners led by FVRG coaches. Once they progress through their training, regular assessments will be held to give the opportunity to climb the ranks into Intermediate, then Advanced training sessions.
