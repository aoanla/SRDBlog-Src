The Short Track Roller Derby events calendar is building for the year already, and there's a lot of things to talk about, so we're bringing you a new edition of the Short Track News roundup earlier than we expected to!

Our first development is that `Rolla Skate Club`_ now host a dedicated `Short Track Roller Derby Resources`_ page, with the rules and other info.
(We know that it's also set to gain more resources, too, as they're produced.)

In the USA, the biggest Short Track event upcoming is probably the `Rollercon`_ event series. Building on their appearance at the last Rollercon (the public debut of the ruleset, in fact),

Rollercon 2019 will feature multiple items:
  - "AA-level" Short Track Exhibition Game "Short Skirts versus Sleeves" (20 July, 20:45)
  - 2 MVP-pass holder on Skates sessions on Short Track with Rolla Skate Club [19 July 16:50, 20 Jul 18:00]
  - Open Track Scrimmage for Short Track (19 July, 20:00)

If you're at Rollercon from the 17th July, then we encourage you to go check it out!

Many other US and Canadian teams continue to use Short Track Roller Derby; Pittsburgh Short Track Roller Derby, in particular, continue to be a purely Short Track league, and are holding regular open training sessions.

In Canada, we know that `Nelson Killjoys`_ of British Columbia, will be hosting a tournament for 6 teams, at some point later this year.

In Alberta, Canada, `Fort McMurray Roller Derby`_ are planning to use short track rules for their home teams season, allowing them to support more home teams with their current roster. (Scheduled for around October 2019)
