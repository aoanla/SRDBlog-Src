<p>It's been a while since our last update on happenings with <a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com">Rolla Skate Club's</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com/short-track-roller-derby-resources/">Short Track Roller Derby</a> rules, so we thought it was overdue another post.
There are exciting things to write about, across the world, as well, so we'll break this up region by region!</p>
<div class="section" id="north-america">
<h2>North America</h2>
<p>What with Rolla Skate Club themselves being based in and around Vancouver, there's been a Short Track presence in Canada from literally the word "go". Rolla Skate Club events have</p>
<p>Later this month, Fort McMurray Roller Derby League, Alberta, will be taking their first steps into public Short Track events, with a triple-header home teams tournament all in one day! The league have been practising using Short Track rules for a while, and this is their chosen time to open it up for spectators.
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/437015853586543/">https://www.facebook.com/events/437015853586543/</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="latin-america">
<h2>Latin America</h2>
<p>In Argentina, as we <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/09/Vendaval_shorttrack/">reported</a> at the time, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/vendavalrd">Vendaval Roller Derby</a> hosted a Short Track demonstration and test as part of their anniversary bootcamp. For this event, the Short Track rules were translated into Spanish with the assistance o f
Vendaval + Latin America</p>

<div class="section" id="europe">
<h2>Europe</h2>
<p>Whilst we know there's Short Track in mainland Europe ( ), the two upcoming events we're aware of are both in the UK, and on the same day!</p>
<p>Following up on their successful Short Track Experiment, and the subsequent Short Track Scrimmage, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.allincrd.uk/">ALL IN: Community Roller Derby</a> are hosting a</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2311776749153059/">No / Low-contact Short Track</a> event, on the 20th October, in</p>
<p>this is aimed at providing newly mins-passed, or near-mins-passed skaters an easy and comfortable way to get Roller Derby experience.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, down in Worcester, the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/worcesterwyldlings/">Worcester Wyldlings</a> have been interested in Short Track almost from the start; and they're now ready to hold their first open event:</p>
<p>a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/428416294475681/">Short Track Scrimmage</a> , also on the 20th October, will be a combination introduction to the Short Track ruleset, and an open scrimmage with those rules. We know that there were quite a few people from the south of the UK who were unable to travel up to the ALL IN sessions, so this location will hopefully make the ruleset more accessible to them.</p>
<p>This scrimmage will be held at <em>Tudor Grange Academy, Worcester</em> , starting at 1500. Tickets are £5 a person, payable by paypal (via the event page linked), or in cash on the day. (Referees and NSOs are free!)</p>
<p>This is also a bit of a testing of the waters: The Wyldlings are interested in hosting a larger, mini-tournament later in the year, if this introductory scrimmage is a success.</p>

<div class="section" id="asia-and-the-middle-east">
<h2>Asia and the Middle East</h2>
<p>Short Track Roller Derby continues to develop in Asia and the Middle East:</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#uae-roller-derby">UAE Roller Derby</a> continue to train with both Short Track and WFTDA-rules, without modification to either; we're not sure how their open practice sessions, ongoing, work with regards to this.</p>
<p id="uae-roller-derby">OH Roller Derby (Korea's only Roller Derby league, based around the Osan Humphreys USAF base) have taken strongly to Short Track, and held several public and internal scrimmages with the ruleset. Their <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/475084760011429/">upcoming public game</a> on the <strong>19th October</strong> is played under Short Track rules. (This is a suitably spooky-themed event for close to Halloween, and has a Monsters versus Aliens team theming.)</p>
<p>This is not standard Short Track Rules - OH modify the ruleset because of a desire to let their skaters more easily play WFTDA rules when they transfer away.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="africa">
<h2>Africa</h2>
<p>Over the past year, both Durban Roller Derby and Cape Town Rollergirls have found Short Track rules to be a useful addition to their toolset when planning public games.</p>
<p>On <em>October 19th</em>, Cape Town will hold their third such event, as always paired with a Roller Disco.</p>
<p>Short Track helps both Durban and Cape Town to hold more events, with its smaller roster sizes and reduced officiating requirements; but the shorter duration and lower complexity of the game have also helped engage spectators. (Plus, having a 30 minute game before a Roller Disco means that most people will turn up that 30 minutes early to see the entire game.)</p>
