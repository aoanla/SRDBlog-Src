<p>Derby Stance Online Coaching Summit is back again for 2019!
Save the Date – November 22- 24, 2019.</p>
<p>Rule 56 is a Yorkshire-based roller derby coaching business that aims to bring together coaches and resources for roller derby, with a view to making coaching support more accessible to coaches, no matter where they are in the world, nor how big or small the league.  Over the past 3 years Rule 56 has been providing coaching resources, running coaching events, and making spaces for coaches to talk about coaching in roller derby.</p>
<p>What’s Derby Stance online?</p>
<p>According to Hydra of Rule 56, Derby Stance is “a virtual space for coaches to come together, meet up, share stories, and learn from some of the best sport and roller derby coaching minds.</p>
<p>This year’s Derby Stance promises to be even more engaging than 2018, with the addition of virtual workshops and round tables to encourage more participant engagement and build a buzz around coaching.  This plus the already thriving online Derby Stance Coaching Community will bring the feel of an in-person event into living rooms across the world.</p>
<blockquote>
With simultaneous transcription of live sessions into multiple languages plus more options for watching sessions later, we’ll be able to reach more of the global derby community and make these resources available even wider.</blockquote>
<p>If you’re wondering how an all-online programme works, it’s elaborately simple.  The sessions take place in webinar format, for which attendees buy tickets.  While the sessions are live, attendees can raise questions, speak to the presenter and engage with each other.  For those who can’t attend the live broadcast or who like to slow things down and take more notes, “watch later” tickets are available to access the content again later.</p>
<p>There are over 15 sessions to choose from over 3 days from November 22 to November 24 2019, with a keynote by the Women’s Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA) on Thursday November 21st to kick it all off.   Attendees also get opportunities to participate in fringe events via the Derby Stance Coaching Community, including coffee dates and coaching tips via Facebook Live.</p>
<p>Tickets for the event are on sale now.  Seminars are available to buy individually or as a full weekend ticket.  Workshops and round tables have limited participant numbers and can be added on to any ticket.  Attendees can check out the online schedule for full details of all the sessions.  (International derby is hard, so Rule 56 has included a time zone cheat sheet for your convenience)</p>
<p>Your (drum roll please) speakers are:</p>
<p>Smarty Pants (Strong Athletic)
Squirrel Power (Monterey Bay Derby Dames)
Rosie Peacock (New Wheeled Order)
Devoida Mercy (Philly Roller Derby)
Furrrocious (Amsterdam Roller Derby)
Michelle Welton and Gie ‘uppercase’ Carr (Rose City Rollers)
Kaio-Kensi (Montreal Roller Derby)
Dr. Astrid Coxon (Suffolk Roller Derby)
Jennifer B Gaskins (New Jax City Rollers)
Rita Giddens (Fort Myers Roller Derby)
Miss Tea Maven (Gotham Girls Roller Derby)</p>
<p>We’re proud to be able to thank the following sponsors who have committed to supporting the development of coaching in roller derby: WFTDA, Roller Dirty Soaps, and Steaks Contact Wear.</p>
<p>Comments from last year’s attendees:</p>
<p>I am super stoked to bring all the info to my league. It was WORTH it and I look forward to learning more in the future.</p>
<p>I just wanted to send a HUGE Thank you for the Roller Derby Coaching Summit. This is by far the most helpful coaching training I’ve received in five years in any online or local training event.</p>
<p>“It was mind blowing.”</p>
<p>We can’t wait to make Derby Stance 2019 an even better opportunity for learning!</p>
