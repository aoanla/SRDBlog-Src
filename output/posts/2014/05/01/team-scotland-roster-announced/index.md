<html><body><p>Team Scotland Roller Derby have just released the press release below, listing their World Cup Squad of 20 skaters representing Scotland at the next Blood and Thunder World Cup.

While understandably mostly Auld Reekie Roller Girls and Glasgow Roller Derby skaters, there is also representation from Aberdeen's Granite City Roller Girls and Dundee Roller Girls. London Rollergirls and the Seaside Sirens present one skater each to the roster.

Of the 20 skaters, 8 are veterans of the 2011 World Cup team (including London Rollergirls' Sarah Oates).

 

Team Scotland have also launched a fundraising website on GoGetFunding to raise money for the tournament. <a style="color:#3b5998;" href="http://gogetfunding.com/project/get-team-scotland-to-dallas" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">http://gogetfunding.com/project/get-team-scotland-to-dallas</a>
