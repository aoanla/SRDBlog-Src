<html><body><p style="text-align:justify;">On Saturday 17th August, <a title="FVRG Website" href="http://www.fvrg.co.uk" target="_blank">Fierce Valley Roller Girls</a> will be hosting a Fresh Meat taster session in Grangemouth Sports Complex to recruit new skaters into their roller derby league.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The taster session is designed to let you try roller derby - with no commitment - to see if this is the sport for you. You will be buddied up with an experienced skater to learn the basics. They will also loan you their equipment for the taster, so no need to buy any equipment just yet!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you’re hooked after this first session, FVRG will welcome you into a dedicated training program for beginners. Once you progress through your training, regular assessments will be held to give you the opportunity to climb the ranks into the Intermediate, then Advanced training sessions.</p>
