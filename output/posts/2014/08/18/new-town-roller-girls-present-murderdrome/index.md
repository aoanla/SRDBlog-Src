<html><body><p>On the 6th of September New Town Roller Girls play host to blood curdling display of roller derby as they put on showing of <em>'Murderdrome'. </em>An Australian slasher film with strong roots in roller derby and horror film culture that was released in Britain earlier in the year.</p><p>New Town Roller Girls were very lucky to have a member with a keen eye on Facebook who caught a post from '<em>Murderdrome</em>'  saying they were looking for leagues to show their film for fundraising events within their own leagues. The event is also going to be held at Livingston's key theatre Howden Park Centre who are very supportive of local groups.</p><p>The doors open at 7:45pm with the film starting at 8. Tickets will be £5 on the door and the event will be 18+ only and attendees will be provided with a NTRG wrist band.</p><p>The event also boasts a rich display of raffle prizes from roller derby paraphernalia to special deals with local restaurants.  <br> <br> To check out the event, the film and New Town Roller Girls head on over to; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/702042726509548/">NTRG present MURDERDROME</a></p><p><a href="/2014/08/poss-banner-murderdrome.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3600 size-full" src="/2014/08/poss-banner-murderdrome.jpg" alt="poss banner murderdrome" width="860" height="314"></a></p></body></html>
