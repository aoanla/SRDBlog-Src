<strong>If you think a week is a long time in politics – then you should try Mean City Roller Derby.</strong>
<p>Twelve months packed full of arrivals, departures, dramas, delights – not to mention changes, challenges and rule tweaks to keep everyone on their toe-stops.</p>
<p>Over the course of a year, skaters fall in and out of love with the sport, teams<a href="../../../../../2014/10/10665957_10204310510036958_302354271905941179_n.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-4405 alignright" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/10/10665957_10204310510036958_302354271905941179_n.jpg?w=300" alt="10665957_10204310510036958_302354271905941179_n" width="300" height="200"></a> fragment, others solidify, new techniques are introduced, heroes rise and dynasties fall.</p>
<p>Mean City Roller Derby (MCRD) can look back with pride, joy and determination on an action-packed 2014 which saw them win two public games, become the first co-ed league in the West of Scotland and come together as an unbreakable unit.</p>
<p><strong>Pride</strong> in the way the members have trained, played and been ambassadors for their sport.</p>
<p><strong>Joy</strong> in the vast improvements made throughout the league on and off track.</p>
<p><strong>Determination</strong> to keep improving on all fronts – playing more games, encouraging more women and men to join, and getting better and stronger as a team, as a league and as friends.</p>
<p>It’s been an astonishing 52 weeks for a league which took its first breath in 2012 – breaking new ground for men’s roller derby in Scotland - and has never looked back.</p>
<p>On 25 January 2014, Mean City joined with Bairn City Rollers to contest the very first public all-Scottish men’s roller derby league bout. The Skelpies took the scalps that day, but an unquenchable spirit was growing within Mean City, fostered by a new influx of skaters, trainers, supporters and officials.<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4406 alignright" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/10/1544391_10202472724133459_526197638_n.jpg?w=300" alt="1544391_10202472724133459_526197638_n" width="300" height="240"></p>
<p>It’s that spirit that has driven Mean City forward to make changes both on and off track during a momentous 2014.</p>
<p>May 10 saw Mean City travel down to the wonderful Barrow-in-Furness to play the equally-wonderful Infernos. The English lads lived up to their name as they gave Mean City a roasting hot reception – providing the Glasgow skaters with a lesson in walls, recycling and sizzling skills.</p>
<p>Despite the defeat, spirits remained high within Mean City, with a number of encouraging signs – more dedication at training, a willingness to learn and practise, and changes off the track to ensure the league was continuing to grow.</p>
<p>Next up for the ‘purple hearts’ was the Men’s Sur5al Tournament - hosted back down in Barrow by the Furness Firecrackers. A crack squad of skaters was assembled to take to the track against teams including Southern Discomfort, The Skateful Dead, The Inhuman League and Lincolnshire Rolling Thunder.</p>
<p>No-one really gave the Mean machine much of a sniff – so it was all the more amazing and satisfying when the City squad beat Southern Discomfort.</p>
<p>That’s right – Glasgow beat the best men’s derby team rolling in the UK. Okay it was one jam and under Sur5al conditions, but that matters not a jot – it’s not just the result, it’s the implication and the promise held therein.</p>
<p>Mean City Roller Derby was flying the flag for Scottish roller derby.</p>
<p>And they were doing it in style … by working, training and playing together.</p>
<p>Next up was an ambitious step for Mean City – on and off the track – a double header which would see MCRD host the mighty Teesside Skate Invaders in Glasgow.</p>
<p>The <strong>8-Bit Brawl</strong> also involved Glasgow Roller Derby’s newest travel team, the Cannie Gingers, who took on Fierce Valley Roller Girls – with FRVG claiming the bragging rights.</p>
<p>That double header was history in the making - the first time a double header had been organised to include teams from both Glasgow leagues.</p>
<p>Onlookers might have expected a modest improvement from MCRD – perhaps a close game and a typically-Scottish narrow defeat. But the onlookers didn’t realise that Mean City had been working harder than the Italian Stallion when he hit the Russian hills in Rocky IV.</p>
<p>There was nothing rocky about the solid walls employed agains<img class=" size-medium wp-image-4409 alignleft" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/10/10649861_10100265501092704_2057552521662314684_n.jpg?w=300" alt="10649861_10100265501092704_2057552521662314684_n" width="300" height="200">t Teesside and there was nowt ropey about the juking jammers who spun, ghosted and muscled their way through a tough team.</p>
<p>In the end, MCRD nabbed an historic 188-185 victory – their first public win – gloriously celebrated with Bench Manager Sara ‘Five Star Sylk’ McCann and their fans.</p>
<p>But the thrills and spills didn’t stop there – next up on 4 October 2014 was another double-header – this time featuring MCRD vs the Wirral Pack Animals and the Cannie Gingers against the Central Belters (from Bairn City Rollers).</p>
<p>If the onlookers didn’t fancy Mean City’s chances against the Skate Invaders then they gave them even less of a sniff against the fearsome Pack Animals – with their ferocious jammers and unyielding walls.</p>
<p>Said onlookers were soon left picking their jaws up at the floor (and portions of humble pie at the door) as Mean City bossed the game – skating out 163-136 winners.</p>
<p>That score doesn’t begin to tell the story of a team and a league who fought for every inch of track and for every one of their team-mates. It was an awesome performance and marked a real sea-change for Mean City.</p>
<p>But another sea change was about to take place behind the scenes. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4408 alignright" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/10/10253967_10204310520997232_7704960216960451892_n.jpg?w=300" alt="10253967_10204310520997232_7704960216960451892_n" width="300" height="240">There had been a growing feeling within the league that it was time to take a brave step into new territory.</p>
<p>Responding to demand – both from within and outwith the league – it was decided that Mean City Roller Derby would become co-ed. Members felt Mean City should help lead the way into a new future for the sport – a future involving people of all genders and all backgrounds.</p>
<p>The move was not done on the spur of the moment – it was a logical and heartfelt conclusion to months of thought, discussion and soul-searching.</p>
<p>So 2014 ends with a new dawn – as Mean City Roller Derby takes its first steps towards a future packed with promise, fresh challenges and enough thrills and spills to keep Glasgow – and our sport – rolling for a long time to come.</p>
<p>MCRD Chair Alan Muir said, “This has been an unforgettable and unprecedented year for Mean City – it’s amazing how far you can travel in just 12 months. We’ve organised two double-headers – winning both of our games – and taken the scalp of the mighty Southern Discomfort.</p>
<p>“Allied to that we took the momentous decision to offer a roller derby home to people of all genders and from all backgrounds. We believe as a co-ed league we offer people the chance to play derby in a fun, committed and competitive environment – helping the sport we love to thrive.</p>
<p>“We would be now<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4407 alignleft" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/10/1622202_10202472783574945_823268585_n.jpg?w=300" alt="1622202_10202472783574945_823268585_n" width="300" height="200">here without the support of everyone involved with Mean City –skating, supporting, officiating, refereeing or cheering us on – and our brothers and sisters on and off skates around Scotland and beyond.</p>
<p>“On behalf of MCRD I would like to extend a special thanks to all the referees and NSOs – and all the volunteers - who have helped to keep us within the boundaries and on track during 2014.”</p>
<p>What will 2015 hold and where will it take Mean City? In the absence of a TARDIS we’re all just gonna have to find out one game, one jam and one practice session at a time.</p>
<p>There’s an old saying that it’s the journey that’s important – not the destination.</p>
<p>Mean City would just make one amendment:</p>
<p><em>It’s also about the people who walk (or skate) with you and the awesome folks you meet along the way.</em></p>
