<html><body><p>Thursday the 11th of June saw <a title="Team Scotland Wesbsite" href="http://teamscotlandrollerderby.com/" target="_blank">Team Scotland </a>announce their new logo to the world on <a title="TS Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Team-Scotland-Roller-Derby/235701999922927" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.

After many months of deliberation and polls showcasing various themes and designs (A unicorn had been the leading idea in the beginning), they picked one and sent it off to be made into the snazzy form that you now see here.
