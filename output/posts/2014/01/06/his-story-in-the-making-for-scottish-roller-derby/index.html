<p><em> </em><strong>A guest post, written by journalist - and skater - Alan Muir.</strong></p>
<p>SPORTING history will be made this month when two teams of home-grown heroes go skate to skate on the roller derby track.</p>
<p>Glasgow's very own <a title="Mean City Roller Derby on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/MeanCityRollerDerby" target="_blank">Mean City Roller Derby</a> will be taking on Falkirk's <a title="Bairn City Rollers on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers" target="_blank">Bairn City Rollers</a> during an all-action bout in Grangemouth on Saturday, January 25. It will be the first time two men’s roller derby leagues in Scotland have gone head to head - with a rip-roaring day of reckoning in the offing. It's set to be a pulsating and punishing clash - showcasing a sensational sport which is sweeping Scotland.</p>
<p>Players from both leagues have been selected to represent their country's national team - <a title="Power of Scotland on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/PowerOfScotland" target="_blank">Power of Scotland</a> - at the <a title="MRDWC Website" href="http://mrdwc.com/" target="_blank">Men's Roller Derby World Cup</a> in Birmingham this March. And Mean City also boast two of the most experienced skaters currently playing roller derby - Jason Crawford and Jim Whyte - who together have played in more than 40 bouts.</p>
<p>Mean City are keen to start the New Year with a resounding victory over the Bairns' men's team - the Skelpies. Mean City Chairman and founder BruiseDog - aka Jason Crawford - said: "We're delighted to be helping to make history with our good friends and rivals from Bairn City Rollers. The Skelpies will be determined to get one over on Mean City, but we aim to beat the Bairns in their backyard. We hope our army of fans will be out in numbers for this very special, historic occasion. It promises to be an amazing advert for an awesome sport. Roller derby is fast-paced, skilful, athletic and all-action - offering a thrilling day out for all the family. Come and enjoy a sport that really has to be seen to be believed."</p>
<p>Captain and co-founder of the Skelpies, iHorror - aka Anthony Sweeney - said: "We can't wait to make history on January 25 and we want as many people are possible to come along and support their local team. Get your tickets now for what is sure to be a bruising, all-action bout. We will sell you a whole seat, but you won't need it - you'll be perched on the edge of it for the full 60 minutes."</p>
<p>Skelpies vs. Mean City takes place on Saturday, January 25, at 2.30pm in Grangemouth Sports Complex, Abbots Road, Grangemouth. Tickets cost just £4. Visit the <a title="Facebook Event" href="https://www.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers" target="_blank">Facebook Event</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Mean City Roller Derby - which formed in 2012 - is the first male league in the West of Scotland and is the brother league to the all-female, all-conquering Glasgow Roller Derby. If you would like to join Mean City - male or female - as long as you're over 18 and ready for a new challenge this is your chance. Visit their <a title="Mean City on Facebook" href="www.facebook.com/MeanCityRollerDerby" target="_blank">Facebook Page </a>for more information.</p>
<p>Bairn City Rollers are Scotland's first - and so far only - co-ed roller derby league, meaning they have male and female skaters.</p>
