<p>It would be remiss of us to run a series on Tournaments which deserve more attention without covering Scotland's own example of this.</p>
<p>Whilst there have been many tournaments run in Scotland, there have been relatively fewer "Men's Derby" focussed events. Given the lack of MRDA member leagues in Scotland until almost a year ago, when Granite City Brawlers were accepted, it was also impossible for there to have been any "officially" sanctioned tournaments at all.</p>
<p>Now, though, with two MRDA member teams (Glasgow Men's Roller Derby having quietly unofficially joined a few months ago, in June, although only officially announced by MRDA this week), the time is right for an international Men's Roller Derby tournament, and where better than the home of the first MRDA members in the country, Aberdeen.</p>
<p>The Silver City Cup - named for the poetic description of Aberdeen as the "Silver City, with the Golden Sands", possibly dating to an early guide to the city* - will host 6 teams from across Europe, in a group+placement format.</p>
<p>When we reported on the Men's European Cup, we noted that several of the teams involved were also facing each other in other MRDA sanctioned events this year. Conversely, the Silver City Cup seems to have attracted all the teams who aren't appearing as much elsewhere... so this is a great opportunity to see some matchups you can't get elsewhere.</p>

Within each group of 3, the teams will play round-robin (3 games per group), to produce a final group-ranking.
The 1st place winners in each group will play each other for Tournament 1st Place, whilst the 2nd places in each group will play for overall Tournament 3rd, and the bottom teams in each group will play for Tournament 5th.
<p>Looking at Flat Track Stats' "MRDA" ratings (which are derived only from MRDA sanctioned games played by teams), there's a pretty wide spread in predicted strength across the groups - second-highest-rated contenders, DCCLM's Kamiquadz are expected to beat lowest-rated contenders, Super Smash Brollers, by around a three-to-one points ratio! Ironically, the hosts have given themselves the harder of the two groups, based on prediction: they will be playing FTS' 1st and 3rd ranked teams of the tournament, as FTS' 4th ranked team themselves. In order to achieve their "rightful" position, they'd need to defeat the fearsome SWS in their group, before taking on the 2nd place team from Group 2.</p>
<p>Looking at pure history, rather than ratings, the Kamiquadz are really the wildcards here. Most of their past bouts on record are, understandably, given the geography, against French men's teams, or teams from nearby Barcelona in Spain. As far as we can tell from their FTS record, the Kamiquadz have never played outside of mainland Europe before, so this will be a big change for them - the weather in Aberdeen will be a bit of a change to Montpellier! On the basis of their performances in France, however, we have no hesitation in considering them the favourites to take the 1st place in this tournament overall.</p>
<p>Only slightly less of an historical wildcard for the other teams, Tampere Rollin Bros actually did play the Kamiquadz - way back in 2015 - but also have a more extensive set of travel experiences under their belts (being based in Finland forces that upon you, to some extent). In recent years, Tampere's bouts have not been MRDA-sanctioned (according to FTS), and so have not factored into their estimated strength*** - we'd actually say Tampere are somewhat overranked at present, going by their performance in their last tournament in 2017. [On the other hand, that tournament was in Barcelona, one of the most distant places Tampere have played, so it almost certainly represents a lowest bound on their expected strength at the time.]
The SRDRank ratings, which do include those games from 2017, tend to agree, placing Tampere in the same "closely-competitive" group as the rest of the field excluding KamiQuads and SWS.</p>
<p>Of the UK based teams, Wales's South Wales Silures have had the strongest, year to date, although far from the busiest. Despite losing 2 of their three games in May (to Manneken Beasts, and, by 2 points only!, Gothenburg Salty Seamen), their incredibly strong first game performance against the Crash Test Brummies has kept their overall performance estimate high.</p>
<p>The aforementioned Brummies have, along with Nottingham's Super Smash Brollers, been extremely busy this year - with fixtures in British Champs MRDA-side (Tier 1 for the Brummies, and 2 for the Brollers) at the start of the year, and MRDA Qualifiers for the Super Smash Brollers as well. Fittingly, perhaps, the most recent bout for the two teams to date is against each other, a narrowish win for the higher-rated Brummies (162 to 199). The two teams will get to repeat that match-up again in their Group 2 bouts, almost certainly deciding which plays for 3rd and which for 5th overall in the tournament.</p>
<p>Finally, the hosts, Granite City Brawlers, have been stepping on the gas in terms of bout scheduling since getting MRDA membership - meeting the activity requirements to be ranked in the official rankings is a strong incentive for all members of official governing bodies. They, also, have played one of the other contenders most recently: a repeat matchup with the Super Smash Brollers resulting in a second win in a row for the Aberdeen team. FTS's MRDA rating for them, based on their past 4 games, is still trending upward, but it's not clear if it is "really" above the 700-odd mark needed to beat the Silures in their group - however, if Tampere really is as overranked as we think, the Brawlers may only need to be slightly stronger than they're currently rated to be to take their groups' 2nd place spot, and play for a likely 3rd overall.</p>

<span class="s1">We’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <span class="s2"><b><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">Flat Track Stats</a></b></span> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <b><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></b>.</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <b><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></b> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). (SRDRank also has recent WFTDA rankings, including the 31st June ranking, as well as SRDRank, and allows you to make predictions from them.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]</span></p>
(Note: we're especially likely to be missing items this week, as Facebook's response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal has resulted in them turning off large parts of the services we use to automatically collate events for this article. We don't think we've missed <i>too</i> much, but...)
<p>We're trying a new colour coding this week, to differentiate <span style="color:#800000;"><b>BOUTS</b></span> from <span style="color:#0000ff;"><b>RECRUITMENTS</b></span> and <span style="color:#993300;"><b>OPEN SCRIM</b></span>s, and <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>BOOTCAMP</strong></span>s.

<strong>Aberdeen, September 2018</strong> - Granite City Brawlers are making history with their very own MRDA sanctioned tournament called 'Silver City Cup'. Whilst MRDA has Champs and Playoffs, there has never been a sanctioned tournament held in Scotland. Granite City Brawlers, Super Smash Brollers, Crash Test Brummies, Kamiquadz, South Wales Silures and Tampere Rollin' Bros are all looking to take the inaugural 'Silver City Cup'. With the Brawlers hoping to make their mark in the MRDA rankings, we took some time to speak to GCB's Co-Captain, Pudz (Chris Mathieson) about the upcoming tournament.

<strong>Straight off the bat, tell us how this tournament came about?</strong>
<p><em>We joined the MRDA last September and as part of this the team is required to play 5 sanctioned games a year in order to gain ranking. The bigger teams can get their games quite easily in a tournament weekend through Champs and Playoffs, however there wasn’t much opportunity for the lower seeded teams. So we put our organisational heads together and decided to put on a tournament weekend for those below 40 or unranked in the MRDA. This allows 6 teams (including Brawlers) to gain 3 of their games in a single weekend!</em></p>
<p><strong>How does it feel to be able to host/create the first MRDA tournament in Scotland as well as it having quite the international flavour to it?</strong></p>
<p><em>We are over the moon at having 6 teams coming from 5 countries to our little tournament in Aberdeen. We even been working with some local bodies to promote the tournament and the city. VisitAberdeenshire have even put together a web portal (<a href="https://www.visitabdn.com/cp/silver-city-cup">https://www.visitabdn.com/cp/silver-city-cup</a>) full of information to help our tourist friends. A lot of people see Aberdeen as this grey city with not much going on but there is such a history to it! Three top things to check out on your visit would be Dunnottar Castle (for the Game of Thrones fans), Footdee (a small area of quirky houses, 5 minutes from the venue) and Slains Castle (the backdrop of our fab logo, you might even see one of the ghouls).</em></p>
<p><em>As for this being the first MRDA tournament in Scotland we are delighted to showcase to the rest of our international association just what Scotland has to offer and that we can put on one hell of a tournament!</em></p>
<p><strong>I think we all want to know, how do you think GCB will fair given the tough competitors and the grueling nature of a tournament?</strong></p>
<p><em>This is GCB’s first ever tournament and as such we’re going to need to bring our A game up against some tough opponents! With a few Scotland skaters at the helm, we have some tournament experience that will hopefully help the rest of the team prepare mentally and physically. We’ll be aiming for the win and to keep the Silver City Cup in the Silver City but every team has a good chance of taking that trophy home, the very nature of a tournament weekend is that anything could happen!</em></p>
<p><strong>You say you’ve been preparing for the tournament, how have you done this?</strong></p>
<p><em>Last month we hosted a double scrim with skaters from almost every league in Scotland. This allowed us to prepare for back to back games against some high level skaters.</em></p>
<p><em>We also have our weekly outdoor fitness sessions with Intrepid PT, these have worked doubly as both exercise and team bonding. Though its been a year and we all still hate burpees!</em></p>
<p><strong>Should the tournament fair well, could we be seeing an annual Silver City Cup?</strong></p>
<p><em>Ask me when its over! Maybe not an annual tournament in Aberdeen but we’d love to see a division two type structure appear within the MRDA as it continues to grow. Obviously our end goal is MRDA Champs but that’s a few years away yet!</em></p>
<p><strong>Any final words that you would like to share with us?</strong></p>
<p><em>We really want to put on a good tournament, representing all of Scotland and we’d love a big Scottish home crowd behind us – get your tickets now - <a href="https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/3446103"><strong>https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/3446103</strong></a></em></p>
<p>Some inspiring words from Granite City Brawlers own, Pudz. From the sounds of it, this will be an exciting weekend of roller derby so make sure you get your tickets and be a part of Scottish history on <strong>September 22-23 at the Beach Leisure Centre in Aberdeen</strong>!

This wasn't just a disorganised chat, of course: this was the first ever Roller Derby Conference for Scottish derby, on the model of the European "EROC". On the 7th of October 2017, the vast majority of active Scottish leagues were represented by pairs of delegates [and all but one of those who couldn't make it sent statements by proxy], actively engaged in process.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-24409 aligncenter" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-13-at-16-17-08.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-09-13 at 16.17.08" width="335" height="315"></p>
<p>Whilst the first Big Blether was the brainchild of Auld Reekie Roller Girls' Crazylegs and Skinner, and Glasgow Roller Derby's Head Referee, Candy Moho, it was also agreed that future convocations would pass the torch onto other leagues around the country, spreading the democratic work.</p>
<p>So, as it goes, the first volunteers to do the hard thing of repeating previous success were Glasgow's All-Gender league, Mean City Roller Derby. Very slightly more than a year later, their iteration of the conference, Big Blether 2, is coming to central Glasgow on the 20th October.</p>
<p>The principal task of a repeat convention is more nuanced than that of a first meeting. The first Big Blether did great things in generating conversation; in spreading knowledge [we personally enjoyed the group discussion elements, and how well they were orchestrated] and sharing problems. <em>More importantly</em>, it generated actions - foci for future progress and development, mutually agreed by all those present. (It also gained Scottish derby a little bit of publicity, via an article in Five On Five magazine).</p>
<p>The second Big Blether will have the equally hard task of looking at those actions, a year later, and seeing what has been done, what has not; correcting course, potentially, or pushing forward.</p>
<p>So, it might do us well to look at what actions the first Big Blether produced, across the multiple sessions it held (these were scheduled as pairs of parallel sessions, run as facilitated group discussions):</p>
<p>The session on <strong>Scottish Roller Derby Oversight</strong> spread some useful information (and quashed some misapprehensions) about the existing governance structures in Roller Derby. The action produced was to develop a "<strong>Scottish Derby Lobbying Group</strong>" to provide a unified voice for the Scottish community in representing our needs and desires to larger entities.
We followed up on this, and believe that at least some work was done towards this aim, but as yet there is no formal group.</p>
<p>The session on <strong>Game Scheduling</strong> produced some frank discussion between leagues about competition for resources; the low ratio of leagues to halls and fans (as well as to officials), the network effects which mean that smaller leagues can be accidentally outcompeted by older, more established clubs, and so on. The actions for this session were to more strongly adopt the shared <strong>Scottish Roller Derby Schedule</strong> for scheduling bouts and events (this common document is hosted on Google Docs, and made available via links in the Scottish Derby Facebook group) and to consider <strong>Sharing Fixtures with Other Leagues</strong>.
We've seen use of the Schedule increase significantly since the first Big Blether, and there have been a number of "shared fixtures", so we think these actions have been broadly successful.</p>
<p>The session on <strong>Officiating</strong> involved some extensive discussions about the widespread issues of officials recruitment and training (and respect within leagues). The action for this session was to promote more central training and learning opportunities for Officials (on and off skates) - a <strong>Ref School</strong> to be run by Glasgow Roller Derby - and for leagues to work towards giving their officials a more "cohesive identity" to form around and generally <strong>treat them as first class citizens</strong> of the sport.
The Glasgow Roller Derby Ref School has run a few sessions (and Dundee have continued to run their own series of Officiating bootcamps, extant before Big Blether); and the branding of several league's officials as their own "teams" seems to represent a start of the second action.</p>
<p>The session on <strong>Access to Scottish Derby</strong> revolved around the perennial issues of costs, access to halls and training certifications; as well as problems with providing kit, and burnout in "highly active" members of the community; and the less discussed issues with cultural homogeneity in derby. This session produced a lot of "personal actions" for leagues to <strong>Share More Resources</strong>, and investigate community Volunteering Schemes.
It's difficult to measure how well this has been progressed without hearing from all the leagues - so this will be a point of discussion in October!</p>
<p>The meeting as a whole also produced actions to produce and maintain a <strong>Scottish Roller Derby Ranking</strong>, which would enable a <strong>Scottish Roller Derby National Tournament</strong> or <strong>Scottish League or Championships</strong>.
These have progressed very slightly (there's an initial Scottish Derby Ranking derived from Flat Track Stats Europe ratings), but on the meat of the matter - an organised competitive structure - there's a lot of work to be done.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The second ever Big Blether will give those actioned a chance to report on their progress, as well as discussing any new topics which have developed in the past 12 months - since that year has seen three World Cups, a changing structure in other International Gameplay, and at least one new style of Roller Derby, we’re sure that there will be lots to talk about.</span></p>

<span class="s1">We’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <span class="s2"><b><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">Flat Track Stats</a></b></span> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <b><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></b>.</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <b><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></b> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). (SRDRank also has recent WFTDA rankings, including the 31st June ranking, as well as SRDRank, and allows you to make predictions from them.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]</span></p>
(Note: we're especially likely to be missing items this week, as Facebook's response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal has resulted in them turning off large parts of the services we use to automatically collate events for this article. We don't think we've missed <i>too</i> much, but...)
<p>We're trying a new colour coding this week, to differentiate <span style="color:#800000;"><b>BOUTS</b></span> from <span style="color:#0000ff;"><b>RECRUITMENTS</b></span> and <span style="color:#993300;"><b>OPEN SCRIM</b></span>s, and <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>BOOTCAMP</strong></span>s.

<span style="font-weight:400;">Readers of the blog will know that we like to call out important things in Roller Derby from around the World. Recently, we've been focussing somewhat on Latin America, given the mismatch between the sophistication and maturity of Roller Derby in the region, and its visibility in the worldwide, especially English-speaking, world.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If people are generally aware of the burgeoning Latin American Roller Derby world, it's  through Argentina's 2x4 Roller Derby and Sailor City Rollers [both in A Coruña this weekend], and the national teams in Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Chile, Argentina and Brazil... But even these people may not be aware that there has also been Roller Derby in other countries in Latin America for almost a decade!
</span></p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-27321 aligncenter" src="2018/08/uruguay_mapa.png" alt="Uruguay_mapa" width="329" height="353"> Image via CIA World Factbook, Wikipedia (Public Domain)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">
Uruguay, for example, sandwiched between Argentina and Brazil, might be a place you'd expect to find Roller Derby. For the last 7 years, this has been true, with the capital Montevideo, not far from Buenos Aires across the Rio de la Plata (which becomes the eponymous Uruguay River upstream), hosting its own team. Pájaros Pintados Roller Derby - also named for the country and river, as "Uruguay" is Guarani for "River of (painted) birds" - has represented the sport for the country at many Latin-America-wide events over the last 7 years.
Only recently, however, a second (as yet unnamed) league has split off from these originators, doubling the amount of Roller Derby in Uruguay at a stroke - and potentially changing everything for the sport here.</span></p>
<p>On this important time of change for Pájaros Pintados, and Uruguayan Roller Derby itself, we talked to Pájaros Pintados' The Game about her team, and the state of Roller Derby in the region:</p>
<p><strong>Starting at the beginning, how did Pajaros Pintados start?
</strong><strong>Your choice of league name suggests that you started out wanting to represent all of Uruguay…</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Río de los Pájaros Pintados is actually a “place”, named by Juan Díaz de Solís when he “discovered” Punta Gorda (which had been actually discovered a long time before by a group of indigenous people called Charrúas, but well, nice try). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But the name stuck as an Uruguayan symbol and appears in many songs and references as a manifestation of Uruguayan culture (</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP5Od1tSaRE"><span style="font-weight:400;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP5Od1tSaRE</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> , for example, might not be of your taste, is not completely my cup of tea either, but this is it).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Pájaros Pintados started (as with many leagues, especially the first ones in their countries) as a small group of people who liked each other, and liked skating, and also happened to like Roller Derby, but had absolutely no idea on how to pull that off.
We started looking for advice, and many Argentinian teams helped us with the basics. We also started learning how to work together in terms of managing a Roller Derby team. This took many years and is still being revised, obviously.
But it kinda worked. So here we are.</span></p>
<p><strong>Since 2011, Pajaros Pintados Roller Derby have been the only roller derby league in Uruguay. Although Montevideo is not impossibly far from Buenos Aires in Argentina, it must have been pretty lonely, in a sense?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Oh yeah. Lonely as in splitting two teams (this usually left people tired as player rotation was not much of an option), naming them and pretending we were rivals.
Like, almost wrestling rivals. To make it funnier.
Every time we went to a tournament, it was like a birthday party.</span></p>
<p>We have been trying to encourage other groups to get together in other parts of the country with no success, to date. This is why this moment [the splitting of Pájaros Pintados] is so important in terms of Uruguayan Roller Derby history. It is huge. This is the first time we have two teams, as a result of the splitting with part of the competitive team.
This splitting, which was merely to guarantee performance for a part of the team who felt the need to train in other conditions, was something refreshing, as we have a sort of "rival" for the first time.
We are no longer training together, so we stop keeping track of what the others can do. We have different concepts on training and playing: huge for strategy. And, even though the break up was painful for both parts, in terms of not skating together anymore, I think I can say we all have our heads set up for roller derby, in general, and progressing as a country altogether. This will make us unstoppable!</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-27319 aligncenter" src="2018/08/pajaros.jpg" alt="Pajaros" width="448" height="525"></p>
<p><strong>In a lot of places where there's little skating, kit can be hard to come by. Has this been a problem for the league in Uruguay? What other issues have you had making Roller Derby happen in Montevideo?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is one of the main problems for Pájaros Pintados. The equipment is really expensive and really hard to ship. I mean, it would not be so difficult if we only allowed young people who know a lot about buying on the web and also can afford them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But we really want this to be a social change and that means to widen our attendance. We try and lend our own skates to beginners, but usually that gets complicated because to do that we require our skaters to attend a double shift (they bring the skates, stay for two hours, then train themselves). Most freshies leave when they have to make the choice whether buying the equipment or not, or postpone training till they got their own skates. That means we lose people all the time over equipment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Also, the training spots. This is the biggest problem at the moment. We are not yet fully supported by our community, as no one knows the sport exists, and when they know, they don't want us to scratch the floors with our wheels, among many other problems. Thing is, there are not so many places that fulfil the needs of a derby track, and we recently lost one. We are doing our very best, and finding some quick solutions, but this is not a new problem for the league.
We practice now at a venue which is significantly smaller than a (full size) derby track. So we focus on technique. We get by. We can get very creative. But it is a problem for our team, not being able to practice on at least 80% sized tracks. </span></p>
<p><strong>Pajaros Pintados started out with their name in English (Painted Birds), and rebranded later on. Can we talk a bit about why you made this choice; do you feel that there's "Spanish-speaking" Roller Derby culture that needs to be represented?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I think that was originally for practical reasons.
When we tried to explain our soon to be skaters or public in general what we did, which is by itself hard to understand, they asked “what was the name of your team, again?” And we ourselves did not pronounce it very well, not most of us. So after the fourth “what? Printerbers?” (yes, that is how a standard Uruguayan person would pronounce it) we decided to go with Pájaros Pintados. This was actually a success, but we secretly call our team “Las Printer” and encourage ourselves with “printer pride”.
Of course, since we made this change, we have also felt more honest about our origins, and now every time we say “Pájaros Pintados” to non-derby Uruguayan people, we can notice the pride in their eyes. I mean, it’s not bad nationalism, being such a small country right? RIGHT? </span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">No, but seriously: it has given the team a new meaning, a more relatable meaning. Accessibility, my favourite word, is one of the things we always wanted the most and still fight for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But, indeed, there is a Spanish derby culture. Names of techniques are being translated locally, and names of plays. People do scream “miren ese apex [jump</span><span style="font-weight:400;">]</span><span style="font-weight:400;">!” [<em>Look at that apex jump!</em>] but also “no te dejes agarrar de cabra!” [<em>Don't let yourself get grabbed as a goat!</em>]. Spanish-speaking culture, and more importantly, <em>Latin American culture</em>, has always been a thing, just due to history. Add Roller Derby to the mix, this powerful feminist, LGBTI rights supporting, sport, and we have the fight of all times.
We are powerful, we are determined, we are proud. </span></p>
<p><strong>Despite being alone in Uruguay, the Pájaros Pintados have been to a lot of big events - including several of 2x4 Roller Derby's Torneo Violentango, and Sailor City Rollers' Piratas En El Asfalto tournaments. What have been your high points as a team, competitively?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Well, we won our debut tournament in Cat C in the Piratas En El Asfalto tournament [in 2014?]! We sometimes think that, even with that exact same team, we wouldn’t have won it in 2018 as the level (luckily) is always getting higher and harder. But truth is, we did, and brought a Cup home.
We did not expect to win. We were there for the fun. And we won.</span></p>
<p>This totally unexpected win gave us courage to sign up for Cat B, which we have since played and have never won a match on. We won a third place later with a C debutant team, which is also a nice thing to mention.
But I think most of my partners will agree: the fun, every time we got a lead jammer, every time we played focused and together, every time we made the impossible… that’s the highlight. Being cheered by, best case scenario, 10 Uruguayan people who had managed to get there, and some friends we made along the way.
The times we felt challenged.
The people we met.
Simply getting to a tournament in another country by sheer stubbornness. That’s the most rewarding feeling. Doing what you really love.</p>
<p><strong>Let's talk about the very recent history: now there are two leagues in Uruguay. Do you expect this to change Roller Derby in the country, in terms of the possibility for more fixtures?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Well, we have the possibility of “a” fixture. Better than expected. That’s surely going to change things.
For instance… it’s expansion. That may mean more attendance: people have at least two options. Also, twice as many people who know that Roller Derby exists.</span></p>
<p>And, what we desired the most, someone to play against, without travelling, spending money. We are pretty optimistic about the whole thing. We are still getting used to it. But change is good. And we needed to change.</p>
<p><strong>How can people most help keep Roller Derby alive in Uruguay? What do you guys need?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Our main problem is to find a venue where we can host matches, and practicing with a real track. Unfortunately, that is in hands of fate and Uruguayan organisations.</span></p>
<p>So we would appreciate any donations and support. Our financial situation is still complicated due to the splitting (less skaters=less money). Any used or discarded but functional equipment might be lots of help, though we would have to check the customs laws first.
And obviously any support, like sharing, or even just liking, our social media pages is extremely welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Now that there are two Uruguayan leagues… what are the chances of a Team Uruguay at the next World Cup?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Wow... the question.
Well, we have a lot of things to fix, but we also have time.
With dedication, passion and some support, I like to think that’s a strong possibility. But we are still really naive about this thing in particular, even being this asked by many people we met on tournaments, on interviews... we are still kind of </span>lost.</p>
<p>So any information, guidelines, experience-sharing, help or whatever are very welcome.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <b><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></b> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts).

<p>Last year, we <a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/08/11/a-slavic-tournament-how-central-and-eastern-european-derby-exploded-in-just-3-years/"><strong>reported</strong></a> on the first ever "Slavic Roller Derby Tournament", a three team round-robin hosted by Warsaw Hellcats, and featuring St Petersburg's White Night Furies, and Prague City Roller Derby B in addition to the hosts. At the time, we noted that the mere possibility of this tournament existing was a signal for just how fast Roller Derby is expanding into Eastern Europe...</p>
<p>...and that expansion has continued into this year, so it is perhaps unsurprising that the tournament is back for a second year this October; bigger and more extensive.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-27274" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/08/slavic_map_out.png?w=2048" alt="SLAVIC_map_out" width="1024" height="650"> Competitors in Red, except the hosts (in Blue), and the three teams contributing to Team Czech (in Yellow). Men's Derby bout competitors in Black.</p>
<p>Poland have outdone expectations by doubling the number of contenders this time around, and extending the geographical inclusion to the southern Baltic states as well as Slavic nations. Fitting the resulting 6 team round robin into a single day is only possible with non-WFTDA rulesets (15 games would take 15 hours of WFTDA play, not including breaks), so this edition of the Slavic Tournament is being run as with Roller Derby Sevens rules. The reduced maximum roster size of Sevens also makes it more accessible for some of the newer competitors as an additional bonus.</p>
<p>In fact, this added accessibility has allowed several other firsts at this event:</p>
<p>Riga Roller Derby, representing Latvia, have previous bout experience, as part of the Team Baltic Roller Derby who competed against Team Israel at the 2018 Roller Derby World Cup - but have never played as a team themselves. Their Sevens team will therefore represent multiple firsts here: the first time Riga have competed as a team, and the first time <em>any</em> team from the (south) Baltics have competed in a ranked event!
This is very good timing, as the Baltics have just gained their third official league - in Tallinn, Estonia - this week, showing the work done in Riga and Tartu paying off.</p>
<p>Team Baltic is not the only connection to the Roller Derby World Cup, as Team Czech Roller Derby will be representing their country in Sevens form, with skaters from Prague's Prague City Roller Derby and Hard Breaking Dolls, joined by members of Roller Derby Brno. Brno's skaters on Team Czech will all be skating in their first public bouts at this tournament, giving them good experience to take back to their league. (We hope that next time Team Czech plays, they can also include skaters from the newly formed league in Ostravia, also announced this week!)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-27275" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/08/slavic_czech_map_out.png?w=2048" alt="SLAVIC_CZECH_map_out" width="1024" height="714"></p>
<p>Host country Poland will be exceptionally well represented, with not only hosts Warsaw Hellcats, and their fellow Warsaw team, Worst Warsaw, competing, but also Vratislavia (Wrocław)'s MadChix Roller Squad! All three teams have at least several games under their belt, and contributed skaters to Team Poland, (although Warsaw's teams are a lot more experienced!). Additionally, all are particularly used to Sevens tournaments, having competed in the 7th Heaven tournament in Poznań only a few months ago.</p>
<p>Also returning to the tournament from last time are the only bouting team in Russia, St Petersburg's White Night Furies; although they are sending their newer B team, Ingria Rollers, to compete this time around. The Furies also gained a lot of experience from their members in Team Russia at the World Cup this year (as well as their continued participation in the Pohjola Cup), so we're expecting a strong performance from their B Team here!</p>
<p>The restrictions of Sevens rostering make it difficult to predict the standings of the Slavic/Baltic tournament from FTS records (not least because several of these teams are playing for the first time!), but we'd be unsurprised by strong performances from the hosts, and the composite Czech team. Given the strong tournament experience gained by many of the competitors here in the past year, however, it's hard to rule anyone out.</p>
<p>In addition to the main event, this edition of the Slavic/Baltic Tournament will also be showcasing two other contests:</p>
<p>Another debut, this time in men's roller derby: Polish Men's Roller Derby, a collaboration of the Polish Eagles skaters based in Poland itself, play their first game on home soil, ever, against the might of London's Southern Discomfort B, Mild Discomfort!</p>
<p>And, finally, a chance to see another fantastic sport on wheels, as Warsaw's Wheelchair Rugby team present their sport in an exhibition game!</p>
<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2079168135665222/"><strong>first Slavic/Baltic Tournament</strong></a> will be held on the 20th October in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/XDcKWPs5wWN2"><strong>Centrum Sportu Wilanów</strong></a> in Warsaw, Poland.

<span class="s1">We’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <span class="s2"><b><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">Flat Track Stats</a></b></span> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <b><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></b>.</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <b><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></b> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). (SRDRank also has recent WFTDA rankings, including the 31st June ranking, as well as SRDRank, and allows you to make predictions from them.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]</span></p>
(Note: we're especially likely to be missing items this week, as Facebook's response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal has resulted in them turning off large parts of the services we use to automatically collate events for this article. We don't think we've missed <i>too</i> much, but...)
<p>We're trying a new colour coding this week, to differentiate <span style="color:#800000;"><b>BOUTS</b></span> from <span style="color:#0000ff;"><b>RECRUITMENTS</b></span> and <span style="color:#993300;"><b>OPEN SCRIM</b></span>s, and <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>BOOTCAMP</strong></span>s.

We look forward to the challenge, the team building and most importantly, skating on track with the Bonnie Colliders."<strong> - Megatron</strong> (<em>Mean City)</em>

<blockquote>"The Colliders are buzzed to be playing on their home turf! We have a strong team and have outlined strong focuses for each skater. New tactics for ourselves and new players coming into our team have us really excited for this game. Especially since we haven't had the chance to play the wonderful meanies yet!" <strong>- Tiny Tearaway</strong> <em>(Bonnie Colliders)</em>
