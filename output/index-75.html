<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is traditional, we’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"><span class="s2"><b>Flat Track Stats</b></span></a> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <strong><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/16-Dec-ranking.html"><span class="s2"><b>SRD Rank</b></span></a> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). Our new SRD Rank is out – the first for this year, and now includes Junior leagues where possible, and a lot more Latin American leagues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know!</span></p>

            </div>

<p></p>
<p>We've previously covered the first sets of new teams to appear before the 2018 World Cup in two articles - 5 of them in <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/12/22/new-nations-in-the-world-cup/">this roundup</a></strong> last year, and Team Iran <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/03/02/representing-the-middle-east-the-effort-to-build-team-iran/">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>But there are even more teams arriving on the scene for what will be the largest World Cup ever... and we're catching up with the rest of them in this series.</p>
<p>Our first subject is a Nation which is surprising, perhaps, for its previous absence: <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/rollerderbyteamaustria/">Austria</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17819" src="2017/04/teamaustria.png" alt="TeamAustria" width="1378" height="1378"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Whilst neighbouring Germany was one of the first European nations to gain Roller Derby leagues, and Team Germany having attended both previous World Cups, Derby in Austria has developed more slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For many years, the capital Vienna was the site of the only league in the country, </span><a href="http://www.viennarollerderby.org/"><b>Vienna Roller Derby</b></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, founded in 2011 (as Vienna Rollergirls). Vienna, whilst an active league, was not even a WFTDA member at the time of the 2014 World Cup, and so a Team Austria simply wasn't on the cards then...</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Team Austria's rep KnockOut Nora explains, "Even Vienna wasn't ready when the last World Cup came up (and it was 2014, its really such a long time ago already). And I think, no-one in Austria had even thought of the possibility of participating."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"Austria's just really slow when it comes to Derby, I think. Especially when you compare it to Germany, say, they have a Championship [the Bundesliga], there's 40 teams or more. Or if you compare it to France... </span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">In Austria, I think it's really quite a different situation, because we're just, even now, four teams." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Only much more recently, three more leagues, in </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/linzrollerderby/"><b>Linz</b></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (to the North) in 2015; and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/fearlessbruisers/"><b>Innsbruck</b></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (to the East) and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/dustcityrollers/"><b>Graz</b></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (to the South), in 2016, have formed, but the Roller Derby scene in Austria is very much still developing.  As with the Czech Republic, Poland and further East, it seems like it's more difficult to sell the game in Central and Eastern Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is a problem which Nora has also been thinking about: "Yeah, actually, I really don't know what it is - I started derby in the Netherlands originally, I skated there for 3 months, and, especially if I compare it to the Netherlands; there's also so many teams there, I think they're better connected; the people were so much more willing to travel, and everything was just closer. "</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"But I think in general, Austria might be a little slow with new things, and especially when it comes to derby, I mean, a sport for women and then people are kind of suspicious because there's no balls involved(!). I wish it were different! But I think things are really starting to change now - with the three newer teams, they're really really motivated, and I mean there's been so many [new] girls within the last one and a half years, so I think it's also maybe changing at the moment with Derby in Austria."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"And I also see the World Cup, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">participation</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> in the World Cup, as maybe a turning point ... to also make it more 'official' in Austria maybe. Because it's also something that people know, and that they can relate to a World Cup - it makes our sport sound more Official to some people." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"If I compare it to Vienna: the team is going on for more than 5 years now, we fill out every game, we have a huge fan crowd and we have an A and B team, Fearleaders, it's quite a thing already... and it's still really hard to get funding, and to get venues which are not city owned. And perhaps with National teams this will change, and they'll take it more seriously, and think 'this is a real sport, they play it in other nations, and other cities'... and I think that this is also what this Team means to me, actually, that it might create visibility for Roller Derby in Austria."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Especially with this World Cup projected to be the biggest yet, with (not yet confirmed) comfortably more teams attending than the 2014 World Cup, itself large with 30. It's hard to discount the relevance of a sporting event with quite so many nations involved...</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"Yeah, it's a big thing, and that's also something you can tell the people when you're applying for funding - this is really happening, it's a real thing, there's 40 nations coming, and it creates a little bit more seriousness to the sport then."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">To take part can also be a difficult thing in itself. The announcement that the 2018 Roller Derby World Cup would be held in Manchester was a catalyst for the formation of Team Austria. Whilst there was a chance that the Cup would be held far away for a third time running, there was no point in trying to form the team - why recruit if you won't be able to afford to travel?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"As soon as the decision was made that it would be in Manchester, I think this is the point where the people involved in planning - 12 people - we all knew that we could really make it happen.. and then we started to plan </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">for real</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Before then, it was always more like 'let's see what happens', because I think many people wouldn't have been able to afford flying to Australia, or South Africa, or South America... or anywhere except Europe! It would have been quite a financial disaster for most of my team!"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Team Austria have yet to hold their tryouts, and are hoping that when they do, they will be able to represent all of Austria, and Austrians outside the country as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"So, the thing is we haven't had our tryouts yet. The tryouts will take place in June - we are still looking for Skaters. Everything is still quite vague, we're 10-12 people who are planning in Vienna, and we're at the moment organising everything connected to the National Team. It's only Vienna skaters at the moment - the other leagues are busy with hosting their first bouts. We really hope that all of the leagues in Austria will be involved in the planning in the next few months."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"We will have two skaters from Munich coming to assess, along with our bench coach. We'll have a practice roster soon after tryouts, I think mid-of-July or something like that, and then the idea is that we practice together once a month until October/November, and then we will have our final roster cuts to 20 skaters."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">As with a lot of teams, especially this time around, the training team serves a dual purpose, and one which will hopefully benefit the newer teams contributing skaters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"The training roster is also to make it more inclusive, and to give people the chance to practice together, and to learn, and to really make the National Team a chance to help roller derby grow. And because, in Austria, the levels of the teams are actually still quite different, just because of age."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This kind of "community growth" effect from National Teams is perhaps one of the more socially important aspects of National organisation - and one which doesn't get as much press as it might do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"The people that are working on it now have been doing so since the announcement in December. But long before that, I've been to several EROC conferences, in 2013, and 2014, and since then I've been involved with other people from other national teams, and with the Roller Derby Nations Committee (for which I am the Austrian representative). So, I've been involved in that way, but the real planning part began in December, and I think for many people it got more real - we said, we have to decide right now, do we want this, because we don't have a lot of time, so we have to do this right now, or never."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">With Team Austria one of the newest teams at the World Cup, its aims are a naturally different from those nations turning for a third time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"I haven't actually thought about it [pauses]. It's not that easy - I can only speak for myself, but I think for many people it's the idea of having a National Team. Everyone I know who's into Derby watched the World Cup, and it's so fascinating to see all these people play. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And I think that many people, were then like 'ahh, I wish I could be there as well'."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"So I think the biggest motivation is to just actually be there for the first time, and also of course to play great games as a team which has grown within the last months of training. And maybe also to prove to ourselves, that while it took us a while to show up, that we did get there!"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Not, of course, that Austria will be content to simply 'participate' once they've arrived...</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"For us, judging from the people I know that applied, for the tryouts already, they are rather competitive, so I think once they are there, they will also want to win! We’re not sure what the final tournament will look like, but we’ll definitely be there to show Austria off well."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"But also I think that we will have quite some fans coming  - also because it is in Europe, it will be so much easier for friends and fans to come along!"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"I think that this also helps Derby grow in Europe as a whole - to have fans travel there. Sport is so much about fan culture as well, and this might also grow and become a bigger, more cohesive thing because people can actually go and see the World Cup."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"Not in a far away place, where you can still stream it, but it's not the same as being there, it's still kind of unreal."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Team Austria will be making things more real from their tryouts in July. You can find out more about Team Austria, and how to apply for those tryouts, at their Facebook page here:</span></p>

<p>Just as we did for Nantes' West Track Story last weekend, we thought it was only proper to do a quick rundown of the teams at 2x4 Roller Derby's WFTDA Recognised Tournament: <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TorneoViolentango/">Violentango 5</a></strong>.</p>
<p>As many of these teams are pretty new to WFTDA, they have no WFTDA Rank - most of them are playing a large number of WFTDA Strength Factor Challenges [a special kind of pseudo-Sanctioned bout which counts only towards the "new" teams' rating with WFTDA] in order to fix this. Buenos Aires Roller Derby is not a WFTDA member at all, and so does not have a WFTDA Rank. The advantage of Strength Factor Challenges is that they do not reduce the ranking of the "experienced" team - so all of 2x4's games at Violentango 5 are SFCs.</p>
<p>A full schedule, with time-zone adjustments and links to streams when available, is hosted on our site here: <strong><a href="https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/violentango5.html">https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/violentango5.html</a> (a smaller article on the tournament is <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/03/29/violentango-5-latin-americas-continental-tournament-returns/">HERE</a>. )</strong>
</p>
<h3>2x4 Roller Derby</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17687" src="2017/04/2x4.jpg" alt="2x4" width="200" height="196"><p>2x4 are the first WFTDA member league in Argentina. Founded in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 2010, they joined WFTDA fully at the start of 2016, at the beginning of the current trend.</p>
<p>2x4 has organised Violentango tournaments for the last 5 years, although this is the first WFTDA Recognised Tournament version. (We've written a little about the history <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/03/29/violentango-5-latin-americas-continental-tournament-returns/">HERE</a></strong>.)</p>
<p>As well as their A Team, Team OSOM, 2x4 also maintains a B Team (Las Pibas) and a C Team. After Violentango, Team OSOM are preparing for attending someone else's tournament, as they feature at <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1356059051113408/">The Big O</a></strong>, in Eugene, Oregon.</p>
<p>2x4 are rated <strong>#43</strong> by <strong><a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-march-31-2017/">WFTDA</a></strong>, <strong>#94</strong> by <strong><a href="https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Mar-ranking.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> (World, all gender) and <strong>#32</strong> by <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings">Flat Track Stats</a></strong> (WFTDA) [<a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Apr-ranking.html"><strong>New SRD Rank</strong> </a>- <strong>#111</strong>]
</p>
<h3>Sailor City Rollers</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17686" src="2017/04/sailorcity.png" alt="sailorcity" width="200" height="188"><p>The second team at Violentango based in Buenos Aires, Sailor City Rollers were founded in 2011, and (as is a theme) joined WFTDA fully in 2016.</p>
<p>Sailor City also have A, B and C teams, all of whom are active around Argentina and beyond. Most recently, Sailor City played 2x4 only a month ago, losing by around 70 points - they will be wanting to show that this was a fluke, given much closer games in the past (and a win at Violentango 4!).</p>
<p>Sailor City Rollers will also be at the WFTDA World Summit hosted by Rainy City Roller Derby on the 21st to 23rd April, as a "Scholarship league" selected to attend.</p>
<p>Sailor City are <strong>not rated</strong> by <strong><a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-march-31-2017/">WFTDA</a></strong>, <strong>#87</strong> by <strong><a href="https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Mar-ranking.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> (World, all gender) and <b>not rated</b> by <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings">Flat Track Stats</a></strong> (WFTDA) [<a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Apr-ranking.html"><strong>New SRD Rank</strong> </a>- <strong>#138</strong>]
</p>
<h3>Buenos Aires Roller Derby</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17681" src="2017/04/bard.jpg" alt="bard" width="200" height="205"><p>Buenos Aires Roller Derby, or B.A.R.D., is the third Buenos Aires based league at Buenos Aires. B.A.R.D. has a rather complex history, re-formed as the merger of the Cougar Rollers and Black Mambas in 2015; it could also be said to date back to the formation of the original teams in 2010!</p>
<p>B.A.R.D. have A, B and C teams, all of whom are active participants in the Latin American (especially Argentine) derby community. Of the teams at Violentango, B.A.R.D played Sailor City and Bx3 at the Third Latin American Tournament, losing to both.</p>
<p>B.A.R.D. are <strong>not rated</strong> by <strong><a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-march-31-2017/">WFTDA</a></strong>, <strong>#248</strong> by <strong><a href="https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Mar-ranking.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> (World, all gender) and <b>not rated</b> by <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings">Flat Track Stats</a></strong> (WFTDA) [<a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Apr-ranking.html"><strong>New SRD Rank</strong> </a>- <strong>#417</strong>]
</p>
<h3>Bogotá Bone Breakers</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17685" src="2017/04/bx3.jpg" alt="bx3" width="200" height="200"><p>The first of two teams from Colombia, Bogotá Bone Breakers were founded in 2009, but only became full WFTDA members in 2016.</p>
<p>Bx3 participate in the yearly Bogotá district tournament, which is also ongoing at the moment, along with the large number of other leagues in Bogotá. (Hosting of fixtures is shared amongst all participants.) Bx3's B team, the Baby Breakers, also play in the Distrital, as well as playing the lower rated teams in Colombia. At the Third Latin American Tournament, BX3 played Metropolitan (a loss by 1 pt), and took convincing wins against Ladies of Helltown and B.A.R.D.. They took a significant 670+ pt win over R'nRQueens B ("Queens") in the Distrital...</p>
<p>Bx3 are <strong>not rated</strong> by <strong><a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-march-31-2017/">WFTDA</a></strong>, <strong>#175</strong> by <strong><a href="https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Mar-ranking.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> (World, all gender) and <b>not rated</b> by <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings">Flat Track Stats</a></strong> (WFTDA) [<a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Apr-ranking.html"><strong>New SRD Rank</strong> </a>- <strong>#237</strong>]
</p>
<h3>Rock'n Roller Queens</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17683" src="2017/04/rocknroller.png" alt="rocknroller" width="200" height="200"><p>The second of the Bogotá, Colombia teams, Rock'n Roller Queens date from 2009, and are one of the earliest WFTDA members in this tournament, having been full members since 2013. (In fact, they are the first WFTDA member in Latin America.)</p>
<p>R'n R Queens have been very active in the development of Roller Derby in Colombia, having essentially gotten all of the "firsts" - the first bootcamp in 2011, the first tournament in 2012, and the first World Cup Qualifier in 2013. They are now active members of the Bogotá based "Distrital Torneo", as are Bogotá Bonebreakers above, along with their B-team (known simply as "Queens"), and brother-league, "Kings".</p>
<p>R'n R Queens are <strong>#177</strong> by <strong><a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-march-31-2017/">WFTDA</a></strong>, <strong>#289</strong> by <strong><a href="https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Mar-ranking.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> (World, all gender) and <b>not rated</b> by <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings">Flat Track Stats</a></strong> (WFTDA) [<a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Apr-ranking.html"><strong>New SRD Rank</strong> </a>- <strong>#341</strong>]
</p>
<h3>Metropolitan Roller Derby</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17684" src="2017/04/metropolitan-logo.jpg" alt="Metropolitan logo" width="200" height="150"><p>Santiago, Chile's Metropolitan Roller Derby are the only Chilean team at Violentango. In common with several teams here, they only became WFTDA members in 2016.</p>
<p>Metropolitan attend a large number of the tournaments organised in Latin America, as do their B-Team, the Bayonetas. (Most recently, the Bayonetas could be found at the Quad Wars tournament, competing with teams across the continent.) In the last year, Metropolitan have played BX3 (winning by 1 point!), and Sailor City (winning by more) at the Third Latin American Tournament.</p>
<p>Metropolitan are <strong>not rated</strong> by <strong><a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-march-31-2017/">WFTDA</a></strong>, <strong>#125</strong> by <strong><a href="https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Mar-ranking.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> (World, all gender) and <b>not rated</b> by <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings">Flat Track Stats</a></strong> (WFTDA) [<a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Apr-ranking.html"><strong>New SRD Rank</strong> </a>- <strong>#161</strong>]
</p>
<h3>Ladies of Helltown</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17680" src="2017/04/ladiesofhelltown.png" alt="ladiesofhelltown" width="200" height="200"><p>From São Paulo, Brasil, Ladies of Hell Town were founded back in 2009, but only joined WFTDA fully near the end of 2016.</p>
<p>As the first league to be founded in Brasil, the Ladies of Helltown have driven the development of  roller derby in the country. (Back in 2011, they arranged for Bonnie D Stroir to hold a bootcamp in São Paulo, and it has grown since then...) They have recently won the 2016 Brasilian Championship, and acquired their own permanent venue for 2017.</p>
<p>Ladies of Helltown are <strong>not rated</strong> by <strong><a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-march-31-2017/">WFTDA</a></strong>, <strong>#931</strong> by <strong><a href="https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Mar-ranking.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> (World, all gender) and <b>not rated</b> by <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings">Flat Track Stats</a></strong> (WFTDA) [<a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Apr-ranking.html"><strong>New SRD Rank</strong> </a>- <strong>#1008</strong>]
</p>
<h3>Gray City Rebels</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17682" src="2017/04/graycity.png" alt="graycity" width="200" height="201"><p>Also from São Paulo, Brasil, Gray City Rebels were founded in 2010, joining WFTDA fully only near the end of 2016. (The league like to note that, whilst they were the second league in São Paulo, after the Ladies of Helltown, they managed to be first to join WFTDA, if only by a few months.)</p>
<p>Gray City's travel team, The Humming, compete widely in the tournaments across Latin America. (Most recently, The Humming competed against Rio de Janeiro' Sugar Loathe - with a 206-64 victory, and "the rest of the World", a challenge team.)</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is traditional, we’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"><span class="s2"><b>Flat Track Stats</b></span></a> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <strong><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/16-Dec-ranking.html"><span class="s2"><b>SRD Rank</b></span></a> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). Our new SRD Rank is out – the first for this year, and now includes Junior leagues where possible, and a lot more Latin American leagues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know!</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Scotland</b></span></h3>

<p class="p2">Whilst three Scottish leagues are playing away this weekend, there's still derby in Scotland itself:</p>

<ul>
<li class="p2">On Sunday,  Perth sees Fair City Rollers return to play their first public bout in several years, against first-time-bouting Helgin Roller Derby (of Elgin). [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/88721/overview">FTS</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/254873508256762/">EVENT</a></strong>]</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">UK</h3>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As will be the case for the next few months, much of the bouts in the UK are part of British Champs:</span></p>

<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3">Sunday sees Dublin, Ireland (yes, we know, but we're covering British Champs in the UK section) see the next fixtures in the Tier 3 Men's North, hosts Men Behaving Derby playing Falkirk's Bairn City Rollers' Skelpies; Teeside Skate Invaders also play Glasgow Men's Roller Derby [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/88824/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/243337009463675/">EVENT</a></strong>]</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of Champs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>London sees the return of Anarchy in the UK (6), as London Rollergirls invite the top 5 WFTDA teams in Europe (Rainy City Roller Derby, Helsinki Roller Derby, Crime City Rollers, Stockholm Roller Derby and London themselves) to compete in Sanctioned bouts. [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/91888/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/101284667022793/">EVENT</a></b>] (FTS favours London, but there's some closely matched teams in the rest of the field...)</li>
    <li>Blackpool Roller Derby, after playing ARRG C last weekend, this time host Glasgow Roller Derby B down in Blackpool [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/node/91432">FTS</a></strong>], as a double header withThe Northern Rogues vs North Wales ZomBs [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/681819795336701/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS favours the visitors)</li>
    <li>Manchester Roller Derby are hosting a co-ed bout, with their "Furious Engine" against The World [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1767037766945624/">EVENT</a></strong>]</li>
    <li>Manchester also sees New Wheeled Order host Wirral Pack Animals in a closed door bout [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/92129/overview">FTS</a></strong>] (FTS can't predict this - but SRDRank favours NWO.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">Europe</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Europe, there’s rather a lot of derby, but all concentrated in a few places...</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">the French National Championships continue, with Division 2 hosted by Roller Derby Toulouse , with  Castres Roller Derby, Roller Derby Tarbes, SAM Roller Derby, Toulouse B,Roller Derby Pibrac, and Roller Derby La Rochelle all competing[<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/86044/overview">FTS</a></strong>]<b>[<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/260311604429303/">EVENT</a></b>]</li>
    <li class="p1">Metz, France sees the second big French tournament in as many weekends, as Roller Derby Metz Club host Fantastic 8 - a three day tournament featuring the hosts, Croydon Roller Derby, Roller Derby Dresden, Hell's Ass Derby Girls Strasbourg, Sheffield Steel Roller Girls, Dom City Dolls, Munich Rolling Rebels, and Rotterdam Roller Derby [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/92176/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1198179813643364/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS favours Croydon, Sheffield and Dresden)</li>
    <li class="p1">and up in northern Finland, the last bouts in this season of the Pohjola Cup are played, with hosts Oulu playing St Petersburg's White Night Furies, Jyväskylä playing Riverdale, and the White Night Furies playing Roll-On. [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/85241/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/174506423063447/">EVENT</a></strong>]</li>
    <li class="p1">Outside of the big tournaments, The Hague, Netherlands sees The Parliament of Pain host Go-Go Gent Roller Derby B (the Cubs) [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/node/90649">FTS</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1772678903011391/">EVENT</a></strong>] (The hosts have the advantage, according to FTS)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Pacific</b></span></h3>

<p>In Australia and New Zealand, it looks a bit quiet:
</p>
<ul>
<li>In Albany, Western Australia, Albany Roller Derby have their only fresh meat recruitment of the year [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1430052733683289/">EVENT</a></strong>]</li>

</ul>
<h3><span class="s1"><b>Latin America</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2">In Latin America... there's one very large event happening:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p2">From Thursday through Sunday, Buenos Aires, Argentina sees the first ever WFTDA Recognised Tournament in Latin America, as 2x4 Roller Derby presents the 5th Violentango. With fellow Latin American WFTDA leagues, Sailor City Rollers, Metropolitan Roller Derby, Gray City Rebels, Ladies of Helltown, Rock'N Roller Queens and Bogotá Bone Breakers; and nonWFTDA Buenos Aires Roller Derby (B.A.R.D.), the event will be a mix of SFC, Sanctioned and unsanctioned bouts, and include a bootcamp and a WFTDA Officiating Clinic! We have a schedule available for the event here [<strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/violentango5.html">SCHEDULE</a></strong>], which also links to our other writing on it.[<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/92143/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1394173553950337/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS can't predict this - SRD Rank favours Sailor City Rollers and hosts 2x4, depending on the strength of home team advantage.)</li>
    <li class="p2">Also: MDQueens host another "open skater intake" on Saturday.[<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/428808230788454/">EVENT</a></strong>]</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">Africa and Middle East</h3>

<p>Excitingly, we get to add another section to this update, as...
</p>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Cairo, Egypt sees the CaiRollers host their second bout ever (and their first "international") as they welcome the Marseille Bloody Skulls over to play.

<p>With Nantes Derby Girls' 5th edition of <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/629986423840264/">West Track Story</a></strong> coming up this weekend, we thought we'd make you a little guide to the teams competing in this WFTDA Recognised Tournament.</p>
<p>As the tournament is <strong><a href="https://wftda.com/events/wftda-recognized-tournaments/">WFTDA Recognised</a></strong>, each bout will be Sanctioned, contributing to the teams' ranking for the important "Playoffs" rankings which decide which Division you make, if any.</p>
<p>As the tournament is WFTDA Recognised, WFTDA.TV is re-streaming the video - if you'd like to check the schedule in your timezone, we have a viewing guide here: <strong><a href="https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/westtrackstory2017.html">https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/westtrackstory2017.html</a></strong></p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-17455 aligncenter" src="2017/04/wts5.jpg" alt="WTS5" width="526" height="276"></p>
<h4>Nantes Derby Girls</h4>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17407" src="2017/04/nantes.jpg" alt="nantes" width="200" height="200"><p>Hosts Nantes are one of the stronger teams in Europe - ranked 24th by Flat Track Stats. Founded in September 2010, Nantes became a member of the the FFRS (the French Roller Sports Governing Body) in 2012, and a WFTDA Apprentice in 2013, with full WFTDA membership the usual year later.
Nantes have been running West Track Story since 2013, when it had just 4 teams attending; it soon grew to a 5 team event, with WFTDA "Official" status coming in 2016 for West Track Story IV.</p>
<p>As well as West Track Story, which they have won 4 out of 5 times, Nantes also competes in the French National Championships, in the highest ("Elite") tier.</p>
<p>Nantes are currently ranked <strong>#144</strong> by <strong><a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-february-28-2017/">WFTDA</a></strong>, <strong>#155</strong> by <strong><a href="https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Mar-ranking.html">SRDRank</a> </strong>and<strong> #24 </strong>in<strong> <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings/europe">Europe(FTS)</a></strong>
</p>
<h4>Glasgow Roller Derby</h4>
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4717" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/glasgow_roller_derby_3_color_logo.png?w=185" alt="Glasgow_Roller_Derby_3_Color_Logo" width="185" height="300"><p>The first Roller Derby league in Scotland, GRD recently celebrated their 10th birthday, and we interviewed one of their founding members at the time. [<strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/03/04/10-years-of-roller-derby-in-glasgow-mistress-malicious-on-grds-10th/">READ MORE</a></strong>]. Glasgow have been full WFTDA members since 2012.</p>
<p>Back in 2015, Glasgow's B team attended West Track Story III, where they defeated Kallio B, but lost out to the Berlin B team and hosts Nantes narrowly, and to Amsterdam by a knife-edge (just 7 points).
Glasgow Roller Derby are the only team attending with a history of competing in both Europe and Internationally.
This year, it's Glasgow Roller Derby A attending, and they will be hoping to show that they're past their problems in the past year and back on track to start regaining WFTDA rank. In the past year, GRD have played none of the teams at West Track Story - although they played Gent way back in 2012, and won. Both teams have changed significantly since then, however!</p>
<p>Glasgow are currently ranked <strong>#195</strong> by <strong><a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-february-28-2017/">WFTDA</a></strong>, <strong>#307</strong> by <strong><a href="https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Mar-ranking.html">SRDRank</a> </strong>and<strong> #51 </strong>in<strong> <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings/europe">Europe(FTS)</a></strong>
</p>
<h4>GO-GO Gent Roller Derby</h4>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17411" src="2017/04/gent.png" alt="Gent" width="200" height="200"><p>The first Roller Derby league in Belgium, when they founded in late 2008 as "Gent Go-Go Roller Girls", the league rebranded to its current name in 2016. We miss the cats in their old logo. GO-GO Gent have been WFTDA members since 2012.</p>
<p>Gent host their own WFTDA Recognised European Tournament - A Skate Odyssey - since 2013, but this is the first time they've turned up at Nantes' event. As well as competing at SKOD each year, Gent play widely across Europe - in the past year, they played Dirty River, Nantes and Antwerp, all of whom managed to pull out wins. This time, Gent will be looking to show they can win, as they rebuild their ranking from 2015.</p>
<p>Gent are currently ranked <strong>#150</strong> by <strong><a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-february-28-2017/">WFTDA</a></strong>, <strong>#207</strong> by <strong><a href="https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Mar-ranking.html">SRDRank</a> </strong>and<strong> #33 </strong>in<strong> <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings/europe">Europe(FTS)</a></strong>
</p>
<h4>Dirty River Roller Derby</h4>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17414" src="2017/04/dirtyriver.jpg" alt="Dirtyriver" width="193" height="250"><p>Hailing from Turku, Finland, and founded in 2010, Dirty River Roller Derby are named (fairly obviously) for the locally famous state of the river Aura which passes through the city, although they changed their name from "Grrrls" to "Derby" in 2014. The league have been full WFTDA members since 2015.</p>
<p>As well as being strong competitors in the Finnish National Tournament (the Suomi Cup) since its founding (placing no lower than 4th in any year, and 2nd in 2015), Dirty River also compete across Europe, and played both Nantes and Gent in 2016 - losing to the former by only a pair of points, 215-213. Dirty River have been regular attendees at the (Gent-hosted) Skate Odyssey tournaments, but this is their first West Track Story.
</p>
<div class="clearfix _ikh _3-8j">Dirty River are currently ranked <strong>#145</strong> by <strong><a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-february-28-2017/">WFTDA</a></strong>, <strong>#206</strong> by <strong><a href="https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Mar-ranking.html">SRDRank</a> </strong>and<strong> #39 </strong>in<strong> <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings/europe">Europe(FTS)</a></strong>
</div>
<h4>Antwerp Roller Derby / One Love Roller Dolls</h4>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17417" src="2017/04/antwerp.jpg" alt="antwerp" width="200" height="114"><p>Antwerp Roller Derby, known better as One Love Roller Dolls, were founded in 2010, and joined WFTDA four years later in 2014.</p>
<p>Regular competitors (with Gent) at the Benelux region tournament, Skates of Glory (which One Love founded and host), One Love also compete across Europe. In the last year, they have played only Gent out of the competitors at West Track Story, beating them by just 6 points! One Love are currently on an upward trajectory in their rankings, and will be looking to continue that in this WFTDA Recognised tournament.</p>
<p>Antwerp are currently ranked <strong>#152</strong> by <strong><a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-february-28-2017/">WFTDA</a></strong>, <strong>#151</strong> by <strong><a href="https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/17-Mar-ranking.html">SRDRank</a> </strong>and<strong> #22 </strong>in<strong> <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings/europe">Europe(FTS)</a></strong></p>

<p></p>
<p>A lot of exciting things happen in Roller Derby without getting the attention they deserve.</p>
<p>One of these has been the <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Torneo-Brutal-709201495857174/">Torneo Brutal</a></strong>, a unique short-format-derby tournament which has been held by the Chilean leagues for the last few years.</p>
<p>We talked to organiser Lola Paranoia about the genesis of the tournament, and the currently completed Third Edition of it.</p>
<p>"In August 2015 was the first edition of the Torneo Brutal. The idea was copied from a similar tournament in Argentina, where a friend participated and told us the experience. At that time, we had little competition in the country, few leagues, so the format of the tournament seemed perfect."</p>
<p>Looking for a host, Vina del Mar's men's league - Tacones Bandidos - were most excited and agreed to be hosts for the first ever Torneo Brutal , and the two sequels so far!</p>
<p>Along the way, Lola's artist friend Picota, and Rambla and Mr. Sokram, joined the project as organisers.</p>
<p>The format is similar to the European "Derby Sevens", with 6-skater teams (plus a bench) playing 30 minute games, otherwise according to WFTDA/MRDA Rules. Like many Sevens tournaments, the teams are CoEd/Open-To-All (or "Roller Derby mixto"), which is also a more popular approach in Latin America in general, and are essentially "exhibition teams" created for each edition.</p>
<p>The third edition of the Tournament sees 11 teams compete in a single-elimination bracket, which is easily managed with the smaller format games.</p>
<p>The Teams - Zicod'lia, La Mafia Del Sur, Virutas, Mujeros, Emoticon Team, Cosmopolitan, Team Sexy, Cousins Power, Chalabota, Malbec Madness, and Jurassic Quad - draw skaters from across Chile, as well as across the border from Mendoza, Argentina.</p>
<p>An intense tournament resulted in a win for Emoticon Team over Viruta, with a narrow 119-94 scoreline, with Viruta finishing the 30 minutes with only 2 players on track. (The reduced starting roster means that Torneo Brutal does not have a minimum-roster to continue competing after injury or foul-outs.)

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is traditional, we’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"><span class="s2"><b>Flat Track Stats</b></span></a> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <strong><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/16-Dec-ranking.html"><span class="s2"><b>SRD Rank</b></span></a> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). Our new SRD Rank is out – the first for this year, and now includes Junior leagues where possible, and a lot more Latin American leagues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know!</span></p>
