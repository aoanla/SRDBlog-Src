<p><em>Recently, Kaiserslautern's Roller Girls of the Apocalypse underwent an extensive rebrand - not just the kind where you change a single noun, but a complete alteration of their league to "Kaiserslautern Roller Derby", along with a complete replacement of their league logo and colours!</em></p>
<p><em>We have been lucky enough to persuade KRD's Public Relations Chair, Felicity Fleet, to write up their thoughts on the rebranding process - and what it means to the league for us.</em></p>
<p><em>This article has also been hand translated by KRD's Lena Albert into German [available by clicking the Deutsch link in the left pane under "Scottish Roller Derby Blog"]!</em></p>
<p>My first roller derby boot camp as an assessed skater provided me with an understanding of the Roller Girls of the Apocalypse (RGA) brand in the wider European roller derby community. “Some years RGA is really good, and some years we wonder ‘what happened’?” a veteran German skater commented to me. This would become a familiar refrain as I began to travel and play with or against other teams. As a skater developed in RGA’s Fresh Meat program, I could easily answer “what happened”: A new skater with little experience, like me, replaced a veteran skater. And it’s no one’s fault. That’s what RGA is as a league.</p>
<p>RGA is a German league in Kaiserslautern with membership primarily from the surrounding American military community. If you don’t know much about the U.S. military, here’s a quick debrief: U.S. military members generally stay in one place for 2-4 years before they are required to move for their job. In 2018, RGA lost 13 skaters or officials to military moves. By the end of 2019, 12 more players will have left.</p>
<p>The consequence is that RGA serves as a great feeder league. We have sent well-trained skaters to top leagues in the USA, and we have trained a number of promising new skaters in our 6-month Fresh Meat program who are forced to take their potential elsewhere shortly after they pass assessments. During the years we see a large exodus of members, the role of our veteran players in the league changes from “valued player” to “valued trainer”. Our vets will spend most of their own training time helping newer members learn the game and gain skills, while losing their own ability to train at a higher level. Consequently, our veteran skaters play the next year or two at a lower competitive level than they are capable, since most of their teammates are new. Surrounding teams meet us on the track and ask “what happened?” to our level of play. Then the newer players become good players, the exodus begins, and the cycle continues.</p>
<p>Eventually, we had to question if this is a sustainable model for our league. We had to have some hard conversations and genuine self-reflection as we considered our brand in the community and what it means to be competitive.</p>

<p>We've written a bit about South African roller derby when covering their <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/10/31/south-africas-national-derby-fest-2018-three-years-of-festivals/">national tournament</a>, but there's a lot more to be said about the community than that.</p>
<p>Geography informs the way in which Roller Derby develops in a country, and South Africa's is very different to what we're used to in Europe.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Map of South Africa's Population density, with leagues marked." src="images/2019/06/southafrica-popdensity.png"><p class="caption">Map of South Africa's population density, with leagues marked. [Underlay: Htonl (Public domain, Wikipedia)]</p>
</div>
<p>South Africa is a large country - its area is about twice that of France - but with a relatively small population - about 80% that of France. And that population is very unevenly spread across the country: the dense province of <strong>Gauteng</strong>, containing Johannesburg and Pretoria, contains about a <em>quarter</em> of South Africa's entire population, with another fifth concentrated around Durban in the south-east province of <strong>KwaZulu-Natal</strong>, and a further eighth around Cape Town in the <strong>Western Cape</strong>.</p>
<p>Unlike in most European countries, then, the 4 leagues of South Africa - located in those 4 named cities - have difficulty even travelling to play each other on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Add to this the fact that the only other country with Roller Derby in Africa is <em>Egypt</em>, at the other end of the continent, and you can get a feel for how dedicated and unique the solutions adapted by the South African leagues have had to be.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll be discussing in some depth both those problems, and their solutions, so click on to read more:</p>

<p>This is the Sunday addendum edition of the highlights, for 16 June.</p>
<p>In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).</p>
<p>We're slightly breaking our usual rule this Sunday to allow two events for France. The French schedule of events is so dense, we end up overlooking many of them each weekend in only picking one, so we're selecting two equally important fixtures for this Sunday.</p>
<p>Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).</p>

<p>This weekend's highlights are back to our two update format (partly because of the density of events in the UK and France, so we want to give more time to breathe).</p>
<p>The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the <em>Scottish</em> Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )</p>
<p>The Scottish clause here gives us two updates for the UK, one in Scotland and one down south! Meanwhile, in general, this is obviously a weekend for bootcamps, with 3 of them in Europe, and two of those full weekend events!</p>
<p>In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).</p>

<p>It's often said that the junior part of any sport is the most important part, as it contains its future.
Scottish Junior Roller Derby's first club, Fierce Valley Roller Cubs, is no more, but two of its graduates are now starting to make waves in Scotland, and the UK.</p>
<p>We thought it was a good time to talk to Skye ("Bee"), and Callie ("Cal-amity") MacIntyre; earlier this year, Skye (guest) bench-coached the victorious Lincolnshire Bombinos away against Newcastle Junior Roller Derby, with Callie awarded Best Jammer in the same bout. They both have a lot of past experience, and ideas for the future, of Roller Derby, so what better people to talk to?</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Picture of the Lincolnshire Bombinos team, including Callie, and Skye (Bench coach)" src="images/2019/06/Callie_and_Skye.jpg"><p class="caption">Lincolnshire Bombinos, with Callie (#999) and Skye (Bench, right). [Photo: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.incidentlight.co.uk/">incidentlight</a>]</p>
</div>
<p><em>So I guess we'll start with a bit of history: how long has it been since you two started derby?</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Skye</dt>
<dd>Callie and I both started in about June 2014, through Fierce Valley [Roller Cubs] and we haven't stopped since! Callie had a wee few months break between Cubs disbanding and Rollerstop opening up, but that hasn't swayed her in any way. Roller derby is one of the main sports that both of us have picked up and kept at as there is so much appeal for us 😁😁</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>So, let's talk about the appeal for each of you: why did you start playing... And why are you still playing now?</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Callie</dt>
<dd>I started to play because it was a different kind of sport: it wasn't like anything that I had played before, and I though it was really interesting. Now I play because I love to meet new people when I play against different teams, and I gain new experiences when I play with different teams because everyone is taught differently.</dd>
<dt>Skye</dt>
<dd>
<p class="first">Roller Derby is appealing because there is such a lovely community, that's the main thing for me. Granted, there's some competition between skaters/teams but that's present in any sport. I have always loved roller skating, ever since I was wee. I'd love to continue with derby and have loads of new experiences like trying for Team Scotland and maybe playing for the World Cup.</p>
<p class="last">Nothing has really changed for us as we were still juniors (except the rules, haha) but the changes make Derby. We can adapt to it and grow from learning all these new things that are being introduced. I love that derby is becoming more mainstream and the sport that we love and spend most of our time playing, is becoming bigger and more people are growing to love Roller Derby too 🙂</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>So, for you, Skye, you're now on the Bairn City Rollers, was that a big change for you, moving from Juniors to the BCR training and bouting ?</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Skye</dt>

<p class="first">It was a scary jump as a junior because I'd seen all these adult Derby games and been thinking "wow... this is intense..." but, when I finally made the jump, the only difference was that everyone else was physically bigger (as in stronger and more skilled). It was still the same game, it was still the same rules, and I still loved it. I'd really urge anyone who's been in Juniors and is about to age out to make the jump, it's so worth it! It may be daunting but go for it.</p>
<p class="last">Callie is itching to move up to adult derby 😂</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>Callie, before the game we're going to get onto, you had a previous practice &amp; Scrimmage with the [Lincolnshire] Bombinos - how did that happen, and do you have memories / thoughts about it?</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Callie</dt>
<dd>
<p class="first">Initially I went to Team GB [Junior Roller Derby] training in Oldham, where I met some of the Bombinos.</p>
<p>That's where I got my foot in the door... My mum struck up a friendship with one of the Bombinos coaches (Beverley Gormley) who has been fantastic, sending us links for games we might be interested in. I then went to a mixed game in Sheffield and I met the rest of the Bombinos there.</p>
<p>I have become really good friends with Eve (Lady Macdeath) and a few of the other Bombinos. At the game the children's parents, who have never met me, were supporting me all through the game and I won best jammer too.</p>
<p class="last">I was feeling really accomplished: I've been playing Roller Derby for a very long time, and to get an award for a very exciting game was so good.  To hear the Bombinos shouting encouraging words was a fantastic feeling, too.</p>

<p><em>So, let's talk about the game in more detail!
How was it being benched by / benching your sister?</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Callie</dt>
<dd>I thought it was really fun because I know her very well and I respect her, so it was easy listening to her and everyone in the team respected her . She was really supportive towards the whole team and never gave up which made everyone respect her more. She was so enthusiastic which I loved about her.</dd>
<dt>Skye</dt>
<dd>It was really fun as I have played against, and alongside, Callie but never benched her in a game situation. I've never had a chance to take a step back and see her get her "game face" on and see her play as an independent skater. She listened to me as well (which she never does!) which was amazing and just seeing her having fun meant a lot 😊</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>So, this was also your first time benching a public game, Skye... How much practice had you had previously?
(and would you do anything different next time you bench?)</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Skye</dt>
<dd>
<p class="first">I've had previous experience coaching Juniors and benching internal scrims but in all honesty, I was still asking questions about effective benching when we got to Newcastle 😂 . As it was a junior game, though, I felt confident benching the game for them.
I've been looking to bench a public Juniors game for ages and amazingly this opportunity popped up, and I'm super grateful to the Bombinos for allowing me to bench.</p>
<p>As for doing anything differently; I hadn't trained with [the Bombinos] so I didn't know what their tactics were and how they played, so I'd try and do a bit more research 😊.</p>
<p>But the feedback I got from the Bombinos was great! They all enjoyed my benching and how I handled it: they felt that I was very relatable as I am about their age, and was very relaxed and not intimidating. They also said that I was very supportive when shouting "you've got this!" And "keep going!" etc. as they passed the bench. So much so that they commented on the [Bairn City Rollers] page that they liked me so much that they were wanting to steal me and take me to Lincolnshire 😁😁</p>
<p class="last">All I wanted to do was help lead them to victory, and they did us proud with an over 100 point lead 😊😊</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>And are you tempted to try more non-competitive roles in future (announcing? Refereeing?)
(Callie: how do you feel about trying a non-skating role? Anything tempt you?)</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Callie</dt>
<dd>I would love to bench a game once, maybe refereeing. I've always been interested in benching as it is something I feel like I would be strong at. I always have experience when I'm training as I am usually captain when we are doing scrims.</dd>
<dt>Skye</dt>
<dd>
<p class="first">I would potentially look at refereeing as I got older. I would happily do the cake stall at derby games again though 😂</p>
<p class="last">I would love to bench again and I would be more than happy to help out as an NSO, but coaching, benching, and skating is where it's at for me at this exact moment in time. I'm even thinking about attending the Coaching bootcamp in York later this year [ ], because I know there is a lot of junior skating talent that is ready to be developed and I want to be one of the people that could help 😊😊.</p>

</div>
<p><em>So, Callie: what interests you about benching?</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Callie</dt>
<dd>I'd really like to bench because it gives me better leadership experience, I also have some more re games under my belt than the newer kids. I would love to guide them and use the skills and tactics I have learned through my previous games with Fierce Valley Roller Cubs and the more recent games with Lincolnshire and the Sheffield and Newcastle juniors to take other juniors to a win. Although, its not the winning that counts really, its that everyone feels good and enjoys themselves</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>That's a very positive attitude to have!</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Callie</dt>
<dd>That's what Derby has taught me: we lost at our Sheffield game, but I came away with a lot more friends I would never have met if I hadn't been there</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>Speaking of all the contacts you guys now have, what're your plans for the future in general, as skaters?</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Skye</dt>
<dd>For me, trying for Team Scotland and the World Cup. That's the dream 😁😁</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>For 202x?</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Skye</dt>
<dd>Yeah 202x. I've made friends with Eve who is about to age up to the adult teams and she may potentially try out as well 😊</dd>
<dt>Callie</dt>
<dd>For me, it's attending more games with the other Juniors, aiming for Team GB: I would love to represent Scottish Junior Derby as part of that.
I want to help my sister coach and develop other kids, as well as me, until I am 16 and can move to an adult team. Then I want to push myself as far as I can with that. Team GB is a huge focus for me for the future.</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>Do you feel that it would help to have more Junior Derby in Scotland, or is the Rollerstop team in Glasgow enough to keep new talent coming?</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Callie</dt>
<dd>
<p class="first">Personally, I think we we need more. There are new teams out there but games are few and far between at the moment. I am travelling to England to get games on my level because I have been skating for years whereas some others are very new to it. Once they are all up and running it will be great but a larger number of teams over the Scotland area will encourage more teams to travel to play.</p>
<p>Hopefully there will be other leagues who see the value in a junior team and maybe start some up.</p>
<p>The talent we have in Scotland is there, it just needs a helping hand 😀</p>
<p class="last">Skye is coaching the kids [at Rollerstop] right now but I know she has an idea that I hope she can develop.
It's doing concentrated training for level 3 skaters with a view to getting them ready for going to an adult team. Also for Junior British Champs if it happens and for trying out for Team GB. Right now it's just an idea, but it would let kids like me train on a level that perhaps some newer skaters aren't at yet, and would hopefully give them drive to get there and join in.</p>

</div>
<p><em>Skye, do you want to talk a bit about that plan too?</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Skye</dt>
<dd>
<p class="first">My mum was talking to a few people who wanted to discuss the idea of a Junior British Champs for the future and the options for that, and it came to mind that whilst the kids are training, why not "up the level" for the kids who want to take that next step. The "tweens" who aren't old enough for adult teams but are ready for the next level of game play which is essentially adult games.</p>
<p class="last">What do they do in the inbetween times? I know, I have been there and it's tough. Adults want to help train, but the idea of maybe full contact scrimmage with people who are legally still children can be offputting.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>So, in Australia, there's a whole multi-level thing for modified contact scrimmage and so on, which might help with that, too.</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Skye</dt>
<dd>
<p class="first">If that would help then yeah, all for it and looking at it. Anything to bring more people to the sport and keep them with it.</p>
<p>I would love to talk with coaches for adult teams, see if there can be some sort of programme of skills that can be shared, best practise maybe to keep the kids inbetween Junior and Adult leagues active and keen and looking forward to their next steps.</p>
<p class="last">Mum and I honestly just talked about it 2 days ago. It made sense because when I was in limbo, before the Bairns took me on, I nearly quit and it would have been a mistake to have done that.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>It was very difficult for junior derby in Scotland in general, about then</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Skye</dt>
<dd>
<p class="first">We thought we were losing it altogether, no one's fault, but we are so glad it didn't disappear totally</p>
<p class="last">I owe a lot to Coach CB and the rest of the Fierce Valley team, and the Bairns as well 😊</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>Callie, what about you - how did you manage in the gap between FVRC closing, and then your current Rollerstop + sort-of-guest-Bombinos-skater position?</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Callie</dt>
<dd>I kept up skating at Rollerstop in general, just to keep me moving. Rollerstop Derby lessons came at the right time, although we even looked at the logistics of going to Newcastle for Derby if need be, but it just wouldn't have worked long term.</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>I know your mum's been very committed to helping you keep going in Roller Derby...</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Callie</dt>
<dd>
<p class="first">Haha, she hasn't been at home for the last few weekends because of derby, always driving us to games, supporting us, washing our kit (!) (the most important part) and meeting more Derby parents to get us out there.</p>
<p class="last">She sees the benefits in Derby to us, confidence, health, experiences and new friends 🙂</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>It's a really good relationship you three all have 🙂</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Skye</dt>
<dd>Mum has been a huge support in our derby career, she's been our taxi driver to games and a massive help. She continues to support us through our derby lives 😊</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>So, this has been a great interview, really: but I want to hand over the mic to you guys, if there's anything you want to add that we've not covered?</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Skye</dt>
<dd>
<p class="first">Both Callie and I think that Junior Roller Derby needs to be spoken about and put out there a wee bit more and we are glad that there is more recognition about the sport.</p>
<p class="last">I'm also super glad about the fact that (some) teams are opening up to 16-17 year olds as it's giving Juniors more of a chance to train.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Callie</dt>
<dd>[I] would love to see more Junior teams in Scotland so there are more teams to play and gain more experience, and that some games between teams across the border and here become more frequent 😊</dd>

<p>With the fifth WFTDA official rating and ranking of the season, still in the old location due to delays in launching the shiny new stats portal, (<strong><a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-may-31-2019/">https://wftda.com/rankings-may-31-2019/</a></strong>), we're keeping to our promise to update our "Road to Playoffs series".</p>
<!-- wp:image {"id":27904} -->

<p><img alt="All the locations with teams in our top 100 (larger stars mean more than one team is in the list - for example, 2x4 and Sailor City in Buenos Aires)" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/06/RoadToPlayoffs-060619.png" title="All the locations with teams in our top 100 (larger stars mean more than one team is in the list - for example, 2x4 and Sailor City in Buenos Aires)">All the locations with teams in our top 100 (larger stars mean more than one team is in the list - for example, 2x4 and Sailor City in Buenos Aires)

<p>Speedy Convalesce, Head NSO of Mannheim's Delta Quads, as well as many other things, is here to help us better visualise what's likely to happen at Playoff selection. This ongoing series reports the ratings and rankings of the top 100 WFTDA teams, calculated as <em>if we were at June 30th 2019</em> [the ranking which will be used to decide Qualifications and seedings into both WFTDA Playoffs, and the Continental Cups].
Whilst we can't predict the future, this will give the best guess of what teams need to do to qualify, based on what they've already done. This means that this will be the penultimate edition of the Road to Playoffs series.</p>
<p>As well as attaining a minimum ranking, teams also need to play at least 4 bouts within the eligibility period (December 2018 to June 2019), and we'll be tracking their progress on this measure, too.</p>
<p>The list, updated for this month: (# is number of bouts contributing to the ranking, whilst #El is the number of bouts contributing to their eligibility for playoffs). We'll <span style="color:red">colour</span> teams to indicate when they've played their minimum number of games for eligibility, but as yet, it's too early for anyone to have met this. We've eliminated any teams which have played less than 2 games since July 2018 here. Teams which have shifted rating (or entered the chart for the first time) since the last article are in <strong>BOLD</strong></p>

<p>[We plan to update this list each time WFTDA release a rating and ranking until Playoffs selections]</p>
<p>As usual, a lot of the biggest teams are latest to meet their minimum eligibility targets, which is often a strategic choice about giving things away too soon. (There's also an obvious risk, if you're safely rated near the top, to playing more games, given your current rating is really good.)</p>

<p>As there's a bit less on this weekend, we're doing the one update of Highlights for Saturday through Monday.</p>
<p>The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the <em>Scottish</em> Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )</p>
<p>This weekend has some excitingly huge tournaments, in Australia in particular, but also France; as well as some big bootcamps (in Germany, and China). It's also the weekend of the last fixtures in the French and Finnish national tournaments - and the first ever fixture in the ARDE-run Spanish National Championships!</p>
<p>In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).</p>
<p>Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://northernbrisbanerollers.com.au/">Northern Brisbane Rollers</a> host the 2019 edition of the Royal Rumble tournament, one of the famously huge regular Australiasian tournaments. This event has two divisions: an "indie" and a WFTDA division. The WFTDA bouts seem to be already set, to get WFTDA sanctioned games; the indie division is organised as a group
stage (with 4 groups of 3), into additional approximate placement games for the #1 and #2 teams from the groups.</p>
<p>It appears to us that the "Indie teams" bouts are also less than the standard 2x30 minute period length...</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://beijingrollerderby.weebly.com/">Beijing Roller Derby</a> host a Roller Derby "Sur5al Bootcamp", an intensive bootcamp in all aspects of WFTDA derby. The morning includes an introductory session on what WFTDA derby is, into parallel sessions on skater-skills, and officiating-skills. After lunch, there are sessions on
communication, followed by a practical series of skater drills (with on-the-job training for officials as part of this), finalising with a block of Sur5al-rules scrimmage to end the day. [EDIT: as of this update, the programme of events has changed - this is now a <a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com/short-track-roller-derby-resources/">Rolla Skate Club</a> Short Track Roller Derby scrimmage ending the day!</p>

<p>The Sunday edition for this weekend is a lot shorter than the main weekend update, but these fixtures are all still true highlights for us.</p>
<p>Both highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the <em>Scottish</em> Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc.</p>
<p>In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).</p>
<p>Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).</p>

<p>There are far too many valuable fixtures to cover all of them (especially in France and the UK, which tend to
have multiple tournaments, bootcamps etc all on one weekend), but we also don't want to be so strict as to have
just 1 per country. So, we'll be doing the following:</p>
<p>Two highlights a weekend - Sat + (All Weekend); and then a smaller one for Sunday.</p>
<p>Both highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the <em>Scottish</em> Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )</p>
<p>This weekend is particularly rich in short-format events, with Sur5al, Roller Derby Sevens, and Short Track Roller Derby all happening around the world! There's also a world premiere of the new Street Roller Derby ruleset (in Germany), which is another attempt at producing a simpler, easier-to-officiate version of the game.</p>
<p>In the UK, the <em>Scottish Clause</em> means we're covering 3 different events, as our leagues are all off down south to play derby this weekend!</p>
<p>In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).</p>
<p>Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).</p>

Street Roller Derby is yet another ruleset designed to make Roller Derby easier and more convenient to play, with less officiating load, and a simplified ruleset. (In the case of Street Roller Derby: officiating is managed by skaters not currently playing; there's no "Lead Jammer" powers; scoring, like in Short Track is 1 point per pass, not per skater passed; there's also no set duration; a reduced penalty list; and harsher penalty rules (a penalty has you sit out the rest of the jam!) ).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this ruleset is currently only really being promoted on Facebook. We hope that it will become more accessible to non-Facebook users in future.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://arizonarollerderby.com/">Arizona Roller Derby</a> hosts the return of their Monsoon Madness invitiational, with two simultaneous tournaments - one A team, and one B team. The A team tier is, of course, WFTDA Sanctioned.
This is of interest to us due to the attendence of Buenos Aires' <em>`2x4 Roller Derby`_</em> in both tiers - Team OSOM in A, and Lxs Pibxs in B. As with Finvitational, this is <em>almost</em> a round-robin for both tiers!</p>

<p><em>We're happy to present this guest post from Hulls Angels Roller Derby's All Stars Captain, Wilken, on their recent experience at the Aalborg-hosted The Northern Takedown international tournament.</em></p>
<p>On May 4th 2019 Hulls Angels All-Stars travelled to Denmark to participate in Aalborg Roller Derby’s TNT (The Northern Takedown) Tournament.</p>
<p>This is the 3rd year Aalborg’s Combat Bullies have hosted a tournament and the first year which HARD has competed.</p>
<p>Not only was the tournament the first international tournament HARD has competed in, it was my first tournament as Captain.</p>
<p>Looking at the rosters of the other teams (Belfast Roller Derby, Rockcity Rollers, Cologne’s Graveyard Queens and the hosts Aalborg’s Combat Bullies) it was clear that this was going to be a tough tournament! Not only did we have 3 (!) games on the Saturday we were also only taking 9 skaters.</p>
<p>Nerves aside, the key mantra for this weekend was that we were going to play our game which involved lots of phrases such as ‘butts in holes!’ lurrr and slurrrr’ and ‘back, back, back’ like ducks quacking.</p>
<p>A special shout out goes to my Vice-Captain Milv, who not only organised the bulk of the trip but sorted out a cabin in the woods for us to stay in. There was definitely some Friday 13th vibes going on as we walked into the living room to see massive film posters with superimposed Danish politicians’ faces on them! Anyways! Bunk beds were allocated and a food shop to Aldi was done! Thrill Murray cooked up a super tasty pasta salad so we could carb load ready for the following day.</p>
<p>Aalborg Roller Derby have a fantastic venue and were superb hosts throughout the whole weekend with cracking food provided and a wonderful airy venue.</p>
<p>The first game was against Belfast, and it seemed to fly by! After an anxious start we slowly settled into a rhythm and despite having four(!) foul outs (oops!) we’d cinched our first victory abroad! For me, I was happy with one win as Hulls Angels have never managed to claim a win in Europe before! But our offensive powerhouse Hi-Jaxxx spurred us all on for more as we prepared to take on the top seed of the tournament- Eindhoven’s Rockcity Rollers.</p>

<p>I feel that it was this game in which we really started to hit our groove. The first game was full of nervous energy, but here we kept calm and focused and on the game plan.</p>
<p>As the game got underway, our newly promoted All Star jammer Dani was smashing through walls as if they weren’t there, Purdy opened up holes for our jammers whilst simultaneously shutting down the opposition. Rockcity were tough but we were living up to our name. At the end of the game we managed to sneak a narrow victory!</p>
<p>Two wins down and I was on cloud nine! But we still had our last game of the day to go. Pressure mounted as we realised that if we won this game, we were guaranteed a medal! Bench Coach Rollo made sure we stayed centred and focused as we prepared to close Saturday against Cologne, who like us had also played three games in one day.</p>
<p>Although both teams were beginning to run low on energy, Cologne went out hard and fast! We really had to dig in and band together. At times the game could have gone either way! But as the clock ticked down and the final whistle was blown, we could hardly believe we had done it. Three wins in one day and a guaranteed a medal!</p>
<p>As we all got back to our creepy cabin, had a hot shower and nursed our aches and pains, it actually dawned on us…. What if? What if we could win this?</p>
<p>Thankfully on the Sunday we only had one game- the hosts Aalborg’s Combat Bullies.</p>

<p>Despite Aalborg already having played that day we knew that this would not have given us any advantage. We had been fortunate enough to have watched their previous games and they looked like strong hitters that played a very physical game! We weren’t wrong!</p>
<p>As the game got underway, Aalborg had begun to rack up an uncomfortable lead, so a tactical time out was called by Rollo, to focus. This seemed to do the trick, as we went back on track with a new energy. F-Bomb was closing down any enterprising jammers wanting to sneak up the inside line, Melon Collie was the glue of the team, keeping us together and keeping us calm when the pack started to speed up. Frost Spite was defying the laws of physics as she jammed for what must have felt like jam 200! But it was then that the tide began to turn back in our favour! That gold medal was within sniffing distance!!!</p>
<p>The final whistle blew………. and that was it! We’d done it! And I am pretty sure most of us are still wearing out medals now!</p>
<p>I truly feel that this weekend was a mammoth team effort. We could not have skated as well as we did if it was not for our amazing bench crew; Bench Coach Rollo for winning his first official review! Line Up Manager Ju for not losing her head when we may have been losing ours, and Mansfield Roller Derby’s Dragon’s Jen, who was so supportive and quick with the feedback. You were all completely invaluable. Thank you.</p>
<p>On behalf of Hulls Angels All-Stars, I would also like to thank everyone involved in organising and taking part in The Northern Takedown 2019,  the NSOs, referees, announcers, photographers, catering staff, volunteers and Aalborg Roller Derby. For our first European tournament you have set the bar very high! Amanda! We missed you every day!</p>
<p>Overall, it was a weekend of sweat ‘taches, strangling goose poses, wooden giants, paracetamol, sunshine and fun. I can’t wait for the next one! Groove is in the Hull!!</p>
<p>And I won a hat! #winnerwinnerchickendinner</p>
