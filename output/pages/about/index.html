<strong>The Blog</strong>
<p>The Scottish Roller Derby blog was started back in the summer of 2011, and since then, has covered the sport across Scotland, the UK, and beyond. As well as a focus on promoting Scottish Roller Derby, with both the local teams and the two National Squads, we also like to promote the spread of Roller Derby worldwide; we do international interviews, support services (like multi-timezone tournament guides), statistical analysis and more.</p>
<p><strong>The Admin Team</strong>-</p>
<p><em>aoanla</em></p>
<p>aoanla is a physicist/systems support guy for the UK bit of the LHC experiment at CERN in real life, and therefore already had some experience in looking at high-speed collisions before getting into roller derby. He started out writing bout reports for the bouts he turned up to on his own <a href="http://aoanla.blogspot.com/">blog</a> [since inactive after moving here], and has also developed quite a lot of the statistical work that we write about. He's a contributor to the Flat Track Stats bout archive moderation effort, as well as to various other rating and organisation efforts. He is a member of the Roller Derby World Cup Committee 2017-. (He/him, They/Them)</p>
<p><strong>The Author Team</strong></p>
<p>Every bouting league in the country has the right to be represented on the Scottish Roller Derby blog by a skater, nso, or referee, and our author team also represent the worlds of Women's, Men's, All-Gender/Open To All, and Junior Roller Derby. Between them, they have decades of skating and organisational experience.</p>
