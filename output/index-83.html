<span class="s1">We’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <span class="s2"><b><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">Flat Track Stats</a></b></span> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <b><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></b>.</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <b><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></b> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). (SRDRank also has recent WFTDA rankings, including the 31st June ranking, as well as SRDRank, and allows you to make predictions from them.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]</span></p>
(Note: we're especially likely to be missing items this week, as Facebook's response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal has resulted in them turning off large parts of the services we use to automatically collate events for this article. We don't think we've missed <i>too</i> much, but...)

<span class="s1">We’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <span class="s2"><b><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">Flat Track Stats</a></b></span> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <b><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></b>.</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <b><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></b> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). (SRDRank also has recent WFTDA rankings, including the 31st June ranking, as well as SRDRank, and allows you to make predictions from them.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]</span></p>
(Note: we're especially likely to be missing items this week, as Facebook's response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal has resulted in them turning off large parts of the services we use to automatically collate events for this article. We don't think we've missed <i>too</i> much, but...)

<p>Our game against Inverness City Roller Derby is less than a week away for us at NTRG and we’re eager to share our thoughts on it with you! 4 of our skating team have answered what they are most looking forward to; what they’ve been doing outside of training to prep for the game and who they think will win!
Storm in a D Cup, Millie Manslaughter, Mother Tucker and Hazzard are here to share their pre game insights with you all!</p>
<p><strong>Storm in a D Cup 69
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-26609" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/04/storminad.jpg?w=450" alt="StormInAD" width="225" height="300"></strong></p>
<p>The thing I am looking forward to most about game day is that feeling of team comraderie. The sick, excited and nervous butterflies-in-your-stomach feeling as we all pile into the bus or car. How we will all send a million messages to our team mates sharing experiences, offering support and motivation.  I am not someone who has ever been involved in sport. I now look back with a bit of regret that I did not do something like this when I was younger. I feel grateful for finding something that I am proud of, for finding all these amazing women who are completely different, but for one day the same. We are all trying our best to succeed, support and survive.</p>
<p>Time is my biggest challenge in most things. Full time work, family and trying to maintain a reasonable quality of life leaves me spread a bit thin. When it comes preparing for an upcoming game I find I absorb myself in You Tube videos for hints and tips, watch games on my phone during my commute, and practise in the kitchen while doing laundry and the dishes. I am lucky that my kids love skating, helping them and playing skatey games not only improves my skills but keeps me calm, it always reminds me that I am doing this for fun.</p>
<p>The one thing I have discovered is that it’s not important who wins. After past games it is the last thing we talk about. We laugh and joke, while comparing bumps and bruises. We learn and grow from our experience playing with other teams. We become better players. I know we all will try our best, and if we lose we will still hold our heads high and celebrate with the victors without fear of being judged as inferior.  Just as I know we won’t judge them….when we kick their butts!</p>
<p><strong>Millie Manslaughter 5</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-26610" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/04/millemanslaughter.jpg?w=450" alt="MilleManslaughter" width="225" height="300"></p>
<p>I am looking forward to seeing how well the team comes together because we have been working and training hard so it will be great to see if our hard work has payed off or not. It will also be nice for the team to spend some time together.</p>
<p>I have recently bought a pushbike. I’m loving going out , having the wind in my face and the freedom of just pedalling with no end goal. I have also started doing the 5k parkrun on a saturday morning. It's so much more fun than a treadmill.</p>
<p>Mentally I made myself a list of goals for this game at the beginning of march and I think about them each training. I have also been watching more derby online so that I canlearn more and improve my gameplay.</p>
<p>I'm not sure who will win but I can predict it will be exciting!!</p>
<p>Watch out Inverness, Millie Manslaughter's coming for you!! 😀😀</p>
<h2>whoarewe #NTRG</h2>
<p><strong>Mother Tucker 79</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-26611" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/04/mothertucker.jpg?w=450" alt="MotherTucker" width="225" height="300"></p>
<p>The pre-match build up: Skating out with the team before the game - it’s great to go out and hear everyone cheering your team.  When your name’s announced, you feel all special for a moment or two, then you cheer all the other team members! Also, huddling round just and doing our chant is pretty awesome.</p>
<p>I try not to overthink games!  From a physical training point of view, I went along to a GMRD session recently which was a real eye-opener.  Their level of gameplay is so fast and tactical and I learned so much in just a couple of hours. I followed that up by playing in an ARRG event last week which was brilliant.  It gave me a chance to practice some of the things we’ve been working on at our team training sessions and I played really well and came out of it feeling amazing!</p>
<p>I think it’ll be a good game to watch and if we can communicate well and put into practice what we’ve been focusing on at training, then I reckon NTRG will win!</p>
<p><strong>Hazzard 810</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-26612" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/04/hazzard.jpg?w=450" alt="Hazzard" width="225" height="300"></p>
<p>I’m very much looking forward to playing with the team! It’s the first time we’ve been able to train for and play games consistently within a short period of time and it’s a great bonding experience not just for the skating team but for the entire league as well! We have a host of supporters coming up for Inverness so it’s gonna be NTRG tastic!</p>
<p>I’ve been hitting the gym a lot lately as I have some personal derby goals that I’m wanting to achieve which require me to up both my mental and physical derby game. For the mental side I’ve been watching tons of games online and just drilling derby in to my head even more so than it already is! It’s definitely helping me reach new derby heights and as Inverness is now just round the corner I’m eager to see if all the hard work has been paying off!</p>
<p>I hope that it’s us but I think it’s going to be closely matched either way! We seem very similar to ICRD in the array of experience in our skating teams and that’s bound to make for a super exciting game between us!</p>

<p>The Dundee league previously known as DRG have re-branded to Dundee Roller Derby this month. Although league members have been hinting at this for a while, the financial and business aspects, have led to a longer than expected timeframe for this re-brand.
<img class="  wp-image-26597 aligncenter" src="2018/04/29884504_2031848993705292_1278327300_o.png" alt="Quote from DRD" width="410" height="410"></p>
<p>With it well underway however, we spoke to a few league members to understand what this means to them, obviously paired with a few snapshots of the league!</p>
<p><em>"For me, every single league member deserves to be part of our name, rather than only those that identify with the word "girls"."</em> - Gegg</p>
<p><em>"I started roller derby at 36, I hadn't been a girl for a long time. Think this is brilliant and so much more inclusive".</em> - Emma Belter</p>
<p><em>"It shows the progression and maturity of our league. We showed what we can do on track last year and made our name as a league by our games, now we are taking another step and showing our league for who we really are and what we believe in. Seeing everyone as an individual and including all as part of DRD"</em>. - Goldginger</p>
<p><em>"When we say: We Are The DRD at games, it really will mean "we" now!"</em> - Nichola</p>
<p><em>"The change of name represents the bigger changes that are happening in roller derby worldwide, and our name will now finally reflect every member of our league."</em> - Liston</p>
<p><em>"I personally identify as a girl, but it took me a long time to be okay with that, and I think it's really cool that people that don't are now part of the league not just in person but in name to!"</em> - Amy</p>
<p><em>"The rebrand shows we are a league inclusive and transparent to everyone. Everyone is heard!"</em> - Tiny Tearaway</p>
<p><em>It means to me that we can be fully inclusive of everyone, and convey that message on to this and the next generation as well that anyone can do Derby, you just have to believe in yourself!"</em> - KinKhey</p>
<p><em>"This change signifies that we are not just skaters here. We are officials, volunteers, NSOs, friends and family. Dundee is an inclusive league of everyone; anyone wishing to be a member of our league can be and that is now represented in our name."</em>- Shuggs Bunny</p>

<p></p>
<p>This year, the <a href="http://mrdwc.com/schedule-2018/"><strong>Men's Roller Derby World Cup</strong></a> is trying something new with its tournament format. Nothing so radical as the Roller Derby World Cup in Manchester - they're still using Groups and Elimination to sort their teams - but they're playing a bit with that transition from Group to Elimination Tournament in an interesting way.</p>
<p>Traditionally, we want to arrange the number of Groups to be a power of 2 - 2,4,8 - because this means that if we allow the top 1 or 2 to graduate in each Group, we also have a power of 2 number of teams playing in the Elimination phase. Elimination phases work most straightforwardly when there are a power of 2 teams playing, so this is a good thing.</p>
<p>MRDWC also wants a power of 2 number of teams in their Elimination - they want 8 of them - but there are 24 teams playing. (Originally, there were 25, which is even worse, and that situation made the following approach look like the best one.) Whilst 24 is divisible by 8, the result is 3, and Groups of 3 are rather hard to balance well; similarly, Groups of 6 (with 4 such) are quite large, and need a lot of games per Group (15, for a total of 60 games in the Group phase).
Instead, MRDWC have decided to have 6 Groups of 4...</p>
<p>...but this leaves them with the problem of how do you pick 8 teams to go forward, when there's only 6 Groups?
The solution MRDWC have adopted is to allow all 6 "winners" of their Group to go through, and then supplement them with the "best" 2 of the 2nd-place teams in the Groups. (That is: of the 6 teams who placed 2nd in a Group, we try to pick the best 2 of them.) This is obviously tricky to do fairly, and the solution which MRDWC are using is to assume that the "total points difference, not counting the worst game" is a fair enough yardstick.</p>
<p>All of the teams have played 2/3 of their games now, at the end of Day 1, so we should have a pretty good idea of how they're doing - and we can have a stab at using inference to predict their final games, too, to make a prediction of who will get those two extra Elimination Slots.</p>
<p>Where we have used actual scores, these are taken from the official MRDWC score page, linked at the top of this article.</p>
<p>Groups: <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/04/05/mrdwc2018-day-1-scores-and-analysis/2">RED</a></strong> <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/04/05/mrdwc2018-day-1-scores-and-analysis/3"><strong>ORANGE</strong></a> <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/04/05/mrdwc2018-day-1-scores-and-analysis/4"><strong>YELLOW</strong></a> <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/04/05/mrdwc2018-day-1-scores-and-analysis/5"><strong>GREEN</strong></a> <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/04/05/mrdwc2018-day-1-scores-and-analysis/6"><strong>BLUE</strong></a> <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/04/05/mrdwc2018-day-1-scores-and-analysis/7"><strong>PURPLE</strong></a>
Day Two: <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/04/05/mrdwc2018-day-1-scores-and-analysis/8"><strong>Predictions and Games To Watch</strong></a>
<!--nextpage-->
Starting with Group RED:</p>
<p>the Scores to date are:</p>
<p>USA 286 : 0 NED
BEL 189 : 53 JPN
USA 311 : 0 JPN
BEL 164 : 46 NED</p>
<p>Given that the USA are very likely group winners, we can ignore games against them for points difference, as those will be the worst games for the other team - as a result, we only know Belgium's final "effective" P/D for the group, which is 254.
Japan take their -136 from the Belgium game, and will add to it their P/D against Netherlands tomorrow. Similarly, Netherlands take their -118 from their Belgium game, and will add it to the P/D from the same game against Japan tomorrow.</p>
<p>Performing a linear regression against the existing scores, we can predict the following relative strengths in terms of expected P/D:
</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">USA:192.25
</span><span class="s1">BEL:20.25
</span><span class="s1">NED:-95.25
</span><span class="s1">JPN:-117.25</span></p>
Thus, the "most likely" results for the Japan/Netherlands game are a narrow 22 point win for Netherlands, giving a <strong>predicted</strong> P/D for the two teams as:
Netherlands: -96
Japan: -158
<p>This group has been remarkably consistent, and the R-squared value (a measure of how well we can explain the performances so far with a linear approximation) is 0.99, almost at the maximum value of 1!</p>
<!--nextpage-->

<p>Next, we'll look at Group ORANGE:
Scores to date are:
SWE 80 : 81 ESP
ENG 202 : 11 CHI
ENG 248 : 20 ESP
SWE 81 : 33 CHI</p>
<p>The big surprise for this group was the exceptionally close game between Sweden and Spain, which literally came down to the final pass in the final jam! England are causing no surprises, however, and are very likely to win the group - so we can discount their contributions to P/D for the other teams.
As a result, we only know the effective P/D for Sweden, which will be 47.
Spain carry forward their 1 point P/D against Sweden, and will add to it the P/D from playing Chile tomorrow; Chile carry forward their -48 from their game against Sweden, and will add the P/D against Spain.</p>
<p>Again, performing linear regression against the games so far, we predict relative strength as:
</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ENG:151.25
</span>SWE:-34.75
<span class="s1">ESP:-55.25</span>
CHI:-61.25</p>
Giving a predicted exceptionally close game between Spain and Chile tomorrow, with a P/D of only 6 for Spain (to win).
Thus, the most likely <strong>predicted</strong> P/Ds for those teams are:
Spain: 7
Chile: -54
<p>The R-squared measure for this group is noticeably lower than that for the previous group, at 0.848 - we expect the Spain/Chile game to be exceptionally hard to call, and 2nd place is up for grabs between Spain and Sweden as a result.</p>
<!--nextpage-->

<p>Moving now to Group YELLOW, where the final positions are possibly the hardest to call out of any of the groups.</p>
<p>Scores so far are:
AUS 254 : 42 COL
SCO 183 : 74 ITA
AUS 225 : 25 ITA
SCO 224 : 6 COL</p>
<p>Coming into this tournament, Australia were seeded as the "expected" winners of this group - however, comparing just the two games against Colombia, Scotland have the higher points differential (and held Colombia to a much lower score). As a result, it is exceptionally hard to predict even the 1st place position in this group.</p>
<p>Linear regression on the scores so far gives a <strong>predicted</strong> relative strength of:
</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">AUS:114.75
SCO:70.75
ITA:-63.25
</span><span class="s1">COL:-122.25</span></p>
However, the R-squared for this group is just 0.053, an incredibly low value. As a result, the expected standard error (the amount by which these strengths could be out by) is a huge 28 - larger than half the difference between Australia and Scotland, and thus an indicator that an upset is definitely possible.
<p>Group YELLOW, then, will come down to the results of the final two group games tomorrow!</p>
<!--nextpage-->

<p>Our next group, GREEN, is a return to a somewhat more predictable group in terms of performance.</p>
<p>Scores so far:
MEX 275 : 3 POL
CAN 182 : 5 GER
GER 160 : 34 POL
CAN 94 : 43 MEX</p>
<p>Whilst Mexico's performance against Poland was very impressive, Canada's win against them confirms Canada as the 1st place team in this group, and Mexico as 2nd place.</p>
<p>As such, we can only confirm the P/D for Poland at this point, at -398.
Germany will bring forward their P/D against Poland, 126, and add to it their P/D against Mexico; Mexico will bring forward their P/D against Poland, 272, and add it to their P/D against Germany!</p>
<p>Linear regression predicts:
</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CAN:135.25
MEX:89.25
GER:-46.75
</span><span class="s1">POL:-177.75</span></p>
(with an R-squared of 0.988, so a very consistent group)
And thus a resulting P/D between Germany and Mexico of 136 to the Mexicans.
<p>The resulting <strong>predicted</strong> P/Ds for Germany and Mexico will therefore be:
Mexico: 408  (!)
Germany: -10</p>
<!--nextpage-->

<p>Moving on to our second-last group, BLUE, we're back to a slightly inconsistent group - although nowhere to the extent of Yellow.</p>
<p>The scores so far are:
FRA 255 : 10 PHI
FIN 86 : 62 IRE
FRA 214 : 25 IRE
FIN 183 : 32 PHI</p>
<p>It's fairly clear that France are, as their seed suggested, the very likely winners of the group - so we can assume that their P/D contributions will be ignored for the other members of the group.
As a result, the only team with a "final" P/D is Finland, with 175.
Philippines will take their P/D versus Finland, of -151, and add the result of their game against Ireland; Ireland will take their P/D against Finland, of -24, and add the result of the same game to it.</p>
<p>Again, linear regression suggests likely strengths within the group are:
</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">FRA:129.625
FIN:15.125
IRE:-34.125
</span><span class="s1">PHI:-110.625</span></p>
<p class="p1">Leading to a predicted P/D for the Philippines / Ireland game of 76.5 in Ireland's favour, with a resulting <strong>predicted</strong> total P/D for those teams of:
Ireland: 52.5
Philippines: -227.5</p>
The R-squared for this group is a fairly low 0.644, however, with an attendant high standard error, so these results also come with a caution!
<!--nextpage-->

<p>Our final group is PURPLE.</p>
<p>Results for this group are:
WAL 225 : 22 DEN
ARG 244 : 38 NZ
WAL 185 : 23 NZ
ARG 231 : 21 DEN</p>
<p>Even without doing linear regression, we can see that the scores suggest that Wales and Argentina are actually fairly closely matched - like group Yellow, it's actually not completely certain that the top seed for the Group, Argentina, will win against the second seed, Wales.</p>
<p>Linear regression suggests strengths like:
</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ARG:110.375
WAL:84.875
NZ:-86.375
DEN:-108.875</span></p>
With the standard error on those strengths a relatively low 10.342 - but given the closeness of Argentina and Wales' strengths, enough to allow a possible upset.
<p><strong>Predicted</strong> P/Ds for the two games tomorrow are:
NZ - DEN: 22.5
ARG - WAL: 25.5</p>
<p>but the result for Argentina / Wales only matters to decide which team will be the 1st and which will be 2nd, as both have already played the games which decide their P/D for the group - Wales with P/D 365 and Argentina with P/D 416.</p>
<!--nextpage-->

<h4>Predictions looking ahead.</h4>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Looking ahead to the elimination phase, then, we can ask what the most likely 2nd Place teams are to make it into the top tier of the playoffs...</span></p>

<p>For some of the groups, the 2nd place team is fairly predictable, and we can use our "estimated" P/D to place their rough position in their peers when the teams have not played all relevant games. Where we have "predicted", we've used our best guess at the P/D for a game which has not been played - in the other cases, we're assuming only that the current likely winner of the Group actually wins.</p>
<p>RED: Belgium (P/D 254)
ORANGE: Spain (P/D [<strong>predicted</strong>] 7) [note: Sweden will probably have a higher P/D, but less wins]
(It is possible that Chile will win against Spain, in which case Sweden would take 2nd Place, with a P/D of 48, not enough to qualify for the Top 8)
GREEN: Mexico (P/D [<strong>predicted</strong>] 408)
BLUE: Finland (P/D 175)</p>
<p>For YELLOW and PURPLE, there is the potential for upsets, as 1st Place is in contention for both groups.</p>
<p>YELLOW: Scotland? (P/D 327)
YELLOW: Australia? (P/D 415)</p>
<p>PURPLE: Wales? (P/D 365)
PURPLE: Argentina? (P/D 416)</p>
<p>This leaves us with a very interesting position in terms of the promotion structure: if Australia and Argentina lose their groups, their P/Ds are very close, and very close to our estimated P/D for Mexico after their final game - the teams who qualify for the top 8 will be determined by Mexico's performance against Germany.</p>
<p>If Australia or Argentina lose their groups, then it looks like Wales and Scotland will be fighting it out between Yellow and Purple for the second "2nd Place" spot in the Top 8, with the result also depending on how well Mexico does...</p>
<p>So, it really is all to play for tomorrow, with the top 8 (and the rest of the leaderboard) really hinging on 3 important games:</p>
<p>Wales v Argentina [9am BST Track 2]
Australia v Scotland [10am BST Track 1]
Mexico v Germany [11am BST Track 2]
(Spain v Chile [midday BST Track 1])</p>

<span class="s1">We’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <span class="s2"><b><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">Flat Track Stats</a></b></span> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <b><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></b>.</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <b><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></b> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). (SRDRank also has recent WFTDA rankings, including the 31st June ranking, as well as SRDRank, and allows you to make predictions from them.)</span></p>

<span class="s1">We’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <span class="s2"><b><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">Flat Track Stats</a></b></span> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <b><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></b>.</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <b><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></b> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). (SRDRank also has recent WFTDA rankings, including the 31st June ranking, as well as SRDRank, and allows you to make predictions from them.)</span></p>

<p>After a late start due to the very wonderful <em>Roller Derby World Cup</em> earlier this year in Manchester (!), Dundee Roller Girls are hosting their Season Opener on <strong>15<sup>th</sup> of April 2018</strong> at the <strong>D.I.S.C. in Dundee</strong>!</p>
<p>Boasting an action packed day for both DRG's A and B team, doors open at <strong>12:30</strong> with tickets on the day at <strong>£6.</strong> You can look forward to <em>Fair City Rollers</em>' Fear Maidens facing off against the Bonnie Colliders at 1pm, with <em>Auld Reekie Roller Girls</em>' All Star Reserves taking the track against the Silvery Tayzers at 3pm!</p>
<p>With a new season of games, come new captains! So we thought we would have a wee chat with both teams' captains to see how the season is shaping up. First up is ALLY-J and Tiny Tearaway captaining the Bonnie Colliders!</p>

<tr>
<th style="text-align:right;">How long have you been skating?</th>
<td style="text-align:justify;">I’ve been quad skating with DRG since March 2016, so 2 years now (time flies!) but used to inline skate from the age of 10!</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">I have been skating 6 years this coming May (scary) and I have been with DRG for 2 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:right;">What does this season hold for the Colliders?</th>
<td style="text-align:justify;">We've had the opportunity of playing in Copenhagen, Newcastle and in our home town, and this season we're going to build as a whole Team! We totally found our feet working with each other, and we are looking at focusing on attendance, positivity and building our knowledge of the game!</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Yes its going to be very exciting for the Colliders. We have some fantastic games lined up already and a strong team full of skaters determined to be the best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:right;">As a B team, what challenges to you face?</th>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Finding our way of working together as a team. Fitting in our newest skaters and helping them gain lots more skills and understanding of the game.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">We are all part of a very supportive league so the challenges I see aren’t limited to us as a team. We face the same challenges as the A team; attendance, working together well and pushing ourselves to the best of our abilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:right;">How does the league, as a whole, carve space for the B team?</th>
<td style="text-align:justify;">As a league, our A and B team train together, which is an amazing opportunity. We are constantly learning from each other, talking over drills and skills; with us skating alongside folk from Team Scotland, really being able to learn from the best is our greatest asset.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">B team, A team who? We're a league that trains together. Skaters for both teams, crossovers and new skaters. We all do the same drills and are expected to put the same amount of hard work and effort into every one from the newer skaters to those who were on Team Scotland.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:right;">And if you could set goals for yourself and for the team this season?</th>
<td style="text-align:justify;">My personal goal is to work on my jammer skills and tactical knowledge. I want to work well for the team and push myself this season! For the Colliders: to focus on ourselves as a team. Although we are all building our personal skills, I really want everyone to bring positivity and sportsmanship to the Colliders.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Our B team has played and flourished with smaller numbers the past season. It would be great to see us play with higher numbers. This would give us the chance to have a solid jammer rotation and walls that are to be reckoned with. To be part of that jammer rotation is my goal for this season.</td>

<tr>
<th style="text-align:right;">How long have you been skating?</th>
<td style="text-align:justify;">6 years, started and stayed with DRG since then.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Skating for six years, initially with GCRD and have been with DRG for almost 2 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:right;">What does this season hold for the Tayzers?</th>
<td style="text-align:justify;">I'll probably cry and give dramatic speeches alot. Hoping that as a league we'll be able to continue to perform like we did last season but also move passed that, honing in our skill set. The Tayzers have always performed under a "get the job done, nae fancy shit" mentality and I want to continue that while progressing within the WFTDA rankings.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">We are continuing to evolve the skills, tactics and endurance that we've developed last season. Which will set us in good stead for the exciting and tough games we have lined up for this year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:right;">As an A team skater, how do you stay ontop of your game</th>
<td style="text-align:justify;">I hydrate and then spew it up if I go too fast.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Pepsi Max, avocados and hummus. And cross training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:right;">How has becoming a WFTDA league changed your priorities and training?</th>
<td style="text-align:justify;">I think it gives us clear global equivalents to try to compete against, which we haven't really had before. It's good to be able to feel super involved with the development of the sport as a whole, as well as having access to more teams.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">It allows us to skate against teams of a similar calibre at national and international level, as well as competing in tournaments! This emphasises the need for a strong mental game, the ability to work as a tight unit and to continue to function when the fatigue sets in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:right;">And if you could set a goal for yourself and your team?</th>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Finish a game without a spew or a cry, working on my mental game is a constant priority as well as my on track skills. As a team, I just want to end every game as a happy wee unit proud of what we have just done.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">My personal goal is the same as it was when I first started skating, which is to get lower! As a team if we can continue to work together, support each other on and off track and leave each game with a sense of achievement, then that's a job well done</td>

<p>The dust has barely settled since Granite City Roller Derby's Northern Fights took their first win of 2018 and it's already time to play another game.</p>
<p>This time though, it's going to be a little bit different...</p>
<p>Granite City Roller Derby are going to be hosting their first ever home teams game!  GCRD have never had the pleasure of hosting a home team game before.  We will have Team White versus Team Black.  Both teams will be made up mainly of GCRD skaters and will also feature some of our lovely friends from  further north.<a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/07/gcrd.png"><img width="2048" height="2048" alt="" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/07/gcrd.png" title="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22709"></a></p>
<p>Just because we're all pals, don't expect the teams to take it easy on each other. Considering the excellent results by both the Fight Hawks and the Northern Fights in 2017, this upcoming game promises to be interesting.</p>
<p>But before we even get to the home team game, we have one of my favourite things in the world. A Rising Stars game! A great opportunity for newer skaters to get some valuable game day experience. These games will let us see the new talent that northern Scottish roller derby has to offer. </p>
<p>So come along to the Beach Leisure Centre in Aberdeen from 12.30 pm on Saturday 31st March 2018 for our first game of the year.</p>
<p>Tickets are £4.00 with under 12s getting free entry</p>
<p>The first whistle will be at 1pm</p>

<p>In 2018 it seems Derby World cups are like busses, you wait so long for one to arrive and another appears just after it. February saw the Womens Roller Derby World Cup blow everyone away and now, thankfully, we are past its comedown. But it <em>is</em> time to get ready for the Men’s Roller Derby World Cup, which kicks off on the 5th of April in Barcelona. This is the third MRDWC; the first was held in England back in 2014, and the second was two years ago in Canada. Back at the first World Cup in 2014, 15 nations battled it out, that tally rose to 21 in Canada, and this year at Barcelona there will be 24 nations represented, with even more set to join in at the next MRDWC after this one.</p>
<p><a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/PowerOfScotland/">Power of Scotland</a> has featured at every MRDWC so far with its roster comprised of skaters from all over Scotland, as well as some from South of the border. From the first MRDWC to the current POS lineup going to Barcelona, <a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers/">Bairn City Rollers</a> has had its skaters featured in each of the squads. BCR's Gibb is one of only three skaters in the current PoS roster who have been present on all three of Power of Scotland’s final World Cup squads to date.</p>

<p>At the first World Cup <a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers/">BCR</a>’s current or past skaters accounted for over quarter of the POS squad. At the last MRDWC in 2016, six current or past BCR skaters made it onto the training squad, of which four made it into the final squad that traveled to Canada. This time around, partially thanks to injuries and retirements, they have two skaters who made the training squad and both will be at Barcelona with Power of Scotland. One will be skating (Gibb) and the other now as part of the staff (rEd Baron).</p>
<p>BCR are proud that they have skaters once again involved with of Power of Scotland at this World Cup. They are also very proud of their skaters' (past and present) achievements representing and playing for Power of Scotland since its inception.</p>

<p>Whilst we are used to seeing some faces from outside of Scotland in POS squads, we are not used to seeing our male skaters in Scotland appearing elsewhere on other National teams. That was until now! At this MRDWC there will be a couple of skaters that play and train in Scotland who will be representing nations other than Scotland, and both hail from Bairn City Rollers.</p>
<p><a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers/">BCR</a> are incredibly honoured and proud to say that in their ranks they have skaters who will be representing not one, not even two, but three different nations at Barcelona. On the track at the tournament along with Gibb representing Power of Scotland they will have Oliver lining up for <a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/WalesMensRollerDerby/">Team Wales</a> and Vezzani for <a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/mensrollerderbyteamitaly/">Team Italy</a>.
If you follow Men’s Derby in Scotland Oliver and Vezzani’s faces will be familiar but perhaps their names not-so-much: they have opted, like many, to play under their real surnames. Normally you would see Oliver playing under his derby name of Basha ROO, and Vezzani as Despicable V.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-26512 size-large" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/03/20180321_204624.jpg?w=700" alt="Team Italy and Bairn City skater Vezzani (Despicable V)" width="700" height="352"> Team Italy and Bairn City skater Vezzani (Despicable V)</p>
<p>Both Oliver and Vezzani in their past have represented Power of Scotland (both made the 2016 training squad), with Vezzani representing POS at the first MRDWC. Both have now decided that, going forward, they wish to represent other nations instead.</p>

<p>Speaking to Oliver about why he decided to try out for Wales he said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<i>My mum's side of the family are all from Wales and are passionately Welsh, even my Gran who was originally from Birmingham, so it was a bit of a no brainer to play for Team Wales when I got the chance. The last World Cup, I couldn't commit to traveling down to Wales for training regularly and flying to Canada, financially and work wise. Thankfully this time round I was in a position to be able to.</i>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
Vezzani has a similar story for Italy:
<blockquote>
<i>At the first MRDWC there was no Team Italy, currently in Italy there are really no Men’s teams/leagues. They do have the Woodgang, which is a team made up of skaters from all over Italy and a few other places. A little like how we had the Jakey Bites here in Scotland. When I tried out for POS for the 2016 World Cup there was no Team Italy, they only appeared very late in the day after I had already made the POS training squad.</i>
<p><i>When I didn’t make the final 20, quite a few people said to me about trying out for Italy instead. But because I had already made one countries training squad for that world cup I decided against it. Although when I watched and cheered on Italy at the World Cup I realised then, I really wished I had. At that point I decided that if I was going to try out for any Nation going forward it was going to be Italy.</i></p>
</blockquote>
We also asked both how friends, family and team mates reacted when they found out that they would be representing Wales or Italy.
<p>Oliver:
</p>
<blockquote><i>My Family have been really supportive about me playing in the World Cup for Wales, so much so that they are coming to Barcelona to come and watch. My mum's gone full Welsh fan-girl so expect lots of daffodils and dragons, lol. My team mates are pleased for me as well although a few wished I had picked Power of Scotland instead.</i></blockquote>
Vezzani:
<blockquote>
<i>When it came to trying out last year, I had told a couple of people that I had wanted to but never told anyone when I was actually going to do it. It was only when I played my first game for Italy in November last year (at the Road to Barcelona tournament in Holland) that everyone found out I had tried that also included 99% of BCR as I had managed to keep it a secret. </i>
<p><i>The response from friends and teammates has been fantastic and everyone has been really supportive. My dad is really proud and happy that I will be representing Italy and my sister seems to be the most excited by it all, even more than me. </i></p>
</blockquote>
We all know that at the previous MRDWCs, Scotland’s fans have become well known for their support, sheer volume, and chanting for not only for Scotland but other Nations they take a liking to.
Seeing as both Oliver and Vezzani are Scotland-based skaters, they will be hoping that they will get some support from the Scottish fans when they take to the track in Barcelona. Here at SRD, we do hope that the Scottish fans at Barcelona and back home will be celebrating and cheering on both of these skaters, and the Welsh and Italian teams.. at least, when they are not playing against Power of Scotland!</div>
