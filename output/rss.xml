There's also a bunch of open scrimmages across the world, especially in the UK; and in Chile there's an open-subscription variant rules event which looks quite interesting (and tiring...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile, in Scotland, we're raising money to fight cancer with the return of Charity Roller Derby Sevens tournament, Krustfest, for a second year, and in Spain they're holding a Roller Derby festival!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space. In this case, there's three Argentine events, because we really want to highlight how much exciting stuff is happening in Latin America right now.&lt;/p&gt;

In particular:
not one, but two Australian teams play in the first WFTDA Continental Cup of the season; and the first of two Playoffs for the Mexican National Tournament is held in Chihuahua over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also some high level action in London;  some international roller derby in Buenos Aires for the third weekend running; and a German Bundesliga D1 bout in Munich... plus a fantastic all weekend Bootcamp and officiating clinic in Malmö, Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

tournament event, &lt;em&gt;Chaos on the Clyde&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/884747741612081/"&gt;FB&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/17770"&gt;FTS&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120829101350/https://www.glasgowrollerderby.com/bouts-events/bouts-eventschaos2012/"&gt;WEB&lt;/a&gt; ). (This was also around the time that the National Museum of Roller Derby was getting going, and
so, as well as the international competition, the NMRD stall also helped to develop derby in different senses.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, thanks to the venue used being closed not long after, and other suitable venues being inaccessible, it's been 6 years now until Glasgow Roller Derby have been able to bring back the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Image of flyer for Chaos on the Clyde 2." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/07/Chaos2019flyer.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, back it is, with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/854543498244493/https://www.glasgowrollerderby.com/events-calendar/2019/8/17/chaos-on-the-clyde-2"&gt;Chaos on the Clyde 2&lt;/a&gt; hosted in GRD's regular venue of the ARC in late August this year!&lt;/p&gt;

However, there've been relatively few big "all-day all-round" bootcamps in the region, and, in particular, little for the officiating side of the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it was particularly exciting to hear that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://beijingrollerderby.weebly.com/"&gt;Beijing Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; was hosting a 1-day multi-discipline bootcamp over the Dragon Boat Festival Weekend (8 June) this year. Skaters from all three Chinese-region leagues - Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong - were present, for the all day event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Flyer logo for the Beijing Dragon Bootcamp event." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/07/Beijingbootcamplogo.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked to a few of the attendees for feedback on the event, which included everything from Skate maintenance and "what is Roller Derby", all the way through drills, communication skills, and a final modified-&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com/short-track-roller-derby-resources/"&gt;Short Track&lt;/a&gt; rules scrimmage.&lt;/p&gt;

We have a lot of derby happening across the world, including a three-day bootcamp in Estonia (covering WFTDA, Roller Derby Sevens and Short Track), and even more variant games in Australia, as South Sea Roller Derby host another Rainbow Lightning tournament (which is a ruleset we'd love to see people try in Europe sometime).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Scotland, New Town Roller Derby host a Charity LGBT scrimmage, to support West Lothian Pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

&lt;p&gt;With the 2019 edition of the Championships arriving very soon now, we thought it was time to catch you up on events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Mexico City Roller Derby held the #1 spot for the WFTDA-gender division, with Baja California's Baja Roller Derby coming a close second... can this year shake up the dominance of the Mexico City teams?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="map of mexico with teams competing in the Division 1 and Division 2 tournaments for 2019 marked with stars." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/07/mexico-2019-teams.png"&gt;
