Facebook's event search tools are not good at finding events unless they're physically close to you; and they've disabled or limited most of the ways of reading lots of data from their site. Instagram doesn't provide any way to search for events at all; and not enough leagues have websites with rss feeds or calendars that we can pull from to make this reliable. (And, whilst &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; games get listed on Flat Track Stats, not all do; and not all events are bouts, or bouts which are suitable for ranking!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd like to encourage leagues, again, to &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:scottishrollerderby@gmail.com"&gt;email us&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/scottish.rollerderby/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; message us, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/scottishrollerderby/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; message us (or join our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discord.gg/8CJPyjq"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; server and talk to us there) to let us know about your events; or tell us how to (automatically) track your calendars if you have them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd like to return to a few events we missed last weekend, though, just to restore the balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, in Uppsala, first fixtures of the Division 2 Swedish Nationals series for 2019/20 saw the hosts ( &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.uppsalarollerderby.se/"&gt;Jackdaw City Rollers&lt;/a&gt; ) compete in a round robin with Örebro's Nerike Knockouts and Sundsvall's Demolition Rollers, over 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/735468933551752/"&gt;[FACEBOOK LINK]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Flyer for the Seriespel Division 2, showing times and attendees." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/10/jackdawcityseriespel.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire event was streamed on the Sweden-based Solidsport platform, and at the time of writing, "replays" [saved copies of the stream] are available at: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://solidsport.com/uppsala-roller-derby/replays"&gt;https://solidsport.com/uppsala-roller-derby/replays&lt;/a&gt; although registration is required to view them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Uppsala&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Division 2 fixture is in the December, and sees Uppsala face Helsingborg's Helltown, the final member of the series; before the division completes in the new year for the final games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hosts of this event, Jackdaw City Rollers / Uppsala Roller Derby, are currently experiencing significant difficulties with their training venue, having had their practice times and halls abruptly curtailed at short notice. For more information, and to support them by signing a petition, go here: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mittskifte.org/petitions/rattvisare-fordelning-av-halltider-i-uppsala"&gt;https://www.mittskifte.org/petitions/rattvisare-fordelning-av-halltider-i-uppsala&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over in Brazil, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/capivaras.rollerderby/"&gt;Capivaras Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; (of Piracicaba) hosted a double header event with guests Gray City Rebels of São Paulo on Sunday. The Capivaras have been avoiding Facebook Events, so we missed this when it was just a flyer...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B22p2wWpEIt/"&gt;[INSTAGRAM FLYER]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Image of some of the action from the first scrimmage." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/10/Graycity.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Action from Brazil (Photo: Gray City Rebels)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Capivaras told us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This Sunday’s (09/29) Match, which happened in Piracicaba, a city in the countryside of the state of São Paulo, was a friendly mixed match between two leagues: the home team, Capivaras Roller Derby, and the Gray City Rebels, from São Paulo, the state capital. A large part of the refereeing team was also from São Paulo.
We held two mixed matches in order to provide the opportunities for all the skaters present. In the morning, we held a full-contact game with the debut of some players from the Grays and one from the Capivaras team, and in the afternoon a non-contact game with the return of some Capivara players to the track and the debut of some of the Grays' fresh meat!
More than a great opportunity to put players in the track and train their abilities in the game; the matches were also an opportunity to make new friends and strengthen the full potential of the roller derby in Brazil!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a significant event which deserves more coverage, although being wholly-North-American, it's outside of our self-imposed limit on highlights...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawai'i saw their annual Battle of the Islands event last weekend. This year, the event was hosted by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pacificrollerderby.com/"&gt;Pacific Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; (O'ahu), with teams competing from Maui Roller Girls, Garden Isle Renegade Rollers (Kaua'i), and the "Big Island Mashup Team" (representing Echo City Knockouts and Waimea W ), as well as the hosts themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/680267739053588/"&gt;[FACEBOOK EVENT]&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/111728"&gt;[FTS ENTRY]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as the main tournament, run as a 4 team round robin, the event also featured a Junior Roller derby exhibition bout by the Honolulu LeiOuts, and a closing Black v White scrimmage. The Friday before the tournament additionally saw an Officiating Clinic, for all visiting officials (referees and NSOs), run by the very well travelled Mass The Ref.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire tournament was also livestreamed on YouTube, and we link to the video in each game in the table (none of these videos are full-length, as far as we can tell).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scores were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the undefeated &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mauirollergirls.com/"&gt;Maui Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt; the Battle of the Islands Champions for 2019!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to bring you a detailed article on the state of Roller Derby in Hawai'i later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>brazilian roller derby</category><category>capivaras roller derby</category><category>gray city rollers</category><category>maui roller girls</category><category>mea culpa</category><category>pacific roller derby</category><category>roller derby hawaii</category><category>sundsvall roller derby</category><category>swedish roller derby</category><category>uppsala roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/meaculpa290919/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 07:55:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Weekend Highlights: 05 October 2019</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/highlights/2019/weekendhighlights-05102019/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting week for Scottish Roller Derby, with both Edinburgh's Auld Reekie, and Glasgow Roller Derby competing in international tournaments (ARRD in the Continental Cup in Helsinki, and GRD in the Kick Ass Cup in Hamburg). And, to add to that, this is the weekend of the annual Big Blether Scottish Roller Derby Conference, so all the leagues will be coming together there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also two-day international tournaments in Sweden, the Mexican National Division 2 Championships in Léon, Sudestada Roller Derby's debut bout in Necochea, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antes de que&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/fenix_rollerderby/"&gt;FENIX Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;organizara el próximo gran evento patagónico, un campamento de entrenamiento de 2 días dirigido por Tropical Mecánica de 2x4 Roller Derby, les pedimos que recapitularan la emocionante historia de la comunidad patagónica el año pasado.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En general es importante destacar que el Derby patagónico ha crecido muchísimo estos años gracias al trabajo fuerte que ponemos cada equipo. Me refiero a estos tipos de eventos donde podemos compartir en casa entrenamiento con una destacada jugadora del Team OSOM [del 2x4], invitando a los equipos que puedan sumarse a participar también, así ellos y nosotros nos capacitamos para seguir creciendo. En la provincia de Santa Cruz hay 4 equipos que vivimos a 400 km de distancia entre nosotros, por lo tanto jugar seguido es muy difícil porque implica mucho gasto económico.
El año de Derby patagónico empezó con un torneo en Ushuaia que tuvo un excelente nivel y por suerte fénix roller Derby de fusionó con erráticas de Calafate en un equipo llamado cruz del sur y pudimos participar. Después tuvimos un bootcamp en caleta olivia una ciudad ubicada a 600 o 700 km de nuestro río Gallegos, pudimos participar también, finalizando el encuentro con un partido mixto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En cuanto a actividad de nosotros fueron los únicos eventos a los cuales pudimos asistir. Para el año que viene tenemos proyectados más viajes para participar a nivel nacional en torneos grandes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In general, it is important to highlight that Patagonian Derby has grown a lot in recent years thanks to the hard work that we put in from every team. I mean, these types of events where we can share bootcamps at home with an outstanding player from [2x4's] Team OSOM, inviting the teams that can Join to participate as well, so they and we are trained to continue growing. In the province of Santa Cruz, there are 4 teams that live 400 km away between us, therefore playing often is very difficult because it involves a lot of economic expense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This year of Patagonian Derby began with a tournament in Ushuaia that had an excellent level and, luckily, Phoenix Roller Derby merged with Calafate's Erráticas in a team called "Cruz del Sur" and we were able to participate. Then, we had a bootcamp in Caleta Olivia, a city located 600 or 700 km from our Rio Gallegos where we could also participate, ending the match with a mixed match.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As for our activity, they were the only events we could attend. For next year we have more trips planned to participate nationally in large tournaments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>argentine roller derby</category><category>fenix roller derby</category><category>patagonian roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/09/fenix-patagonia-2019/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 19:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Weekend Highlights: 29 September 2019 (Sunday)</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/highlights/2019/weekendhighlights-29092019/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the Sunday (and Monday) addendum for the coming weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roller Derby has changed a lot since the revival in 2001; with age, and with the changing of the wider cultures in which it’s embedded, it's grown, shrunk, formalised, organised, reorganised, liberated and moderated in various ways in various places. We’ve gone from being some friends who skate together and have fun to being a sport with World Cups and World Championships, leagues on six continents and a growing Junior reach (all whilst still having fun).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The UKRDA logo, on a folded banner." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/09/UKRDA-1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UKRDA, like all of the Roller Derby “National Governing Bodies” has been part of that journey, but the role of National Governing Bodies hasn’t always been clear in our new and rapidly evolving sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2007, the group that would become UKRDA was nothing more than a Yahoo groups discussion board (some readers may not even remember that Yahoo ran such a service!); a place for the fifteen active leagues to coordinate, share advice, and work together to see how this Roller Derby thing could happen. Two years later, it had gone formal: naming itself the “United Kingdom Roller Derby Association”, to provide a democratic body that could represent the sport to all those structures that need an “organisation” to talk to. Slowly, as Roller Derby in the UK has grown, the UKRDA has evolved, taking on more responsibilities.
(To name a few: overseeing National Teams for the World Cups; supporting the development of British Championships; negotiating in a position of collective strength for insurance for leagues; managing grievances and complaints; upholding codes of conduct; standing up for leagues when they need support; supporting officials in development and training; and representing the sport to National and International media.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past month, it has taken another step, joining the German and Finnish NGBs in formalising a deeper relationship with the WFTDA. This collaboration may look like a simple letter, but the significance is so much more. In the face of other organisations, such as World Skate, who want to be seen as the leaders of roller derby, we say no. We acknowledge that this sport, our sport, is run by those that make it; the officials, the volunteers and the skaters. For this to continue to be the case, we have to put these procedures and agreements in place. These are important foundations, we're building a platform of NGBs working together with our global governing bodies - it's giving NGBs a clear voice in the future of our sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these significant changes and developments, the UKRDA continues to be a small team of volunteers. These volunteers are elected by member leagues and are governed by votes of those leagues. At times the UKRDA has been perceived as a "faceless bureaucracy", but in its simplest form, it is a group of volunteers who care deeply about the progression and development of Roller Derby. Our names are available on our website, we're real people who skate, volunteer and officiate at leagues across the UK. However, in the past year, online abuse and pressure have made the job even harder for this band of volunteers. We’ve heard more from people sending us abuse, than those wanting to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a crucial time for UK roller derby. The last 6 months, (or even 7 days!) have proved the value of clear, agreed on policies available for leagues as well as the importance of grievance and escalation processes. But we can’t do this alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have big plans. But we need more people to come on board to see these plans through. One of the priority projects for the UKRDA is to seek recognition from the Sports Councils across the UK as an NGB in our right - we can tap into structures, advice, support and potentially funding. We also need to review our grievance process to help ensure safe spaces. We want to foster the development and learning of officials through boot camps. We want to develop a UK wide safeguarding policy for roller derby that leagues can implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only so much a few people can do. You have the expertise of your sport, your leagues, your local areas. We need you to help us make all of these structures better, to support our sport and the people within it as well as we should. We're here being open and honest; the culture and actions towards URKDA need to change, and we need to change - this is where we need you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nominations for people to join the board of the UKRDA are open now. Without you, this won’t happen. We are only as strong as our member leagues and our volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an Extraordinary General Meeting on &lt;strong&gt;October 3rd&lt;/strong&gt; - if your league is a member we want you to be there. All of us make up the UKRDA, but more of us need to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK roller derby scene is amazing. We are writing this while at British Championships playoffs, at the end of the first day when we have seen the level of commitment and skill from leagues that ten years ago would have been visible at a WFTDA D1 team. The athleticism, the energy, the passion is there.  We're so proud to be a part of this incredible sport, and we hope this has given you an insight into our commitment to its development, and that we have heard what our members want. This is a step towards achieving that.&lt;/p&gt;

In the spirit of their project, this post is available in English, Italian and Friulan [click the language button at the left to pick a language]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Flyer for #whyIchooserollerderby project, image of Banshees on track, overlaid with hashtag and instagram icons." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/09/Banshees-Copertina.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everybody!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm Sugar Molotov from Banshees - Roller Derby Udine. We are a very small team in the rearmost region in north-east Italy and we are struggling to form a complete roster as many of us did or are still doing right now all around the world. We have all experienced the "roller what...?" reaction from people, and one day I thought: why is it so difficult to explain what's so exciting in this sport? How can I let them see and feel what I saw in Roller Derby and I'm feeling to this day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we decided to create a personal space on our social accounts (Facebook and Instagram) for every skater, ref, nso, or supporter to tell what they love about Derby and why they choose to play this amazing, thrilling and yet expensive and possibly dangerous sport, every day. We are all kind of very different people and still this brings us together in an unprecedented way, at least in my experience. This is how the &lt;em&gt;#whyIchooserollerderby&lt;/em&gt; campaign was born - of course we do not have as many followers as other, bigger teams would have, but we wanted to try it anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, space is a very important concept in Roller Derby so we put no limit: I asked my teammates to join this project, choosing a photo and writing whatever they wanted about it. I wanted them to feel at ease to share what they felt comfortable to. On the way I thought that it would be nice to have other people joining it as well, and here I am asking if you'd feel like joining us. We don't have much to offer in return, except that we'll treasure every single contribution as if it was our own. Every text is translated in three languages, Italian as it's our nationality, English because we want as many people as possible to read it and Friulano, which is the language spoken in this specific, small region of Italy and  we want to take part in the effort to preserve it. It's part of our identity as well. Also, one of our teammate translated hers in spanish since it's her legacy, and we loved that immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So! I hope I've given you a reason to join our small project in the hope to make it count in spreading the news there's a new world here, and it's like anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the addresses of our pages, the campaign has just started of course, but you can see how it looks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/bansheesrollerderby/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/bansheesrollerderby/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/bansheesrollerderby/"&gt;https://www.instagram.com/bansheesrollerderby/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for sparing some time for us,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar Molotov&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banshees Roller Derby Udine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Mosaic image showing all of the profile pictures of contributors to the project, in grayscale, with central hue-based tone mapping from the Banshees logo." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/09/Banshees-mosaic.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I wrote this letter when the campaign had barely started. It grew slowly but steadily and I really want to thank all the people who made an effort to keep it going: Enrico Comar and Mara Devincenti translated in friulano a few texts, but the majority were made by Enrico Gigante, whom we can’t thank enough. He’s always on the spot and faster than light! Thanks to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://arlef.it"&gt;ARLeF&lt;/a&gt;, the regional agency for friulano language and Francesca Battistutta from the regional counter for friulano language for the revisions. She also helped us a lot with this article and she’s invaluable to me for her cheerful self and  fierce friulano soul. All the graphics are made by Giulia Malaridotti (Woozy McWolf), our insomniac doggo-lover who send me edited pics at 3am in the morning so that I can publish them in time. English texts were reviewed by Chealsey Lynch (Marma Juke), our US blocker who’ll always be a Banshees in our hearts - we’ll miss you dearly. Special mention to my crazy fellow SMMs: Alessandra Menardi (Jackass Menny), Sveva Angelini (Freaky Pinball) and Alessandra Piermattei (Alycat), who believed in this project even when I didn’t and always had my back when I couldn’t keep up with the virtual world. Grrlz, you are simply the best. I could have never made this come true without you. Last but not least, the whole Banshees team who indulged in my whim and all the other fellow skaters and officials who took part in the project, sending us the most emotional, personal bits of their derby story. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

Sunday seems to be the preferred day for things in Latin America, with two events in Bogotá (including a collaboration exercise between 4 of the local leagues), one in Mexico, and the previously mentioned Patagonian bootcamp in run by Vendaval in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK, meanwhile is full of bootcamps and mini-bootcamps for all those not at British Champs over the weekend...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

Founded in 2017, before the last Roller Derby World Cup, they've been a great way for newer, or less visible National teams to be seen; and for raising awareness of the globally diverse nature of Roller Derby in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year was a particularly important point in the tournament's history, as two borderless nations - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/teamindigenousrollerderby/"&gt;Team Indigenous Rising&lt;/a&gt; (link to Facebook), and the new &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/jewishrollerderby/"&gt;Jewish Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; - competed in the tournament, and even played each other. (In fact, even the styling of the series of games as a true, all-day, tournament was a change this year, as previously there had not been enough competitors to realise this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking for Team Indigenous, Jumpy McGee explained the importance of this to both teams:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Team Indigenous is extremely grateful to have this platform to bring our teams together and highlight that not all humans are defined by borders or citizenship.  There are centuries of displacement, violence, and oppression that have occurred causing people indigenous to their homeland to create home elsewhere.  We believe it was critical then to create a space where players identifying as a member of a nation had a place to belong.  And when WE talk about nation, we're talking about nation in the sense of a collection of humans who have the same cultures, beliefs, languages and traditions who cannot be contained or defined by borders.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2019 Nations tournament was run as an efficient double-elimination bracket, with seedings voted on by the competing teams. This means that each team could lose once in the tournament - that loss knocking them out of the "winners" bracket, and into a sudden-death bracket against other teams with a single loss. The eventual survivor of that sudden death bracket, having proven themselves the best of the teams, other than sole unbeaten team, gets to play in the final against that undefeated remainder. In this case, for time, all games were single period WFTDA-rules bouts, except for the final, run as a full-length WFTDA-rules game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as the two borderless nations, there were also three Asian nations represented: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/teamphilippines_rollerderby/"&gt;Team Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/teamkorearollerderby/"&gt;Team Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and Team "Japan-fam" (so named because they did not have a tryout and offered this opportunity to all skaters of Japanese heritage). This is also an important aspect of the event, and has been since it began, with Philippines and Korea founding members in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Action from the Korea / Philippines game, Philippines jammer on inside line passing blocked Korea jammer in pack." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/09/TristanKing-KoreaPhilippines.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Action from Korea versus Philippines (Photo: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/TKvisualarts"&gt;Tristan King&lt;/a&gt; [see link for license])&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ShortStop noted for Korea, in particular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As a small nation, with relatively low representation in Roller Derby, [we] submitted an initial roster that included 8 Koreans, two skaters from OH Roller Derby Team (the only roller derby league in South Korea), and skaters from China, Vietnam, Thailand and Hong Kong. All of our non-Korean Asians are currently involved in building their own nations teams, and we thought it was a wonderful way to include them as start to gather their own teams.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Philippines' Electric PIRANHA, it's an equally strong, and personally important opportunity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have played sports throughout my whole life and have been playing roller derby now for four years. I never once in my life thought I would be able to represent a national team, a team that represents my heritage and culture. I had the opportunity to represent Team Philippines at the World Cup in Manchester and just recently in the Nations Tournament at RollerCon. Words cannot describe the feeling I get skating for Team Philippines. I am surrounded by smart, beautiful, athletic Filipinas. When we are together, there is an extraordinary and undeniable bond we have, like we've been skating together as a team for years when we only have had the chance to skate together a handful of times. We represent a country that has gone through colonization, war, and the fight for independence. I skate for my cultural heritage and I skate for my family. #pamilypirst #poweredbylumpia #poweredbyrice&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for Japan, where there has been derby in some form for more than a decade, visibility is low, as we've discussed before on this blog.
Kris Rago, for Japan-fam noted to us that this was a factor in their participation here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Japan Fam was unique in the sense that roller derby is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/rdjapan/photos/a.316960268326566/2053816941307548/?type=3&amp;amp;permPage=1"&gt;present in Japan&lt;/a&gt; and that some of our skaters from both Japan and Hawaii were able to fly over and join our U.S. Japanese skaters. It was really wonderful to be able to come together and work together to represent our heritage and do amazing things on the track. My hope is more opportunities like this will help to strengthen the relationship between our U.S. Japanese skaters and skaters and leagues in Japan.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Queensland's state tournament has its Grand Final this Saturday; as does British Championships, with their Playoffs deciding the winners in both divisions. There are several leagues celebrating reaching their 1st decade of existence in various ways, an exciting bootcamp in Cancùn, Mexico, and a lot of roller derby in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
