<p>Since our <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/10/26/short-track-roller-derby-a-first-scottish-test/">first article</a></strong> on <strong><a href="https://rollaskateclub.com/lets-rolla/">Short Track Roller Derby</a></strong>, back in 2018, the new ruleset has continued to spread, in almost all the places in the world where Roller Derby is played.
As such, we thought we’d follow up, just 4 months later, with some of the exciting developments in Short Track worldwide.</p>
<p>Firstly, as readers of <strong><a href="https://whataboutmagazine.com/">What A Bout</a></strong> magazine will already know, Short Track Roller Derby has spread further-and-wider than we could have hoped: to Russia, and Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, already. You should read the full article in WAB <strong><a href="https://whataboutmagazine.com/2019/01/20/what-a-bout-issue-3-winter-2019/">Issue 3</a></strong> for full details, but look out for several Short Track tournaments in Moscow, and other Russian cities later in the year. Dubai’s interest in Short Track has also led to bigger things which we’ll get to later in this article.</p>
<p>Short Track is continuing to enable more teams to play derby, even now.</p>
<p>In Poland, Gdańsk’s <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/551140512034275/">Chrome Sirens</a></strong> are playing their first ever public game, thanks to Short Track rules enabling them to put together two competitive teams (and use more accessible venues). This double-header event will be coming to the city in the middle of next month - March 16th!</p>
<p>In the Americas, Short Track Derby is also taking off: ruleset creators Rolla Skate Club having provided initial impetus with a comprehensive series of trial sessions across Canada and the North-west of the USA. In Latin America, meanwhile, there is interest in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in exploring the ruleset, as it solves several of the challenges of the many teams in the city.</p>

<p>In the USA, though, public bouts have already started, with the ruleset enabling teams to play their first games in years!</p>
<p>For <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/IVVRD/">Illinois Valley Vixens Roller Derby</a></strong>, who played their first public bout for 3 years thanks to Short Track back in February, the ruleset has been a revelation. Whilst some venue issues meant that they had to modify the track slightly, the bout was a complete success - despite only using word of mouth and social media for advertising, they managed to fill all the available seating. Speaking for the league, Lemon Squeezer told us : “We now know that a smaller track definitely does not mean less exciting or intense, quite the opposite! I can't remember a time I have heard a crowd this engaged before and the feedback from spectators was that they are looking forward to the next one and bringing friends. We also had several former skaters come to check it out that are now interested in coming back.”. 
I.M.GROOT added, “The fact that all players have to both jam and block really takes you out of your comfort zone. It pushes you to use all the skills you have learned, not just the ones you prefer. Short Track has the ability to really push skaters to be stronger, better and more adaptable in game play.”</p>
<p>In an even more striking mode, the USA has also brought us the first ever “Short Track” league: <strong><a href="https://www.pstrollerderby.com/">Pittsburgh Short Track Roller Derby</a></strong>, founded by a group of skaters who retired from “competitive” Roller Derby, but still wanted to play a friendlier version of the sport. Their league aim, as expressed on their website and Facebook page, “We are a group of friends who wanted to create a safe, stress free environment to get together and skate. Community over competition.” encapsulates the entire point of Short Track as a ruleset and community. (You can find out more about them on social media and their website.)</p>
<p>Further in the future, there’s also exciting news of potentially the first ever international Short Track Roller Derby Tournament.  The newly created <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/UAERollerDerby/">UAE All-Stars</a></strong>, the United Arab Emirates’ official travel team, are exploding onto the scene, and one of their first public plans is to play Short Track Derby! Formed of skaters from <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DubaiRollerDerby/">Dubai Roller Derby</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ADRollerDerby/">Abu Dhabi Roller Derby</a></strong>, the team plan to play all kinds of Derby, but Short Track is definitely a solid component of their goals. [We have more about UAE All-Stars themselves in another new article here, which we’re going to publish soon - and their first ever public game <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/495068457564329/">will be this weekend</a></strong>, 2nd March, in Hong Kong, as part of the Pan-Asian Spring Rollers].</p>

<p>Thanks to the support of <strong><a href="http://www.gogogent.be/en/home-default/">GO-GO Gent Roller Derby</a></strong>, who had been investigating hosting an experimental Short Track clinic for several months, UAE All-Stars will be travelling to Belgium on the 1st and 2nd of June. The first day will be a Short Track Roller Derby training workshop, allowing the experienced skaters from Dubai’s testing of the rules (and potentially other skaters who’ve tried Short Track from the rest of Europe) to explain and demonstrate the potential of the ruleset to attendees.  
The second day will be a tournament event: the structure of which is still under development. Teams are welcome to participate from across Europe, and we know that there’s been interest from several regions already.</p>
<p>Even further in the future, there’s the possibility of Short Track bootcamps in other parts of Europe, including the UK, and other plans afoot about which we can’t speak at this time. Stay tuned for further updates as they occur!</p>

<p>Previously on this blog, we've written about Waterford ViQueens' innovative use of the PivotStar rules to hold a fast, efficient and <strong>fun</strong> Roller Derby tournament in the south of Ireland: <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/05/21/viqueens-victorious-valhalla-a-test-for-pivotstar-rules/">LINK</a></strong>.
After the success of the initial tournament, where 6 teams from across Ireland (and also a single team from France) competed in a faster-paced event, Waterford are doing it again.</p>
<!-- wp:image {"id":27911,"align":"center"} -->

<p><img alt="Waterford ViQueens Logo" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/fb/waterfordviqueens.png" title="Waterford ViQueens Logo"><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/477884896068750/">Victory or Vahalla #2</a></strong> will be a <strong>WFTDA-gender policy</strong> tournament held in Waterford on the <strong>27th April</strong>, aimed at teams from around <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings/women/women_europe">FTS Women's Europe</a></strong>"&gt; rating <strong>400</strong> to <strong>500</strong>. </p>
<p>This tournament will be played under <strong>PivotStar</strong> rules, a variant ruleset developed to allow efficient production of tournaments with less load on officials. This shouldn't put anyone off - the main things that change are: <strong>skaters score 1 point per pass</strong> (not 1 per skater), there are <strong>no runbacks</strong> (track cuts and returns are relative to where you left the track, not relative position of skaters), and games are <strong>20 minutes long</strong> with no timeouts. 
This makes for a fun tournament event, with slightly faster play and different tactics than a WFTDA-standard bout.</p>
<p>This will be the first of several planned "non-standard rules" tournaments in Europe this year (there's at least two in Russia coming up, as well as one or two currently in planning), so we advise people to get in on the fun and not miss out.</p>
<p>Waterford is accessible for international travellers from the airports at Cork Shannon and Dublin, as well from the ferry terminal at Rosslare (for people travelling from Wales or France).</p>

<p>It's a new season for WFTDA competition, and with it we've had the first new official WFTDA rating for the season ( <strong><a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-january-31-2019/">https://wftda.com/rankings-january-31-2019/</a></strong>)
Throughout the year, however, those ratings and rankings will change - not just as the teams play more games, but also because the weighting of their past games will alter. Games will "age out" of the rating if they become more than 1 year old; and games which become more than 6 months old will count only 50% as much.</p>

<p>Speedy Convalesce, Head NSO of Mannheim's Delta Quads, as well as many other things, is here to help us better visualise what's likely to happen at Playoff selection, however. This ongoing series will report the ratings and rankings of the top 100 WFTDA teams, calculated as <strong>if we were at June 30th 2019</strong> [the ranking which will be used to decide Qualifications and seedings into both WFTDA Playoffs, and the Continental Cups].
Whilst we can't predict the future, this will give the best guess of what teams need to do to qualify, based on what they've already done.</p>
<p>As well as attaining a minimum ranking, teams also need to play at least 4 bouts within the eligibility period (December 2018 to June 2019), and we'll be tracking their progress on this measure, too.</p>
<p>The list: (# is number of bouts contributing to the ranking, whilst #El is the number of bouts contributing to their eligibility for playoffs). We'll colour teams to indicate when they've played their minimum number of games for eligibility, but as yet, it's too early for anyone to have met this. We've eliminated any teams which have played less than 2 games since July 2018 here.</p>

<!-- /wp:table --><p>[We plan to update this list each time WFTDA release a rating and ranking until Playoffs selections] </p>
<p>As you can see, the re-weighting isn't just a technical thing, it produces real effects, visible at the very top of the table. For now, the focus on "more recent games" helps to push Rose above Victorian in our rating here; but these closely matched teams are likely to jostle a lot as the year progresses.</p>

<em>Editor's note: due to burn-out, and the increasingly obnoxious changes on the Wordpress backend, our end of year feature content has been delayed. We'll be releasing it over the next few weeks as we complete it. This is the first item in this content. We apologise for the delays incurred, and will update you all on the future of SRD when we know what that is.</em>
<hr>
<p>With the growth of Roller Derby worldwide, there has also come increasing regional organisation. Since 2010, and especially since the first Roller Derby World Cup in 2011 focussed thoughts on National structures, a number of nations, and nation-like entities, have begun organising various "National Tournaments" within themselves. At SRD, we consider these to be as important as any other large scale tournament - such as WFTDA or MRDA events - especially as they can also be more inclusive than such series due to reduced travel costs and membership requirements.</p>
<p>As such, we'd like to highlight the winners of each such tournament series we're aware of in 2018 - and briefly cover the tournaments themselves. As a historical resource, we also host a summary of all of the winners of the tournaments (and some references for them) here: <a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/NationalTournaments.html">National Tournaments (2010-)</a>
</p>
<h5>We'll start with the two largest such events (it's hard to judge which is larger, as they have exchanged places on various metrics year to year):</h5>
<hr>
<h4>UK&amp;Ireland ("<a href="https://www.britishchamps.com/">British Championships</a>")</h4>

<p>British Champs has been running since 2015, and has made various changes to its structure over the years (the most recent to improve inclusion and accessibility). It is structured as a multi-tiered divisional system, with each "skill level" tier divided into one or more geographical "divisions"; teams promote/relegate between tiers between seasons. Since 2016, Champs has officially run parallel tournaments for WFTDA- and MRDA- conforming teams, and has also allowed competition from non-A teams.</p>
<p>In 2018, the WFTDA-side tournament winners, topping Tier 1 convincingly were: <strong>Central City Roller Derby (Birmingham), </strong>not only winning every game against their opponents, but also achieving a significantly higher points difference than the second spot team, Liverpool.
2018 has been a good year for Birmingham teams, as the city's other team, Birmingham Blitz Dames, also hosted the first ever WFTDA Continental Cup in Europe later in the season.<strong></strong></p>
<p>The MRDA-side tournament  was topped extremely impressively by <strong>New Wheeled Order (Manchester M)</strong>, also delivering a huge points-difference advantage over second place Tyne and Fear. New Wheeled Order have had a very good few years, and we expect even more from them in 2019.
</p>
<h4>France ("Championnat de France Roller Derby")</h4>
The French National tournament series is, like the similarly sized British Champs, organised into Tiers by strength, and also loosely divided into geographical regions. (Unlike British Champs, there is competition across regions within a tier; also unlike BC, the Championnat is run directly as part of the French NGB, the FFRS.) The Championnat de France has <em>Feminin</em>- and <em>Masculin</em>- parallel tournaments; some leagues submit teams to the tournament which differ from their Travel teams, and the relaxed structure of the tournament also allows for "combined" team submissions from cooperating leagues. Unusually, compared to many of the other tournaments listed here, the French Championnat is fitted to the French sporting season (roughly following the European school year), and so starts in the previous winter, and finishes in the early summer each year.
<p>Repeating their victory in 2017, <strong>Nothing Toulouse (Roller Derby Toulouse)</strong> retained the French Championship this year. They remain one of the few non-WFTDA member leagues to hold a Championship position in their home country.</p>
<p>Undefeated champions since the Championnat started in 2016, <strong>Quad Guards (Toulouse M)</strong> continued their streak for another year in 2018.</p>
<hr>
<h5>Whilst the French and British tournaments are the largest, they are not the longest running National tournaments. Next, we're going to cover the longest running tournaments in modern Derby, the four which started in 2012:</h5>

<h4>Sweden (Swedish Roller Derby Seriespel)</h4>

<p>The Swedish National Tournament,  . Like larger tournaments, the Series is split into tiers ("serien"), with the Eliteserien being the top tier. More recently, Elite tier teams have been allowed to differ from the Travel teams for their league. There is only a WFTDA-gender tournament in Sweden, to date.</p>
<p>In 2018, <strong>Crime City Rollers (Malmö)</strong> retained their Championship title for the third year running, placing them one more victory behind Stockholm's streak of 4 wins (from 2012 to 2015).
</p>
<h4>Finland (Suomi Cup)</h4>
Finland's National Tournament is structured rather like the Swedish version, including the tendency of Elite tier leagues to submit non-Travel team rosters to the tournament. For the first time, in 2019 the Suomi Cup will be open to non-Finnish teams (making it an interesting extension of "National"), as St Petersburg Roller Derby A, the White Night Furies, compete.
<p>For the first time in 2018, <strong>Oulu Roller Derby</strong> achieved the Championship title, breaking a run of alternating wins by Helsinki and Kallio over the previous 6 years.</p>
<p>[Northern Finland also holds its own tournament - the Pohjola Cup - which started the tradition of welcoming non-Finnish participants in previous years via St Petersburg. So, in some ways, it sets the trend for its higher-profile southern relative.]
</p>
<h4>Mexico (Torneo Nacional de Roller Derby)</h4>
Mexico's National Tournament series has been organised by their national governing body, the Asociación Mexicana de Roller Derby, since it began in 2012. We've covered the leadup to the current season on the blog previously here: <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/07/18/mexican-national-championships-2018/">Mexican National Tournament article</a>. The series consists of a series of playoffs, selected by rating/ranking in the Mexican league tables (which work using the WFTDA rating scheme), with two divisions. As with many other nations, there are "varonil" and "femenil" parallel tournaments, corresponding to WFTDA- and MRDA- policies.
<p>In 2018, <strong>Mexico City Roller Derby</strong> retained their title for a three-year streak of victories, despite</p>
<p>In the Varonil side of the tournament, <strong>Disorder Roller Derby (Mexico City M)</strong> also began a streak, retaining their title from 2017.
</p>
<h4>Colombia</h4>
Whilst Colombia has run a National Tournament since 2012, the series has had a somewhat more complex past than the others in this category, with a couple of restructurings, and a hiatus from 2015 to 2016. In its current form, the Tournament consists of two parallel series - a multi-fixture tournament for Bogotá's many leagues (the "Torneo Distrito"), and a separate one for teams in the rest of Colombia (the "Western Region" tournament), with the top teams from both then competing at the Torneo Nacional finals. (<a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/08/01/the-5th-colombian-national-tournament-2018-so-far/">We've written more about the 2018 series here.</a>)
<p>2018's Champions, <strong>Bogotá Bone Breakers</strong>, also retained the Bogotá title in 2018, as well as continuing a three win streak in the national series (albeit across that 2 year gap).</p>
<hr>
<h5>Slightly less venerable than the oldest tournaments, but not in the size rank as Britain and France, our next grouping also covers a large geographical area.</h5>

<h4>Brazil (Brasileirão de Roller Derby)</h4>

<p>Brazil's national Championship, the Brasileirão, is a single-fixture event at present, which started as least as long ago as 2013 (there's some evidence it started earlier). Due to the distribution of teams in the country, it's semi-invitational, although the highest rated teams in Brazil always attend. (<a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/10/11/the-brasileirao-brazils-national-championships-at-8/">We've written more about the history of the tournament here.</a>)</p>
<p>2018's Brasileirão winners were <strong>Gray City Rebels (São Paulo)</strong>, retaining the title from 2017 (and resisting Ladies of Helltown's attempts to take back the title from 2016).
</p>
<h4>Chile (Torneo X / Torneo X-Men)</h4>
Chile has one of the youngest National Tournaments in Latin America, with the first Torneo X beginning in 2015. Year on year, it has gained more participants, and has had to change structure multiple times to accommodate this, currently using a playoffs and finals structure. For the first time in 2018, B teams have been allowed to compete, enabling Chile's strongest (and only WFTDA-member) league, Metropolitan Roller Derby, to compete with its Bayonetas.
Since 2017, there has also been a MRDA-gender tournament, the Torneo X-Men, run in parallel, and loosely associated with the original WFTDA-gender event.
(<a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/07/26/chilean-national-championships-2018-torneo-x-returns/"><strong>We've covered an intro to this year's Torneo X earlier on the blog.</strong></a>)
<p>For the first time ever, 2018's winners are a B-team: <strong>Bayonetas (Metropolitan B | Santiago)</strong>, taking a fairly commanding win in the final bout.
In the Torneo X-Men, which finished earlier in the year, <strong>Terror S-Quad (Santiago M)</strong> were victorious for a second time in a row.
</p>
<h4>Germany (Bundesliga Roller Derby)</h4>
The German National Tournament, or Bundesliga, formally started in 2015, as a multi-tier tournament run by the German NGB, Roller Derby Deutschland (RDD). In this form, its history has been tracked by Derbyposition.de since the beginning; the structure is much like the much larger French and British tournaments, but without the need for multiple geographical divisions, due to its smaller number of teams. (There were two previous events which might count as "German National Tournaments", in 2010 and 2013, but they are not part of the modern event.)
As with several other National series in nations with very high rated WFTDA-member leagues, those leagues have begun sending "non-Travel teams" to represent them in the tournament.
<p>For the first time in the tournament's history, <strong>Dresden Pioneers</strong> comprehensively won the Bundesliga Division 1 in 2018.
</p>
<h4>Australia (Australian National Tournament &amp; Australian Men's Nationals)</h4>
Unusually, Australia has not had a formally denoted "National Tournament" for WFTDA leagues (although you could claim that the Great Southern Slam counts, given the scope of its attendance). The Australian Men's Roller Derby organisation, on the other hand, has organised an Australian Men's Nationals since 2015, as a single fixture tournament towards the end of the year.
More recently, an unusual "State-teams" style National Tournament has been launched (for the first time in 2018), with WFTDA- and MRDA- gender legs, but we're not sure if this counts as a National tournament in the same sense as the other events in this list.
<p>In 2018, <strong>Victoria Men's Roller Derby</strong> won the Australian Men's Nationals, having lost it for the first time ever in 2017 (to Tasmania!).</p>
<hr>
<h5>For our final grouping, we have another eclectic selection of Nations, all united in having run a National series for 3 years or less.</h5>

<h4>New Zealand (Top 10 Championships)</h4>

<p>New Zealand's "Top 10 Championships" have been running since 2016, although information on the second year of their organisation is a little patchy due to website bitrot. In general, the series is a flat round-robin style event, distributed across the year, with no tiering or geographical structure. As far as we are aware, there's only a WFTDA-gender version of the tournament so far.</p>
<p>In 2018, <strong>Dead End Derby (Christchurch)</strong> won the Top 10 Championships for the first time (ending Wellington's Richter City's streak of 2 years).
</p>
<h4>Spain (Campeonato Nacional de Roller Derby)</h4>
The Spanish National tournament is a single event affair, due to the relatively small number of potential competitors in Spain at present. Organised by the Spanish National Governing body, the single tournament sees the top teams in the country play for victory in a single elimination structure. The event has run since 2016, with an additional MRDA parallel event introduced in 2017.
<p>In 2018, <strong>Roller Derby Madrid</strong> continued their unbroken win streak since the start of the competition.</p>
<p>Similarly, 2018's winners in the other division were <strong>MadRiders (Madrid M)</strong>, also continuing an unbroken win since last year.
</p>
<h4>Austria</h4>
Austria's National tournament only started in 2017; before then, there was effectively only one sufficiently developed team in the country (Vienna Roller Derby), and so no way to hold such an event. Due to the small number of teams, the Austrian National Championship is a single fixture event; and due to the dearth of MRDA teams, it has only a WFTDA leg.
<p>In 2018, <strong>Vienna Roller Derby</strong> retained their title from 2017, although competition within the rest of the teams was strong, Vienna have a significant experience advantage in their country.
</p>
<h4>South Africa (National Derby Fest)</h4>
South Africa have held a National Championship event since 2016, although that first event included "home teams" from some of the leagues involved. As South Africa has very few leagues with travel teams, this event is a single fixture which also focuses on developing the sport within the nation. (<a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/10/31/south-africas-national-derby-fest-2018-three-years-of-festivals/">We've written more about the history of the event here.</a>)
<p>In 2018, Johannesburg's <strong>Golden City Rollers</strong> retained their win streak since the dawn of the tournament.
</p>
<h4>Belgium (Roller Derby Belgium National Tournament)</h4>
Finally, we come to the newest National tournament in our list: Belgium. The Belgian national tournament, organised by rd.BE, the Belgian NGB, ran for the first time this year, as a year-long series of round-robin fixtures within tiers. (Initial tiers were drawn from FTS Europe ratings.) From the start, the rd.BE event has had a WFTDA- and an MRDA- leg.
<p><strong>Antwerp Roller Derby (One Love Roller Dolls)</strong> are the first ever holders of the rd.BE Championship title.</p>
<p>In the MRDA leg, Brussels' <strong>Manneken Beasts</strong> achieved the first ever Championship.</p>
<hr>
<h5>Special mention:</h5>

<h4>Japan (Derby Nights 4x4)</h4>

<p>Whilst it's structure is rather different to every other event in this list, we should note that Japan has also had a Tokyo-series first for the first time in 2018. The Derby Nights 4x4 ("DN4x4") series was a multi-fixture event with "womens" and "mens" legs, open to leagues of all affiliations in Japan. (As such, the women's division included both the World Skate/FIRS affiliated Spiral Cats, and all of the WFTDA-affiliated leagues in the Tokyo metropolitan area, from Tokyo Roller Derby to the independent Kamikaze Badass.) This was a unique ruleset, with, we believe, 4 skaters per competing team, and very short period and jam lengths.</p>
<p>In 2018, <strong>Neon Roller Monsters</strong> (the submitted team from Tokyo Roller Derby) won the women's division.
The new-in-2018 team, <strong>Tokyo Bar Hoppers</strong>, won the men's division (which had only 2 teams this year!).</p>
<p>We're excited to see what happens with this tournament format, and if it expands beyond the Tokyo region to the rest of Japan.</p>

<p>Continuing our series of guest posts, we're keeping topical with a review of Namur Roller Girls' league management web app, TrackKarma by Glasgow Men's Roller Derby's Rosie Peacock.<br><br><strong><a href="https://www.trackkarma.com/">TrackKarma</a></strong> is completely free to use*, although it can only be used as a web application (there is no self-hosting option). The self-reporting on the website says that, at the time of publication, 376 leagues are currently using the service. At present, the service is available in both English and French, and has no user limits.</p>

<!-- /wp:separator --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Trackkarma (TK) is an app (well, a website that runs like an app) developed by Namur Roller Girls.<br>Their launching blurb is as follows….<br>“Ever dreamed of teams charters, training sessions, attendance, league agenda and directory all gathered in one single tool?<br>Here it is: TrackKarma, the application that will change the world (or at least your league).<br>In TrackKarma, members can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Manage their player profile and import a cute picture</li>
<li>Check monthly agenda of games and training sessions</li>
<li>Inform of their absence at practice</li>

[For a review of such options, we recommend <strong><a href="https://medium.com/@shredinger/software-tools-for-nonprofits-f2cc73deea49">this article</a></strong> - Ed]<br><br>We have been trialling TrackKarma for about 3 months now and these are my thoughts:<br>I am a terrible technophobe, and I find TK very easy to use. <br><br>It makes sense and I don’t feel stupid using it (yey!). <br><br>It is incredibly useful for keeping record of training sessions, games and attendance; however, like most ‘extra’ bits of work we ask skaters to do on top of training, some folk are using it really well, and others haven’t logged on at all.<br><br>Initially we asked everyone to be responsible for updating and maintaining their own attendance, but this was a bit optimistic on our part and so now we ask coaches to update skaters’ attendance after each session they coach.</p>

<i>We don't normally comment on current events in roller derby on this blog. However, the current shocking events in the UK Roller Derby community have been spreading rapidly, and we felt it would be useful to have an objective location collating the information available. In the past 24 hours, there has been a lot of discussion and horrified reaction, and many responses from across the community; we would not want these to be missed. </i>

<p>The UK roller derby community has been shocked this week by revelations that a female NSO appeared in court to answer sexual offence charges.</p>
<p>Laura Nixon-Corfield (known within the community as Sara Tonin) was sentenced after admitting to having and distributing images of child sexual abuse.

<p>Nixon-Corfield had NSO’d and THNSO’d a number of events, working with leagues in both the UK and global community, including the 2017 MRDA Championships in Wales, and National and International tournaments in the current year.</p>
<p>Leagues and organisations Nixon-Corfield has been affiliated with in the past published statements that detailed lifetime bans from leagues and events. Their statements unanimously stated that they were unaware that she was going through any legal proceedings, and did not know that she faced sexual offence charges relating to children.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/RainyCityRollerDerby/posts/10156449538209681">In a post on Rainy City Roller Derby’s Facebook page</a>, league president Evan Lawrence said: “The Board of RCRD wants to reassure the derby community and the public that we treat the safety of our members and fans incredibly seriously and on discovering this information we have taken immediate action.</p>
<p>“They have been immediately removed and banned from the league, permanently banned from our venue, and any events at which Rainy City is participating.</p>
<p>“We have notified WFTDA, UKRDA, JRDA and British Champs and we are working with them to make sure that we are able to provide a safe space for everyone within the community.</p>
<p>“We are providing counselling for all our members and will also be consulting with local expert organisations for further advice on how to support the league and the derby community.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterRollerDerby/posts/2119046081488805">Manchester Roller Derby made their own post,</a> explaining that while Nixon-Corfield had previously been a member, they had left the league some time ago, although she had still NSO’d at some of their events, as a local official.</p>
<p>The statement, in part, reads: “Manchester Roller Derby condemns their actions in the strongest possible terms. The safety of our members, their families, the wider derby community and anyone else who may be in attendance at our events is of the upmost importance to us and a priority for the league.</p>
<p>“We find it deeply regrettable that they continued to participate at our events despite having reported themselves to the authorities and despite consciously attending events where junior skaters were present.”</p>
<p>It continues: “In light of the above, and as a safeguarding measure, Manchester Roller Derby have issued a permanent lifetime ban to prevent Laura Nixon-Corfield from attending any Manchester Roller Derby related activities or events.”</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ukrollerderbyassociation/posts/2237443319621953">the UKRDA has issued a lifetime</a> ban from any events organised by a UKRDA member league, including British Championships. They also join the long list of entities which have contacted the WFTDA, MRDA and JRDA on this matter.</p>
<p>British Championships also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BritishRollerDerbyChamps/posts/1011802455673545">issued their own statement</a>, confirming that Nixon-Corfield had been banned permanently "from participation in all WFTDA, MRDA, UKRDA, JRDA, and British Championships events and groups effective immediately." and affirming that "We are unified in our condemnation of these disgusting and harmful crimina<span class="text_exposed_show">l act". </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nottinghamrollerderby/posts/2325725211005984">Nottingham Roller Derby</a> confirmed that they have no ongoing relationship with her.</p>
<p>There is currently an ongoing process in several organisations concerning improvements in safeguarding and vetting procedures to limit the possibility of this occurring again, and to help protect children in future.</p>
<p><i><strong> </strong></i>Update: the MRDA has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1963676190376371&amp;id=114448265299182">also issued a statement</a>, revoking Nixon-Corfield's registration, and banning her worldwide from their events. All MRDA leagues have been informed of this decision.</p>
<p>Update (2): the WFTDA has now also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10156889296479111&amp;id=88510014110">made a short statement</a>, also confirming a WFTDA-wide ban, and affirming support for, and solidarity with, their member league Rainy City.</p>

<span class="s1">We’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <span class="s2"><b><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">Flat Track Stats</a></b></span> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <b><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></b>.</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <b><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></b> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). (SRDRank also has recent WFTDA rankings, including the 31st June ranking, as well as SRDRank, and allows you to make predictions from them.)</span></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>Statistically, this is, of course, not a problem, but the position is still counter-intuitive to some members of the community. Some blame the specific construction of the WFTDA rating system itself, whilst others simply believe that Tournaments should supersede mathematical methods for determining rating. <br>As a result, every year when the WFTDA Championship winner does not automatically become the WFTDA #1 rated team, the question of "how good are WFTDA Ratings?" is raised again.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>In the spirit of this, we decided to actually test this, rather than just complaining about an aspect of the rating we didn't like. <br>Using Flat Track Stats' records of all Roller Derby bouts, we selected the entire history of all WFTDA Sanctioned bouts in the history of the sport, all the way back to 2005. Using these, we calculated what the ratings and rankings would look like now, if we used various methods for rating teams.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system"><strong>"Elo" ratings</strong></a>, named for Arpad Elo, who developed them initially to rate performance of Chess players, are a particularly easy kind of rating to implement. As a base comparison to our other ratings, we wrote a very quick Elo rating for WFTDA Sanctioned bouts, based entirely on Win/Loss records: the rating does not care how much a team won or lost by, just that they <em>did</em>.<br><br>We'll compare this to three other ratings:<br><strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">FTS (WFTDA)</a></strong>: the Flat Track Stats rating, as optimised for WFTDA Sanctioned bouts. FTS is also an Elo rating, although its updates take into account the degree of success, not just that a team won; it also has a couple of other factors to account for things like home team advantage. <br><strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRank.html">SRDRank (v2)</a></strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRank.html">:</a> this blog's in-house rating scheme. We've <strong>written</strong> a lot about this before, but it's essentially an entirely different kind of rating scheme to Elo; rather than updating pairs of teams on each game, SRDRank is a <em>Massey-style</em> scheme, which tries to produce consistent ratings to explain all of the games in its "purview" at once. This version of SRDRank was optimised for monthly predictions, against the world, not just the smaller subset of WFTDA Sanctioned games.<br><strong><a href="https://wftda.com/category/rankings/">WFTDA</a></strong>: the official WFTDA rating and ranking, which is used to rank teams for selection into the official WFTDA tournaments. WFTDA ratings are specifically designed to be "easy for people to understand" without specialist knowledge, as well as, presumably, aiming to reflect the history of performance of their member leagues.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

<h4>Predictive accuracy</h4>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>The key conflict between expectations of Rating systems and the reality, is often one between "prediction" and "postdiction".</p>

<p>"<em>Prediction</em>" is, of course, using a rating to guess what a future result would be, by comparing the ratings of the competitors previously.<br>"<em>Postdiction</em>", conversely, is using a rating to judge "how well" two teams have performed, over their recent history.</p>

<p>Whilst it may seem that the two are closely related, in fact, it isn't inherently true that a rating which has high accuracy at one is also highly accurate at the other. In general, prediction is harder than postdiction - it's always hard to guess what's going to happen beforehand - but for teams whose strength has varied a lot over their season, it also can be hard for a postdictive approach to represent their "overall performance" in a satisfying way.</p>

<p>In neither case, of course, does "high accuracy" mean "always places the winner of a particular tournament at #1". All rating systems are statistical, and try to produce the best overall measure of performance, for all teams, and all possible contests. The difference between the top teams is just as relevant as those between the middle and lowest rated teams.</p>

<p>Equally important to the accuracy of a rating - at either task - is the frequency at which it is updated. Elo ratings, including the FTS ratings, are designed to update every time a game happens, so their accuracy can be measured either side of a given result. Some other ratings are published less frequently - WFTDA's ratings are monthly to bimonthly, depending on the time of year, and SRDRank is <em>designed</em> to produce predictions no faster than daily. Frequent ratings aren't necessarily the "best" ratings, especially for postdiction - a "long-term overview" can sometimes produce a better overall view of historical performance than a rapidly updated one focused on bout-by-bout changes; but for prediction, especially in the middle of tournaments, it's usually best to have all the most recent information available for your next bet.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, we've plotted the performance of four different ratings, at both postdiction and prediction, when we take updates at yearly, quarterly, monthly, fortnightly, and "bout-by-bout" intervals. For some rating schemes, not all intervals were available: FTS doesn't easily provide "historical rating" collections for anything more frequent than quarterly results. (We have a single data point for the FTS "bout-by-bout" period, for prediction, thanks to Ioan Wigmore.); WFTDA ratings are not updated faster than monthly at best; SRDRank doesn't produce "bout-by-bout" updates for this kind of data.</p>

<p>In all cases, the postdiction accuracies (as percentage "correct") are shown by triangles, and the prediction accuracies by circles; the same colour is used for a given rating scheme. More "rapid" updates are to the left of the graph.</p>

<!-- wp:image {"id":27847} -->

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="2018/12/screen-shot-2018-12-10-at-22-28-40.png" alt="" class="wp-image-27847"><figcaption>Success rates for prediction (calling games ahead of time) and postdiction (representing performance after the fact) for 4 rating systems, with different time bases.</figcaption></figure><!-- /wp:image --><p>The first thing that should be clear is that postdiction is, in general, easier than prediction: <em>every</em> rating has a higher postdiction accuracy than prediction accuracy, for every update period.</p>

<p>The Elo rating has some of the highest postdiction accuracies, partly because it responds "fully" to every win or loss: a win counts 100%, even if it was a narrow victory, so each result pulls the rating around strongly, making it reflect history. This tendency to be "recency-biased" also explains why its postdiction gets "better" on shorter updates: a "weekly" postdiction only has to represent the last week of play accurately, and that's what Elo is best at. When we need the Elo rating to represent an entire year of performance, its bias towards the most recent month harms it overall.</p>

<p>That same effect, also means that the Elo rating is also the worst at prediction: because it counts all wins equally, a single narrow upset can throw off any trend it was measuring.</p>

<p>SRDRank and FTS are closely matched for the update periods where they can be compared, with SRDRank having a slight advantage in prediction, and a noticeable one in postdiction; by comparison, the WFTDA rating is worse than all other ratings at postdiction, except on the yearly scale, and only better than the Elo rating at prediction. SRDRank is particularly good at "yearly review" postdiction: representing the entire year's performance overall; this is because of design decisions which mean that it considers an 18 month period of games in order to make its rating evaluation. The same "long term" view means that its postdictions are worse at reflecting "short term" history than the recency-focused Elo, although it still out-performs every other metric at this task.<br>The WFTDA rating, meanwhile, is hampered by having a maximum amount it can respond to any "strength change", meaning that it struggles to keep up with the more performant ratings on postdiction; and its simple rating calculation is not sophisticated enough to predict well.</p>

<p>For prediction, the "sports prediction" literature generally considers accuracies above about <strong>70%</strong> to be excellent. On that measure, only two ratings are excellent for Roller Derby prediction: SRDRank (fortnightly or weekly updates), and FTS ("bout by bout", although it is likely that it would also be excellent on the same timescales SRDRank is). It is likely that better than 75% or so win/loss prediction accuracy is impossible for Roller Derby: there are always closely-matched games which "could go either way", which even an accurate algorithm will guess wrongly about half the time by definition.<br>We should also say that, by this measure, the WFTDA rating isn't that bad at all, only just missing out on that 70% benchmark, although it's not in the same class as the other two schemes.</p>

<p>For postdiction, there are less expectations on excellence, as the difficulty is partly dependant on how "variable" the sport is. The ~85% accuracy attained by Elo (quarterly or shorter) and SRDRank (yearly) is exceptional, however. The WFTDA rating actually does fairly well at "yearly" postdiction - summarising the years' performance in a single measure - but it is worse than every other metric when applied on a more frequent basis.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->

<h5>Predictive Accuracy (with close misses)</h5>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>As we mentioned above, simply judging a rating on its ability to call wins and losses causes problems when evaluating close games. A good rating will predict that a close bout will be close; but inevitably, random chance will cause it to be wrong about which one of the contestants will actually win.</p>

<p>There are several ways in which we can correct for this issue: we can move to measuring the success at predicting actual score-lines (not just winners and losers), but this is hard to compare for our metrics (mainly as the Elo rating isn't designed to predict score-lines); or, we can give credit to the rating for results it gets wrong<em> if the game was close, and the rating predicted it to be close.</em></p>

<p>[As an aside: SRDRank was actually optimised against the first metric: getting score-lines as close as possible, for the entire world's history of games.]</p>

<p>As an example of how this changes our evaluation of ratings, we've graphed the accuracies of the Elo and SRDRank ratings again, for both pre- and post-diction. This time, we've included a second set of points for each: the success measured, including games which the rating called the winner wrong, but correctly predicted the result to be close either way (within 10% on the scoreline).</p>

<!-- wp:image {"id":27850} -->

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="2018/12/screen-shot-2018-12-11-at-13-14-51.png?w=700" alt="" class="wp-image-27850"><figcaption>Success rates for prediction and postdiction for 2 rating systems, including successes on calling close games as close (regardless of who won).</figcaption></figure><!-- /wp:image --><p>As you can see, including "close games" results in a significant boost to our evaluation of all the metrics, although it does not "reverse the order" of any of our ratings in terms of relative performance. (Notably, SRDRank's yearly postdiction now narrowly beats all comers when you include close games, even defeating Elo's best postdiction with close games.)<br>Although we did not include them on the graph (in order to make the graph still somewhat readable), we'd expect similar gains for the FTS and WFTDA ratings; an average of around 2% additional "successes" for each test.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->

<h5>Best Rating for a Job</h5>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>Given the metrics above, we can attempt to select the "best" ratings to use for a particular task. We've selected four representative tasks, and mapped them to the mode (pre- and post-diction) and "timescales" on which they operate, to select recommendations, and warnings, on the approaches you should consider.</p>

<p><strong>Season Review</strong> is the task of summarising, as best you can, the overall performance of the field over the past season. This is a postdiction task, on a long timescale (six months to a year). This is also a very closely contested task, and there's not much to call between all 4 ratings.</p>

<p><strong>Medium-term Prediction</strong> is the task of predicting results several weeks to months in advance, to plan tournaments and games.</p>

<p><strong>Play-by-Play Prediction</strong> is the task of predicting results on the minute, judging your next game at a tournament, for example. </p>

<p><strong>Medium-term Review</strong> is the task of summarising, the overall performance of the field, on the scale of months. This is the "coaching" metric, when judging how well your team is evolving. For this, second place is very tight.</p>

<p>We can also (bearing in mind the relative expectations of accuracy, as discussed in the rest of this article), generate the full "rankings" for all of the WFTDA member leagues for 2018. (The WFTDA Ranking here is the one from 30 Nov 2018, the most recently available ranking and rating from WFTDA).<br>We present here the top 20, with ratings, from each scheme - notice that, despite the differences, there are far more similarities than disagreements.<br>(Ratings are <em>truncated</em> for space: the error introduced by truncation rather than rounding is much smaller than the expected error on the ratings themselves, so this is not an issue.)</p>

<!-- /wp:table --><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --><h5>All WFTDA Leagues (graph, image)</h5>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>As we've previously discussed, however, strict rankings are a bad way to represent the performance of teams. It's much better, even with 1-dimensional ratings, to report those ratings, providing a better measure of the "distance" between teams, than to imply that all teams are equally "1 better" than the team immediately "below" them in ranking.</p>

<p>As such, we've generated a graph of all the teams rated by at least one of our ratings in their yearly review. We order the teams in "WFTDA ranking" order, with teams not in the official WFTDA ranking placed at the end. <br>In order to provide a good comparison, we've rescaled all the ratings to represent logarithmic relative strength, compared to the "top" team in the rating*. (That is: for every "1" difference in rating, the better team is expected to score about 2.7× as much in a game; for every "2" difference, 2.7<sup>2</sup>× (7.4×), for every "3" difference, 2.7<sup>3</sup>× (20×) and so on.)<br>This image is unavoidably large in order to be legible; click the preview to get the full-size version.<br>Note that the full range of the entire rated cohort for all ratings is about <strong>8</strong>, corresponding to the top 3 teams being expected to score around <strong>3000×</strong> more points than the bottom 3 (or, effectively, a complete shutout).</p>

<!-- wp:image {"id":27849} -->

<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="2018/12/rating-performance-sheet3-crp.gif" target="”_blank”" rel="”noopener" noreferrer><img src="2018/12/rating-performance-sheet3-crp.gif?w=700" alt="" class="wp-image-27849"></a><figcaption>All WFTDA Member Leagues, displayed in WFTDA 30 Nov 2018 order (with extras not in that rating appended after), with all their ratings. (Ratings scaled to the same type for direct comparison.)</figcaption></figure><!-- /wp:image --><p>It's worth noting that, in general, there's still a reasonable agreement on the overall "shape" of the rating; the ratings all broadly agree on the strength difference between the top and bottom ends of the list, and whilst there are disagreements in order, there's also a lot of agreement about the overall place of most teams.<br>It's also possible to see how the "difference in skill between ranks" changes: the steeper the slope of the curve, the more change there is in relative skill as you change ranking. For WFTDA Member leagues, there seems to be a relatively flat middle section, where adjacent teams are actually very close in strength; at the top end, there's a much steeper rating change with rank, until the curve flattens again around the top 3 or 4. (All the ratings pretty much agree that Victoria and Rose are near-tied in the top 2, they just disagree about which is a tiny sliver ahead.)</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>We've given an overview and test of the official WFTDA rating scheme, versus 3 contenders for a range of use cases.<br>Contrary to some complaints, the WFTDA rating scheme turns out to be a pretty good rating, for post-diction, on the longer timescales. <br>More sophisticated schemes do better than it at almost all tests, but its performance, given its simplicity and the trade-offs it makes to try to prevent high-skill teams playing low-skilled teams for blowouts all the time, is acceptable.<br>Also, this test run underlines just how hard it is to make gains in predicting (or postdicting) game results: the gap between the worst and best performing metrics in this test is never more than 10%, and the gap between the "good" ratings tends to be around the 1% level. <br>We do note that, for prediction, Flat Track Stats attains class-leading performance, especially on short time scales. (It is just as good when rating European teams, MRDA teams, or any other region where it has an actively calculated rating.) We'd encourage regions which do not have their own rating scheme to contact Flat Track Stats to host such a thing for them. (The other benefit to this is that you have a place to store all your results: Flat Track Stats is also a public repository of all the game data which is uploaded to it.)</p>

<!-- wp:separator -->

<hr class="wp-block-separator">
<!-- /wp:separator --><p>*WFTDA estimated strength differences are calculated using the predicted strength ratios in the WFTDA algorithm, <em>not</em> the predicted "points gained". Other calculators use the points-gained formula, as they're interested in seeing how the rating <em>changes with results</em>: we're interested in how strong WFTDA's rating <em>actually</em> thinks teams are, which is different. (The fact that these <em>are</em> different for WFTDA is why sufficiently strong teams can't play weak teams without losing overall rating: points gains doesn't keep pace with strength difference. None of the other rating schemes in this article have this behaviour.)</p>
