<p>Last,but by no means least in the World Cup team roundup we have Australia.
Roller Derby is really well established in Australia,there are almost 80 leagues that are well supported by both fans and the media, many leagues regularly feature in their local press, radio and even on tv.There are regional competitions and many Australian skaters are no strangers to large scale bouts,having played at the likes of The Great Southern Slam.</p>
<p>Final Roster:
Amykazee,Bambi Von Smasher,King Cam and Short Stop <a href="http://canberrarollerderbyleague.com/">Canberra Roller Derby League</a>

<p>The sheer size of the country and the cost involved in travel means that Team Australia have not played any warm up bouts or been able to have the entire team together for any practise time.However,many of their skaters are from experienced and well established leagues and may not need much time to gel as a team,plus they will be eager to show everyone that down under Derby is a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p><em>Image courtesy of Roller Derby Brazil</em></p>
<p>Roller Derby is a brand new thing in Brazil,all their leagues were formed in the last year or two and if you were to add up all the Brazilians involved in Derby,it would come to less than 200 people.Getting recognition for any sport that isn't Football in Brazil is like pushing custard uphill,as a result practise venues and sponsors are hard to come by and many of the Brazilian leagues practise outdoors.That is not their only difficulty,items like skates and wheels are another obstacle,due to high import taxes in Brazil,skaters can expect to pay up to three times the cost price to have them delivered from outside the country.Despite all this,there are already ten leagues across Brazil and i suspect the national team appearing at the World Cup will inspire others to start their own leagues or join the existing ones.</p>
<p>Team Roster
Brazil have somewhat oddly opted not to have derby names,but among their skaters are
Brazilian Bombshell of <a href="http://www.sbderbymizfitz.com/">South Bay Derby Mizfitz</a>
Brazilian Nut of <a href="http://www.gothamgirlsrollerderby.com/">Gotham City Roller Derby</a>
Matadora of <a href="http://www.rollergirlz.de/index.php">Stuttgart Valley Roller Girlz</a>
the rest of the squad come from <a href="http://sldg.com.br/">Sugar Loathe Derby Girls</a> , <a href="http://ladiesofhelltown.wordpress.com/">Ladies Of Hell Town</a> , <a href="http://graycityrebels.com/">Gray City Rebels</a> and <a href="http://capitalcityderbydolls.wordpress.com/">Capital City Derby Dolls</a></p>
<p>Coaching staff
Head Coach: Lyon Aragão-Sugar Loathe Derby Girls.
Assistant Coaches: Denis Araki-Ladies Of Hell Town.
and Ju Leal-Gray City Rebels.</p>
<p>Information is a little hard to come by,but as far as i can find out Team Brazil have played no warm up games,in fact ,it would appear that no league in Brazil has actually bouted yet!So,playing at the World Cup will be their first bouts,international skaters aside.Those first two games will be against Sweden and Canada,which will make for a pretty steep learning curve for them.
Team Brazil have seemed to have the most difficult journey to Toronto out of the participating teams and potentially are the team that will learn the most from the experience.</p>

<div>Following on from last month's inaugural diary entry by <a href="http://nastynessiesrollergirls.wordpress.com/">Nasty Nessies</a> chair Irn-Bruzer, here's her nomination for December: the striking Nat-orious Red, causing our article title to become rather alliterative.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2011/11/nat600x800.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-606 aligncenter" title="Nat-orious Red" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2011/11/nat600x800.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="720"></a></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>What first attracted you to Roller Derby?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>I was looking for a way to get fit but at the same time have fun! I found out roller derby was coming to Inverness and just jumped at the chance to join. I had heard about it before but never really thought I would be able to do it (I'm super clumsy!), now I don't know what I was worried about, it is the best thing I've ever done and the girls are all amazing. We are all like minded and just want to skate.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>How did you chose your name? I guess your first name is Natalie...</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Yeah it is.. I had lots and lots of ideas but I just couldn't decide between them all, I managed to narrow it down and finally picked one but, of course, I changed my mind again after a few weeks when I thought of Nat-orious Red: it seemed more fitting in account of my bright red hair!</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>What was your biggest initial difficulty?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>My biggest difficulty was getting over the fear of falling! (I know! I know!  silly it's roller derby your gonna fall!) but the first few weeks I didn't and because of that I was too scared to go faster or try anything other than the basics, finally one lovely practice day I took a really hard land on my butt and that was not as bad as I imagined it would be. I fall or stumble a lot more now and it doesn't bother me it just means I'm trying harder...</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>I find it hard to stop talking about derby; it's always a talking point for me so anyone I meet hears about it whether they like it or not. Thankfully most people love it so that's good.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/ done this month?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>The most important thing I've learnt is probably getting my endurance up: I never realised just how unfit I was until I had to skate for a longer time than normal or when I tried my 25/5<a>.</a> My first attempt I got 25 in 5.09, which is better than I thought I would get but still not good enough so practice! practice! practice!.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>What’s new in NNRG?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Well we had our first bootcamp last week courtesy of the lovely granite city girls, they really helped us perfect a few things showing us their techniques and it was extremely helpful.</div>
<div>Also we are having a fundraising bake sale this Sunday with a lot of the girls ( myself included) making lots of scrumptious goodies.</div>
<div>And last but not least we have been given a sponsorship deal with the Rileys sports club! Which is absolutely amazing: we are all super excited about it. So it's been a pretty good month for us, we have achieved quite a bit and we are sure next month will be just as good.</div>

<p></p>
<p>Congratulations, you've been selected to play for your league in your first bout.</p>
<p>It is nerve-wracking and exciting all at the same time. You've worked so hard to make it on to the team and you deserve it.</p>
<p>Hopefully you'll be lucky enough to have experienced skaters on your team with you, if not, then you are all in the same boat. Don't panic. Preparation is key. Read the rules, and ask questions about anything you are unsure of. It will save you penalties in the long run as you'll understand how to avoid then and if you do pick any up, why you got them in the first place. Watch other teams tactics at games then go and introduce them to your team. Every team does things slightly differently and it can help to see a more experienced team play.</p>
<p>Breathe.</p>
<p>It certainly is an exciting time, and now is definitely your time to prove yourself. All eyes will be on you, the opposition have never seen you skate before, they don't know what to expect. Be confident in your ability, you wouldn't of been picked for the team if your team captain didn't believe you could do it. If there is anything you are unsure of, anything at all, ask. Chances are captains have heard it all before so will be able to help, and if they don't, they'll find out. At training sessions, try and play all positions to get a feel for them. Line-up managers always start with a few line-ups thought out but they usually get binned depending on how the game is going and what the team needs. You need to be able to play with everyone on your team. Get to know them on and off track. It is a well known fact that teams that get on well away from training play well together on track.</p>
<p>Breathe.</p>
<p>Pay attention at training. Make notes if you need to afterwards and read them to get the theory of the tactic into your head, then when you go on track again, the knowledge of what to do will already be there. Make sure you understand why you do certain tactics depending on what is happening in the jam. Don't be afraid to ask questions, you aren't expected just to know these things without ever having been taught it.</p>
<p>And finally......</p>
<p>Enjoy it. Don't get too caught up in the nerves, self-doubt, fear of injury. You've prepared well for this day and so has your team. Go out there and play to the best of your ability. That's all anyone can ask. Get a good nights sleep the night before and pack your kit the night before with everything you think you might need. The basics you definitely need to pack, skates, knee pads, elbow pads, wrist guards, helmet, mouthguard, skate tool, tape, scissors, water, fruit, team t-shirt, boutfit plus anything else you want to pack.</p>
<p>Have fun and hit them in the tit. I'll see you on the track.</p>

<p>While the Scottish Roller Derby Blog couldn't manage to fly anyone to Toronto to cover the World Cup in all its glory, Scottish fans are not going to be bereft of updates from Canada.</p>
<p>Glasgow Roller Girls' Mona Rampage and Sykes are planning on covering the World Cup themselves, with video interviews and other items posted to their YouTube channel, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SquareWheelsTV">SquareWheelsTV</a>.</p>
<p>Only 2 hours after their arrival in Toronto, there's already a first video up, so go ahead and follow them for more exciting updates.</p>
<p>At the moment, a poll is also open for viewers to select questions to put to the skaters that Mona and Sykes corral, so this is also an excellent time to make your voice heard!</p>
<p>(The Team Scotland Google+ page will also be linking to SquareWheelsTV videos as and when they are posted.)</p>

<p>Roller Derby has been around quite a while in New Zealand, The <a href="http://piratecityrollers.com/index.html">Pirate City Rollers</a> are the countries oldest league,founded back in 2006,they are quite possibly the oldest league in the world,outside of the USA and have recently been accepted onto the WFTDA Apprentice Program.The Pirate City girls are no strangers to international competition,they were the only NZ team to play at the Great Southern Slam,the first Asia/Pacific region Roller Derby tournament in 2010.As you can see from the team roster,close to half the squad is drawn from from Pirate City.</p>
<p>Team Roster
Pieces of Hate (Pirate City Rollers) – Player/Coach
Fia Fasi Oe? (Pirate City Rollers) – Player/Assistant Coach

Tuff Bikkies (Richter City Roller Derby)</p>
<p>Elle Qaeda (Pirate City Rollers) – Manager</p>
<p>Team New Zealand have played a Probables Vs Possibles bout as a warm up,much like Team Scotland Vs Team 'Steve' and also held a fundraising Skate-A-Thon in an effort to fund their trip to Toronto.
Given that there are national and international competitions in and around New Zealand,we can expect their skaters to be unfazed with a world stage,alongside Australia,they are something of an unknown on this side of the world,which is doubtless something they will wish to correct.
New Zealand is a team to watch out for,they could well provide an upset or two in the World Cup and will be excellent opponents for Team Scotland's first bout of the competition.
