<p>Fierce Valley Roller Cubs are recruiting!  Scotland's first junior roller derby league will be holding a fresh meat taster session on Sunday 24th April, from 13:30 - 14:30, in the Mariner Centre, Falkirk.</p>

<p>FVRC welcomes boys and girls aged 5-17, with no previous skating experience necessary.  We can provide kit to borrow for the session, with the exception of a mouthguard and helmet, so there is no commitment.  The taster will cover basic skating skills, most importantly, how to stop and fall safely!</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7044" src="2016/04/new-skater-banner.jpg" alt="New Skater banner" width="851" height="315"></p>
<p>The taster is designed to let new skaters try roller derby – with no commitment – to see if this is the sport for them. FVRG welcomes anyone aged 18 and over, no previous skating experience necessary.<span id="more-3116"></span></p>
<p>During the session, participants will be buddied up with an experienced skater to learn the basics of skating (and stopping!) safely. Buddies will also loan their equipment for the taster. At the end of the session, the coaches will provide an overview of FVRG and what they do, and will answer any questions that anyone may have about roller derby.</p>
<p>New skaters will then be welcomed into a dedicated training program for beginners led by FVRG coaches. Once they progress through their training, regular assessments will be held to give the opportunity to climb the ranks into Intermediate, then Advanced training sessions.</p>
<p>If you are interested in joining Fierce Valley Roller Girls and are aged 18 or over, please complete the <a href="http://www.fvrg.co.uk/get-involved/join-fvrg/" target="_blank">Registration Form</a> to reserve your place in this taster session.</p>

<p>As <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/PowerOfScotland">Power of Scotland</a></strong> continue on their road to Calgary, they gave the Scottish Roller Derby Community a chance to step into their world last weekend and share their skills, drills and only a few minor spills by hosting a fundraising bootcamp in Dundee. Keen to see exactly what the guys could offer, I snapped up a ticket as soon as they went on sale, and I'm fairly certain that I wasn't only person who was excited to see exactly what was on offer as there was a tremendous turn out.
Unless you have been living under a derby-proof rock, you will be very aware of the <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/02/15/power-of-scotland-fundraising-for-calgary/">amazing efforts</a></strong> from the whole squad to ensure they arrive in Calgary ready to take on the other participating nations. They've raised money any way they could, from bungee jumping, beard shaving, scrimmage, coaching and selling merchandise at games across the country and now bootcamping (it's a word now).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460057323219.jpg"><img title="wp-1460057323219" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460057323219.jpg" alt="image" width="1200" height="800"></a> (Photo: <a href="http://lauramacd.co.uk/roller-derby-photography/">Laura MacDonald</a>)</p>
<p>The reason I am so excited by this bootcamp and possibly why I was asked to write this was my enthusiasm for the fantastic planning and flow of the whole day. These guys didn't throw this together overnight. They even had print-outs! I mean who doesn't love a bit of literature to look back on?! The whole squad pulled together and they really delivered.
The first part of the day was led by the wonderful Nuke. Now, Nuke is a lovely bloke and a fabulous skater to watch and I was very keen on learning from him. Leading the day with agility and footwork he put us through our paces and he stripped everything back to basics - I learned loads. I've skated since 2011/2012 and I had no idea that since mins I had forgotten how to step without my wheels rolling (Don't make me do mins again). The highlight, however, may have been Nuke's tartan leggings &lt;3
Next up we had the lovely Blockbeard with his jamming skills session. Despite the name, everything he went through was very easily transferable to blockers. He broke the session down into evasive, attack and “Blammer” techniques - he really didn't hold back. His session led on from Nuke's agility session perfectly by incorporating the control and agility we had just learned. With an added technique on moving blocker twice your size with just a wee nudge. Thanks Pal!</p>
<p>Two solid hours of skating and it was time for lunch and an audience with Optimus Grime, Power of Scotlands very own Viking looking, hard hitting, softy. Those who know Grime, know that he has a background in bodybuilding. Who better to take us through a strength and conditioning seminar with bonus print-outs (I think he has surplus and may as well share). Highlighting some of the confusing things about weight training for performance and making it so easily understood was an incredible addition to the bootcamp. I already mentioned how much I loved the format and this for me was a very welcome aspect to incorporate in. Most people think that just skating will get you where you need to be, but Grime makes sure you know exactly how a little weight training will help improve your game even further, also talking a little about nutrition and the right things to eat pre and post-game/training. The chair demonstrations were also absolutely fabulous. [Editor's note: Optimus Grime's accompanying Mental Strength presentation was cut from the bootcamp due to time, but we have managed to <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/04/07/guest-post-mental-strength-with-power-of-scotlands-optimus-grime/">publish a copy here</a></strong>.]</p>

(Photo: <a href="http://lauramacd.co.uk/roller-derby-photography/">Laura MacDonald</a>)</p>
<p>Fuelled up and ready to get back on skates our final session before the mixed scrim was led by Skate Plisken. This session was on effective offence. Plisken took us through a few offence techniques that we have all seen performed by the POS guys recently at scrims and they were most definitely effective. Including the beautifully named “Sausage” technique; I sincerely hope no sausages were offended ( HA!)</p>
<p>The day wasn't quite over yet; there was still a scrimmage to be had. We had 1 hour to test out everything we had learned over the course of the day with 2 members of POS being gifted to either side as Bench and LUM. Prior to the scrim Nuke and Plisken, who were LUM and Bench for Team White, sat us down and went over basic Scrim strategy. This was excellent; not only were newer skaters getting the chance to scrim but there was also time to talk about strategy, which we all know doesn't come easily. I'm not sure I can express my love for this bootcamp any more than I already have without sounding like a raving loon.</p>
<p>Throughout every session the boys were on hand to observe, advise and sometimes join in. The day was full of laughs and smiles but no one was holding back. Those who attended skated hard and gave it everything they could. Absorbing all of this information, everyone was eager to take it back to their home leagues and try it out - myself included. I had such a huge buzz from whole day and have been internalising everything I learned since.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460057355236.jpg"><img title="wp-1460057355236" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460057355236.jpg" alt="image" width="1200" height="800"></a> Righteous Oxide drills the referees in their parallel bootcamp. (Photo: <a href="http://lauramacd.co.uk/roller-derby-photography/">Laura MacDonald</a>)</p>
<p>But there was a whole separate side to the bootcamp that I cannot forget to mention, even though I wasn't a part of this side of things I know just how valuable it is to the derby community.
Up in the balcony of the hall there were both a Ref and NSO school going on. Led by Righteous Oxide (Dundee Roller Girls) and Fairy Nuff (Auld Reekie Roller Girls) the Refs were in excellent hands to advance through their Refereeing career, with sessions on positions, communication, and Head Referee responsibilities. It must have been amazing because they did a brilliant job during the scrim.
The NSO section was Hosted by Alix ( Dundee Roller Girls) and Peggy Krueger ( Auld Reekie Roller Girls) with sessions on NSO positions, communication, people management and Head NSO responsibilities. From what I hear it was amazing and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it.
It is absolutely imperative to the sport that we have Refs and officials available and the fact that POS were able to accommodate absolutely everyone was truly amazing. Skill levels did not matter to these lads, everyone had a place and they made it a complete success. I think I can speak for everyone when I say thank-you, POS for hosting such a fabulous bootcamp, for sharing your knowledge, kindness and to wish you all the best of Luck in Calgary.</p>

<p>The recent <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/753462044787328/">Power of Scotland Bootcamp</a></strong> was a huge success, but unfortunately time pressure meant that <strong>Optimus Grime</strong>'s <em>Mental Strength</em> presentation (a complement to his <em>Physical Strength</em> seminar) was cut.
For posterity, and to provide everyone with its benefits, Grime has written it up and graciously allowed us to publish it.
The below is all Optimus Grime's work (including selection of images, although the images themselves are the work of others, and credited appropriately).</p>

<p>Mental Strength:
It starts with a dream:
Conceive - A dream to achieve a goal. A dream to become something you can be proud of. Whether the goal is big or small is not important, as long as it IS important. It must mean something significant to you.
Believe - Thoughts .....become.....things. You must think about what it is you want and believe 100%, without any doubt that it is achievable. Doubts......will .......delay ......dreams.</p>
<p>Achieve - For a goal to be a successful, a plan on how to achieve that goal must be made.</p>
<p>Questions need to be asked. How do I get there? What must I do? How long will it take? Who do I need to learn from? IT IS ABOUT THE REMOVAL OF VARIABLES. Variables lead to detriment, distraction &amp; even destruction. Questions are variables and once all the questions are answered, the journey can begin.
It's about creating a foundation:</p>
<p>For a body to become proficient at something it must be practiced &amp; built up from a foundation. The same applies to the mind. Treat your mind like a wall or building. The first brick in your foundation is a dream. It is the root of achievement.</p>
<p>This initial brick in your foundation must be strong. To do this a decision has to be made. You have to decide to commit to this dream and with that endeavour to not quit on it until it is completed. Decision is an extremely difficult thing to do. It is scary, new and takes a huge effort, but in a way it is wonderfully frightening. Once the decision is made, the rest is much easier.</p>
<p>Decision is incision. To decide is to cut off the chance of being deterred or distracted away from completion of your goal.</p>
<p>So just DECIDE. (Variable eliminated).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460021066618.jpg"><img title="wp-1460021066618" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460021066618.jpg" alt="image" width="960" height="540"></a> (Photo: <a href="http://lauramacd.co.uk/roller-derby-photography/">Laura MacDonald</a>)</p>
<p>The Mind of a Building:</p>
<p>From this point on you must think in a certain way. Think of the following metaphorically.
This starts with outlook and the words you use. It progresses with building on your foundation using metaphorical bricks. This ends with success &amp; achievement. Each brick represents a new skill and/or success. Each brick is a new happiness. Once a brick has been laid, it is enduring, immovable and timeless. It is here to stay.</p>
<p>Outlook:</p>
<p>Forget the terms positive and negative. Nothing is negative. There is only learning &amp; growing. All "negative" experiences are now lessons. "Every failure can only teach me. Every success will only make me grow and become more than I was". Adding "yet", changes everything. "I can't do that.....yet!".</p>
<p>"Forget the little feelings" - little feelings are the pieces of inner monologue</p>
<p>We have that tells us, "we're tired, we can't be bothered, we can do it later". Identification of the little feelings is very hard. We as humans live by feelings that our body and mind perceive; hunger, thirst, pain, cold, warm, sadness, excitement etc. Our lives are dictated by our sensations. So learning to prioritise the essentials and ignore the non-essentials is key to keeping my mind as strong as a building.
Identify and don't listen to the little feelings. (Variable eliminated)</p>
<p>Scenario-ize:
Think of all the things that scare you with regards to your dream. List them. Think about all the things that can go wrong with regards to your goals. List them. Feelings of negativity &amp; emotional turmoil arise happen...through shock of the unexpected.</p>
<p>So we Scenario-ize. We go through the list of what we fear and what can go wrong;
Injury, defeat, abuse, pain, losing, ineffectiveness, anger - and we pretend internally that it has really happened. We go over the situation and tell ourselves how we want to behave/react.</p>
<p>"If someone hits me illegally, i will keep my cool and keep on track with my team"
"If someone yells at me, i will not take it personally nor let it effect me"
"If someone does better than me, it doesn't mean I was in anyway bad. It only means I have more to do"
"If I foul out, I will respect the decision and not argue it. Then analyse my performance after I have supported my team and been respectful to those around me".</p>
<p>Mental preparation and practice, prevents poor performance and promotes positive prognosis. (Variables eliminated)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460021074061.jpg"><img title="wp-1460021074061" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460021074061.jpg" alt="image" width="1080" height="720"></a> (Photo: <a href="http://lauramacd.co.uk/roller-derby-photography/">Laura MacDonald</a>)</p>
<p>Learning &amp; Growing:</p>
<p>Not if....but when these negative situations occur &amp; you have successfully behaved how you planned, its time to learn.
Analyse. "What went wrong? Who's to blame? Why did it go wrong? How do I ensure this doesn't happen again". Ask these questions and learn from their answers. Let the learning fuel you to work hard to prevent this happening again. New variables will always arise and some old ones may come back. Scenario-ize these too and view them only as more lessons.
(Variable eliminated).</p>
<p>The little victories:
With every failure will come a few small or even tiny victories. Focus on them. When you are the underdog or out numbered with a high likelihood of failure, play for the little victories."We held that amazing jammer for 30sec"
"I got 1 lead jammer over someone far better than me"
"I finally used that thing i learnt at training and it worked"
"We were expected to lose by 100 and only lost by 50"</p>
<p>No matter what happens, good or bad nothing will detriment me. Be prepared to lose but also get ready to win.
(Variable eliminated).</p>
<p>Growing:</p>
<p>The mini victories are bricks too. The mind is built with stones of all sizes. For every achievement my wall gets bigger. For every success my building only grows.
Every brick makes my mind stronger. They are skills, they are happiness and they are esteem.</p>
<p>3 bricks forward, 1 brick back:
"Don't get too high".
Consider the idea of numeracy. We as humans love numbers. "I have £200. I lost 3kg. We won the last 2 games. I scored a 30point jam". Using this theme and if we  allocated points to our success bricks, we will start to accumulate points. If each brick represents 3 points we will eventually over the course of time build up a lot. Success breeds success. The more we achieve.....the more we achieve and the more we want to achieve. However, with success come a few poisonous characteristics that CAN cause our building to crumble.</p>
<p>Selfishness, arrogance, vanity &amp; looking down on those considered weaker etc.
The points acquired are your points and for you to do as you want with them. So consider that if I use all 3 point to always climb high and feel better about myself,I may topple. "My ego was my down fall. My head got too big. He/she/they are amazing, but they are arrogant dicks". 2 to move up and one to step back..... and reflect.</p>
<p>The best heroes are the humble ones. "They were incredible &amp; it was amazing how DOWN to earth they are". Be that hero and view the points as things to be rationed.
If I start at ZERO 0, my first success will give me 3 points with a potential score of 3. But! If i only use 2 and put 1 away for something else, i am still at 2 and still higher than I was at the beginning. Then over time, I will grow as my bricks add up. i will grow slower but, more stable. I will not get too high, I will NOT poison my wall with ego, arrogance and vanity &amp; I will aim to be of use to others.</p>
<p>(Variable eliminated).</p>

<p>Sharing is caring : I grow, we grow:
"If you want to succeed quickly go alone. If you want to succeed forever, go together"
The effect you have on others is the most valuable currency there is. Life is built in teams. My family team. My relationship team. My work team. My friend team. My health team....my derby team.</p>
<p>"2 points for me &amp; 1 for you".</p>
<p>As a metaphor, use 1 of those points that was for your growth that was stored away and give it to someone else. Use it to fuel their need.</p>
<p>Compliments, praise, gifts, smiles, congratulations, feedback, encouragement. Be that humble hero and lift those up around you. Reflect on your needs, but also your teams needs. Recognise who could do with a boost emotionally. What do they need that your talent can provide? Succeed, Grow &amp; Give back, as there may be someone in your Team that will need it more than you do.</p>
<p>The final variable:
Mental strength is about control. Control of your own mind, thoughts, ideas and emotions. Mental strength is about controlling and eliminating variables that may be of detriment to your minds. 'The final &amp; uncontrollable variable is other people'. Not everyone will have the same goals as you, or be as strong or as driven as you. Drive and strength are variable. There is nothing anyone can do to change that. We can only gently influence those who are involved in our journey to be as positive as we are. Set an example. "Monkey see. Monkey do"</p>
<p>So Scenario-ize the reactions of other people. Pretend in your head the eventuality they will react negatively. Then plan what you can do to help them &amp; prevent them being of detriment to themselves, to others and to you.</p>
<p>Focus on:
○Avoiding the little feelings
○Their little victories
○Scenario-ize with them (prior)
○Share your defeats &amp; successes together.</p>
<p>(Variable eliminated).</p>
<p>The Body &amp; the Mind:
One will always effect the other. Neither is more or less important than the other but they both need the same due care.</p>
<p>If my body becomes stronger, I will perform better and grow the success bricks for my mind.</p>
<p>If my mind becomes stronger I will eliminate variables that would deter me to try new things in my skates or exercise my body more.</p>
<p>Become balanced. Become more. Become awesome.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>In addition to their passion for all things derby, a handful of LDD skaters have a new found lust for ramps and aggressive quad skating.  On <strong>Sunday 24<sup>th</sup> April</strong>, Lothian Derby Dolls are excited to be hosting a Quad Skate Night at <strong>Transgression Park</strong> in Midlothian.</em></p>
<img class=" wp-image-6950 aligncenter" src="2016/04/12321707_525422107661960_6255470024138098836_n.jpg" alt="12321707_525422107661960_6255470024138098836_n.jpg" width="430" height="607"><p><span style="line-height:1.7;">A few members of Lothian Derby Dolls have been spending time at the local indoor skate park over the last few months, pushing themselves out of their comfort zones by getting to grips with skating on an uneven surface and learning new skills and tricks at the same time.  Some have mastered bowls and drop-ins already!  And it’s pretty impressive.  </span></p>
<p>In collaboration with <a href="http://www.transgressionpark.com">Transgression Park</a>, LDD are hosting the very first Quad Skate Night at the venue.  It promises to be a fun and social event, bringing the roller derby community together for a bit of banter and an opportunity to have a go at something a bit different.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6957" src="2016/04/12565422_10153252438310025_8112855549625087405_n.jpg" alt="12565422_10153252438310025_8112855549625087405_n" width="960" height="960"><em>LDD's Sam-Awry getting some air</em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.chicksinbowls.com">Chicks In Bowls</a> </em>was the idea driven by Lady Trample of the Pirate City Rollers, Auckland, New Zealand.  The aim is simple; to inspire people to strap on a pair of skates and have a go at something new.  There are over 200 CIB chapters worldwide, CIB Scotland being a fledgling chapter.  With events such as this at Transgression, it is the hope that word can spread about this different way of skating and the benefits that learning skills in the skate park can have on the track.

</p>
<p class="p1">Smirkcules has had an extensive Coaching career in Roller Derby, starting out with London Rockin' Rollers in 2010, before moving to Croydon Roller Derby, and <em>then</em> moving the considerable geographical distance to Newfoundland, coaching 709 Roller Derby there. After a few years coaching in Canada and Australia, he arrived back on British shores in time to coach Birmingham Blitz Dames to top of the Tier 3 table in British Champs 2015. He's also an ex-skater for Southern Discomfort!</p>
<p class="p1">As well as all of that, he's a fairly prolific announcer, and announced at the Road to Dallas event in 2014 where Team Wales last battled it out against the UK's other teams (and Team West Indies). He's co-announced with Team Wales Manager <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/03/24/team-wales-manager-dorkmistress/">Dorkmistress</a></strong>, at other events, as well as being involved along with her in the short-lived Team Sealand, placing him in good stead to collaborate in his current role as Team Wales Head Coach.</p>
<strong>You've got a whole host of coaching experience, in the UK and Canada and Australia, but not especially in Wales. Why did you apply to coach Team Wales specifically?</strong>
<p>Wales is where I took my first guest coaching session and where I've returned multiple times to coach, announce and watch matches. It's also where I played the majority of my games in mixed scrims and co-ed matches, before injury knocked me out as a player for a long time. I have a lot of friends and derby colleagues I like working with in Wales. I have a lot of love for Wales and as a roller derby coach I like working with the Welsh derby community in different ways.
In my personal statement during the application process I summed it up with the following:
"I am really excited to be applying for the position with Team Wales as I enjoy working with passionate, hard fighting athletes who give their all."</p>
<p>And that's still true today. I'm really looking forward to our tryouts on April 24<sup>th</sup> to see these passionate fighters turn up and give their all to earn a spot to represent Wales.</p>
<p><strong>Part of the Head Coach role is sitting on the selection panel for skater tryouts. What will you be looking for in Skaters trying out for Team Wales? (And what advice would you give those thinking about trying out?)</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of things we'll be looking for. We're looking to build a squad of skaters who can work and develop together. Boiling it down as simply as possible I'd say the two main things are: ability and attitude.</p>
<p>We're looking for skaters who can perform at the highest level comfortably and confidently. Who have the capacity for moments of greatness. But we're also looking for skaters who are determined and have a strong work ethic, who don't mind doing what is asked of them at any time. Skaters who know and play roller derby as a team sport.</p>
<p>These two aren't mutually exclusive. Skaters should be able to demonstrate both of these during tryouts. So if you are coming to tryout or want to sign up, I'd say put your best skills on show and work hard during your session. The expectations are high because they will one day be up against some of the best skaters in the world and we are building a squad to work together and compete at that high level. So as long as skaters understand this and give their best, they'll do fine.</p>
<p><strong>In common with Team Wales Manager Dorkmistress, you've also done a lot of announcing, including at the Road to Dallas pre-World Cup event in 2014. How did you feel announcing Road to Dallas?</strong></p>
<p>I've done a lot of things in roller derby; coach, player, bench staff, NSO. The only thing I've not done in a bout is ref. Announcing is fantastic because you act as the middle person between the game and the crowd. You have to know both of these aspects well to get a good vibe going and ensure the game isn't compromised by your announcing whilst also keeping the crowd informed. It's a challenge but a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Announcing at Road to Dallas was great! It had four great national teams playing, one of which was making their international tournament debut. I love watching Team Scotland's packwork. Team Ireland showed some great high speed derby. West Indies was a new team to watch. Team Wales included skaters I like to watch play at anytime. So was really exciting and fun day. For anyone wanting international experience in the crowd, NSO or reffing, these smaller scale events are great opportunities if they come around. The audience was fantastic for Road to Dallas for all the teams playing. Was great derby to watch and commentate on and a great crowd to work with and for.</p>
<p><strong>The other component of being Head Coach is, well, coaching Team Wales. What principles are you going to be adopting to take the Team as far as they can go in the World Cup?</strong></p>
<p>Well I don't want to give too many secrets away just yet but I have a personal coaching style and play mentality I refer to as the Complete Game. This involves not letting any moment go wasted. Every second counts and I want the team to make every second matter. Essentially I want to create a squad of ruthless, fierce warriors who are a challenge to any team they come up against, giving no quarter and expecting none in return. The image and motif I often use to describe it is a bunch of elite guerrilla warriors getting in, getting the job done and sticking the knife in.</p>
<p><strong>We don't know much about the potential location of the 2017 World Cup. Where would you like it to be, and what teams would you most like to see Wales play at it?</strong></p>
<p>My top three locations would be:</p>
<p>Wales – home crowd and Wales is a very welcoming, friendly place that people should visit. Derby just makes it better.
Finland – I love Helsinki and if at the end of the year, lots of snow and winter fun.
Australia – Outdoor tournament anyone? BBQs, beaches and huge love of sport! Lots of Summer fun if at end of year again.</p>
<p>The three teams I'd love for Wales to come up against at the next World Cup are:</p>
<p>Norway – I'd like to have another game against them as I think the game against them in 2014 was a good match up. Be good to see how both teams have progressed since then.
England – Classic England vs Wales matches in every sport are always exciting so let's make it happen in roller derby.
Finland – I like Team Finland. I think it'd be a tough game but exciting.
Dream Final:</p>
<p>Wales vs Australia – The team I coach vs the nation I was born in competing for the world cup. Couldn't ask for more than that!</p>

<strong><a href="http://www.beijingrollerderby.com/">Beijing Roller Derby</a></strong> have been working on a project in collaboration with <strong><a href="http://www.unwomen.org/">United Nations Women</a></strong> (the UN Entity responsible for Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women), and today they have announced it publicly.
<p>The "<strong>International HeForShe Roller Derby Invitational</strong>" will be a co-ed tournament, featuring skaters from <strong><a href="http://shanghairollerderby.tumblr.com/">Shanghai Roller Derby</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://bangkokrollerderby.weebly.com/">Bangkok Roller Derby</a></strong> as well as the hosts Beijing. Hosted in <strong>Ditan Olympic Park</strong>, Beijing, from <strong>7pm</strong> on the <strong>3rd of May</strong>, the event will be the first ever Roller Derby tournament of any kind in China.</p>
<p>"The event was first a dream to bring a team to Beijing so we could finally hold a bout or a scrimmage. Our teammate Sustainable Devilment saw something bigger. With the new domestic violence law in China and the HeforShe campaign, she felt derby was a great way to show a sport that encourages women empowerment" said Bejing Roller Derby's Jessica Jabbit.</p>
<p>The event is being described as a 'scrimmage' and an 'informal tournament', which we take to mean that it is not being undertaken for ranking purposes. In fact, the purpose of this event is more serious than sporting rankings; as part of the UN Women's HeForShe campaign, the aim is to show solidarity between all sexes with women across the globe, by the symbolic means of a full-contact sport where women are the dominant force.</p>
<p>Bangkok Roller Derby's Jean-Claude Von Slamme spoke to us about the event, saying:
"Our team is really excited to be a part of this event as it will be our first chance to meet with other roller derby teams and play a full game together. For some of our skaters it will be the first time they have ever played on a full sized track (ours is a little small) so the experience will be hugely beneficial to not only individual development but also in inspiring a new motivation and enthusiasm in our team by giving them a real taste of Roller Derby as a professional sport and as a worldwide community. We're extremely grateful to Beijing Roller Derby and UN Women for giving us this opportunity and working so hard to get us all there. They have been so supportive and I hope we can show our appreciation when we arrive by making this a really memorable event for everyone involved."</p>
<p>There's a draw from a high level Roller Derby perspective here, too: <strong><a href="http://www.gothamgirlsrollerderby.com/">Gotham Girls Roller Derby</a></strong>'s <em>Sexy Slaydie</em> and <em>Miss Tea Maven</em>, and <strong><a href="http://www.nyshockexchange.com/">New York Shock Exchange</a></strong>'s <em>Willverine,</em> will be attending, providing a training bootcamp ahead of the tournament event itself! From Beijing Roller Derby's perspective, this is also a great opportunity to further increase the visibility of Roller Derby in China, an aim which they have been pursuing with some success over the past 3 years. (The topic of the promotion of Roller Derby in such contexts is something which is also close to this Blog's interests, and we will be following up on this with an article later in the year.)</p>
<p>Gotham's Miss Tea Maven was keen to emphasise the wider importance of the event's context. "Gender Equality is incredibly important for me.  As a self identified cis-gendered straight female, every single person should be able to self identify how they would like to.  I feel like parts of the world are taking great strides in moving forward with movements like 'HeForShe'  but there is still a lot of work to be done.  The recent North Carolina transgender bill is a very saddening example of this.  We as human beings need to support our fellow human beings, and make sure that rights are equal for everyone no matter how you identify or what your birth certificate says.  It shouldn't matter - you are a human.</p>
<p>I am beyond excited to help support this cause through my favorite medium - roller derby - and being able to go to China is just an amazing experience... I can't wait for the event to start!"</p>

<p>Earlier, we covered <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamwalesrollerderby/">Team Wales</a></strong>' <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/03/24/team-wales-manager-dorkmistress/">Manager</a></strong> and one of their <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/03/28/team-wales-skater-buccaneer-betty-fear/">skaters</a></strong> from the 2014 team, but we shouldn't forget the Coaching team, who will be training and organising Team Wales on track into the 2017 World Cup. In collaboration with <a href="http://ukrda.org.uk">UKRDA</a>, we're happy to start off our run of Coaching team interviews with Team Wales' returning Line-Up Manager, Professor Moriarty.</p>

(Photo: Jason Ruffell, <a href="http://www.roller-derby-on-film.co.uk/">Roller-derby-on-film</a>.)</p>
<p>Professor Moriarty has been a member of <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/NPTRD">Neath Port Talbot Roller Derby</a></strong> since she started in the game, 3 years ago. She bench coached the team through last year's British Champs, and into this year's. Selected as Line-Up Manager for the first Team Wales which competed in the 2014 Roller Derby World Cup in Dallas, she reapplied for the role, and was successful in this earlier this year.</p>
<p><strong>In common with other members of Team Wales, you're returning in your role as LUM from last time around. What lead to you reapply to the role for a second run?</strong></p>
<p>Yep, I’m a glutton for punishment! I had an amazing time during my first term with Team Wales but it was quite an emotional rollercoaster due to us being a brand new team.  We had to start everything from scratch; some said that we would never make it to Dallas, but we proved the doubters wrong and were placed 17th in our very first World Cup. I feel like Team Wales is our baby and I want to be able to nurture it and watch it grow from the fledgling team we were last time. I want to be able to say; "I was part of that. I helped that grow to new heights within the Derby community."</p>
<p><strong>The LUM is also involved in selection and training for the National Teams. What things were you looking out for in Team Wales selection last time (and what are you looking out for in the new applicants this time)?</strong></p>
<p>During our first try outs we were trying to find as many skaters that were able and prepared to give the commitment to a new team that was needed. I remember seeing Jen (R27) for the first time and she blew my mind with her passion and love of the sport.
With our ability to now prove we are a country that wants to be present on the World Stage of Derby, I think our thoughts are different. We want to build on what we did last time and need to be more specific in the direction we take. We’ve done the “Got there, did that”, we now want to inspire local skaters to want to be part of their countries team. This can only be done by ensuring that we look for not only existing talent, but also rough diamonds.
I may offend a few skaters but my ideology is: we are Welsh, we are not pretty players but what we do, we do well, with the grit and determination of a country that is hardworking and focused on being the best they can possibly be!</p>
<p><strong>And how are you planning on contributing to the training process for the selection?</strong></p>
<p>I am not a coach and will never claim to be one; what I bring to the table is the ability to read people and be able to know what they are capable of. During the last term we had a skater that was not the best, but her communication was second to none. I fought against a lot of opposition to ensure that she was given the chances she deserved and it paid off. Just because you don’t have the right footwork or the right build shouldn’t mean that you’re not suitable to play for your country. This sport was built on inclusivity and I am a huge believer in the underdog!</p>
<p><strong>LUM can get fairly pressured, especially when playing against a tough team (like New Zealand), on a national stage. How you do manage the job in that kind of situation (and what's it like)?</strong></p>
<p>I am a very level headed person (my Husband may disagree with that). When others are losing their heads around me, I am looking ahead to see where we can make changes to improve what we are doing, so as to alleviate the problem. I like to know each and every one of my skaters, their abilities and what I think they are capable of. With this in mind, I am able to read situations and correct them without causing any pressure on my skaters. I believe in forward thinking, analysing what could and may go wrong and having strategies in place to combat them even before they arise, so as to make sure my skaters are in their Zen place when playing.</p>
<p><strong>Returning to the role means that you bring a lot of experience with you. What you do think the last World Cup taught you about LUMing the National Team (and is there anything you'll be doing differently this time?)</strong></p>
<p>The last World Cup taught me to be prepared for all eventualities: Know who does what and where, so when something does crop up it can be dealt with immediately. It taught me to appreciate help and to work as a team. To quote Fear's mantra, “Team work, makes the dream work”. The only thing I’d do differently this time is to try and soak more of the atmosphere in, as while it's happening it’s like a whirlwind all around you and then, poof it’s over!</p>
<p><strong>(And what has been the best part of LUMing Team Wales so far…)</strong></p>
<p>The best part for me was during the World Cup each country had its own room, which was situated on the floor below the auditorium. Before each game we would congregate here and walk up as a team singing. We sang everything from the National Anthem to Tom Jones, it was amazing!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>Last time around, you were reluctant to say who you'd like to see Team Wales take on in the World Cup. But, we're going to try again! If you could have any team (existing or not) play Team Wales, who would it be? (And if the World Cup could be anywhere, where would you want it to be?)</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to see the World Cup in Europe this time. It’s a very expensive time and I think the European countries need a chance to be able to show what we can do. I'm still reluctant [to pick opponents] but would love to see a proper  6 Nations competition, just like the rugby!!</p>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Despite the strong growth of Roller Derby internationally, the couple of years head start that the USA had during the revival means that the strongest Roller Derby is still found in that country. As a result, increasingly more European teams are making the step of attending the big American WFTDA Sanctioned tournaments, hoping to both further their WFTDA Rankings (which, being influenced by Strength of Schedule, are much harder to develop without a large number of Sanctioned games against high level opponents) and their own skill.</span>
<p><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/01/europe-goes-to-beach-brawl/screen-shot-2016-03-30-at-13-10-27/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-6892"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6892" src="2016/03/screen-shot-2016-03-30-at-13-10-27.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-03-30 at 13.10.27" width="700" height="528"></a></p>
<p>The most popular destination for visiting teams this year seems to be the <a href="http://www.beachbrawlrollerderby.com/home"><strong>Beach Brawl</strong></a>, <strong>May 13-15</strong>, hosted by Gold Coast Roller Grrls in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  (We are covering Auld Reekie Roller Girls' own plans for USA travel in a separate article, coming soon!)</p>
<p>Current top-of-the-British-Champs leaderboard, <strong>Newcastle Roller Girls</strong> have set their sights on the tournament as the next step in their development as a league. This will be their first ever US roller derby tournament, although not their first ever WFTDA tournament; in common with many Beach Brawl attendees this year, Newcastle attended the 2015 Skate Odyssey, hosted by Gent Go-Go Rollergirls, coming second overall.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Newcastle's Co-Captain, Missy Pow-Pow, told us: "Since July 2014 when we graduated as a full WFTDA league, our aim has been to improve our ranking. We’ve been working hard on and off track, both physically and mentally, to up our game.  </span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Last year our hard work started to pay off when we won the British Champs national Tier 2 division and were promoted to the premier tier. We also only missed out on 1st place by 2 points at our first ever WFTDA tournament - A Skate Odyssey. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Our game has improved so much so quickly that our WFTDA ranking doesn't reflect the real strength of our team and we’re struggling to find the sanctioned games that we need in Europe to be able to improve our ranking. So we’re having to do what other leagues in a similar position to us are doing - going stateside to play roller derby. It wasn't an easy decision to make - the cost to the league, skaters and support staff in both monetary terms as well as time is huge, but we felt there was no other option if we were serious about improving our WFDTA ranking.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">We applied for several US WFTDA events with Beach Brawl being our top choice so we were stoked when we got the invite and can't believe it’s now only six weeks left until we fly out! We are continuing to work hard, improving our fitness and performance so that we are ready and prepared as best we can be for this.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">On behalf of all of us at NRG, I want to thank everyone who’s supported our Beach Brawl fundraising campaign so far - we couldn’t do it without you and we hope we’ll do the North East and the UK proud."</span></p>
<p>Also attending for the first time are <strong>Dublin Roller Derby</strong>, who are facing Auld Reekie this weekend. Dublin were also attendees at the 2015 SKOD, where they only narrowly missed out getting to the semi-final, after a 2 point loss against the hosts (just as Newcastle did in the final)! As the highest ranked team in Ireland, it's especially the case that DRD have to travel overseas to compete against better teams.</p>
<p>Dublin's Co-Captain, Snowy, said: "<span style="font-weight:400;">Dublin Roller Derby are about to achieve the ultimate derby dream by becoming the first Irish league to compete in an International Tournament in the United States. This May, we’re off to Beach Brawl, Florida, for our first taste of US roller derby.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">We’re unbelievably excited to play in the country that invented this wonderful, mad sport of ours and to see what challenges we’ll face stateside. We might also be a little excited by the prospect of a week in a sunnier clime than Dublin, but needless to say we’ll be packing factor 50 sunscreen."</span></p>
<p>Newcastle Roller Girls and Dublin Roller Derby are both raising money for the travel to the tournament via GoFundMe.
Newcastle's GoFundMe is here <strong><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/nrgtobeachbrawl">https://www.gofundme.com/nrgtobeachbrawl</a></strong> with a series of rewards for donators including new limited edition Beach Brawl themed merch. They also have several other fundraising initiatives in hand, including a <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/540135629522203/">Pub Quiz</a></strong> on the 10th of April (with some big prizes, including show tickets and first class train travel!).</p>
<p>Dublin's GoFundMe is here <strong><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/dublinrollerderby">https://www.gofundme.com/dublinrollerderby</a></strong> , where they also have a range of limited edition (Miami-Vice themed) merch as donator rewards. In common with Newcastle, Dublin are also running a <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1007331919339066/">Table Quiz</a></strong>, with a Father Ted theme (!) on the 26th of April.</p>
<p>The schedule for Beach Brawl is not public quite yet. When it is,  our localised and translated <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/03/29/beach-brawl-viewing-guide-timezone-adjusted/"><strong>viewing guide will be here</strong></a>. It will link to FlatTrackStats for each match up, and will have livestream links as soon as we are aware of them.</p>

<p>Beach Brawl is Gold Coast Derby Grrls' annual Roller Derby invitational. This year, it features many teams from the UK and Europe, including Newcastle Roller Girls, Dublin Roller Derby, Paris Rollergirls, Rainy City Roller Derby and Central City Roller Girls.
This viewing guide contains time-zone adjusted links for the bouts, highlights for each country, and links to the livestream. For completed bouts, we link to the archive video footage (where available - currently Track D's video seems to be a bit broken, for Days 2 and 3 only: we're leaving links to that until the full footage is uploaded [a stand in link just links to the start of the video there is]), and FlatTrackStats stats when available.</p>

Beach Brawl is Gold Coast Derby Grrls' annual Roller Derby invitational. This year, it features many teams from the UK and Europe, including Newcastle Roller Girls, Dublin Roller Derby, Paris Rollergirls, Rainy City Roller Derby and Central City Roller Girls.
This viewing guide contains time-zone adjusted links for the bouts, highlights for each country, and links to the livestream. For completed bouts, we link to the archive video footage (where available - currently Track D's video seems to be a bit broken, for Days 2 and 3 only: we're leaving links to that until the full footage is uploaded [a stand in link just links to the start of the video there is]), and FlatTrackStats stats when available.

<!--nextpage--><p>Beach Brawl is Gold Coast Derby Grrls' annual Roller Derby invitational. This year, it features many teams from the UK and Europe, including Newcastle Roller Girls, Dublin Roller Derby, Paris Rollergirls, Rainy City Roller Derby and Central City Roller Girls.
This viewing guide contains time-zone adjusted links for the bouts, highlights for each country, and links to the livestream. For completed bouts, we link to the archive video footage (where available - currently Track D's video seems to be a bit broken, for Days 2 and 3 only: we're leaving links to that until the full footage is uploaded [a stand in link just links to the start of the video there is]), and FlatTrackStats stats when available.</p>
