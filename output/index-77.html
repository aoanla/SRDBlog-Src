<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is traditional, we’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"><span class="s2"><b>Flat Track Stats</b></span></a> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <strong><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). Our new SRD Rank for July will be out after this weekend – the fifth for this year, with this years’ redesigned interface, allowing you to browse historical rankings for the last 10 years, view a map of all the active teams, select by any combinations of country, gender, and get predictions of scores. (It also has some WFTDA rankings, including the 31 May ranking, as well as SRDRank.)</span></p>

            </div>
        <div>
<p></p>
<p>Since its inaugural run in 2015, the UK's "National Tournament", British Champs, has run on a complex hierarchical tiers and divisions system - with 4 (or 5 in 2016) ability-binned tiers, each subdivided into a variable number of geographically-binned subdivisions (depending on the number of teams in the tier, the number of geographical "divisions" is selected to give 5 to 6 teams per division).</p>
<p>If a team ends the year at the top (or bottom) of its tier, it is promoted (or relegated) to an adjacent tier - but the destination <em>division</em> must also be selected, which causes complications.</p>
<p>Running a geographically split tournament division structure is, arguably, making a rod for one's own back. Quite apart from the geopolitics of "north" and "south" in the British psyche, the additional splitting constraint makes it almost impossible to balance relegation and promotion whilst keeping the bounds of the regions sensible.</p>
<p>This is increasingly hard for the UK's British Championships, as the tournament is, in fact, <em>shrinking</em> year-on-year. In 2015, there were 72 competing women's teams; in 2016, 66, and this year there are just <em>61</em>.
British Champs themselves <em>claim</em> to be growing, but this is purely because they had no men's tier in 2015 - adding the 20 men's teams in 2016 makes the tournament "bigger", but only in a <em>technical</em> sense, as there's no cross-over between the men's and women's British Champs tiers. (The Men's British Champs has not changed in size between 2016 and 2017, so overall, Champs has still declined overall in the last year.)</p>
<p>We've plotted the shapes of the various British Champs Tiers + Divisions over the years to illustrate how they've changed shape - both from teams leaving and (less so) joining the tournament; and from promotion and relegation. (The Tier 5 is not animated, as it only existed for 2016.) On these plots, the dotted straight lines mark the North-South and East-West centrelines of the UK, so you can judge how well Champs manages to represent the geography of the UK in its divisions each year.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21048" src="2017/06/bct1.gif" alt="bct1" width="618" height="683"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21049" src="2017/06/bct2.gif" alt="bct2" width="583" height="681"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21050" src="2017/06/bct3.gif" alt="bct3" width="629" height="692"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21051" src="2017/06/bct4.gif" alt="bct4" width="567" height="700"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21052" src="2017/06/bct5.png" alt="bct5" width="580" height="697"></p>
<p>As can be seen, there are some very odd phenomena caused by the strict tier-and-geographical-division format. We can also see where excessive travel - remember, at least one pair of teams in a given fixture is hosted at another venue in their tier+division - can be a wear on opponents.
One interesting phenomenon is the general migration of several of the South divisions towards the south-west, as promotion and relegation (which is uneven in Champs) requires more central teams to be added to the East divisions.
</p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
One should, of course, prefer to critique than criticise. In this spirit, we have some suggestions (drawn from work ongoing for the Roller Derby World Cup 2018) as to how British Champs could improve its efficiency, whilst still providing the core benefit of giving a guaranteed, structured, 4 or 5 games to each participating team. Our suggestions also allow matching teams to close-by opponents, of similar strength; and provided a UK-wide "ranking" and "rating" of the participants.
<p><strong>Firstly</strong>: throw away the strict categories - not just the divisions, but also the tiers. Strict boundaries are the enemy of efficient matching - the teams at the bottom of Tier X should be able to play the top of Tier X+1, and the eastmost teams in West division should be able to play the westmost teams in East division.
Teams in any tier should be able to host games for any other tier. [The German Bundesliga allows this already, for example.]</p>
<p><strong>Secondly</strong>: match each team to 5 opponents, on the basis of their proximity and strength relative to the team in question. There are well-understood algorithms for doing this: the minimum-weight, maximum-width matching algorithm has been used for much larger problems than this for decades (and is used by RDWC2018 for scheduling).
[We actually have one additional constraint here: we want the network of teams connected by bouts to span the entire set of competitors. This is easily ensured by using an alternate matching approach for one or two of the picks for each team.]</p>
<p><strong>Thirdly</strong>: scheduling of bouts should be arranged so that every team hosts 1 double or triple header. Importantly, none of the games they host should involve them competing - this avoids home team advantage - but instead should be drawn from matches where both teams are closeby. [Because we have no Tiers, there's an ample supply of such matches here.] We assign bouts to hosts by total travel distance, using maximum-weight matching again.</p>
<p><strong>Fourthly</strong>: thanks to the constraints in matching above, we can produce a ranking for the teams via any reasonable rating algorithm - Flat Track Stats' Elo-derived rating, either of the SRDRank mechanisms, or others - on the basis of all of the games played over the season. The published yearly rating can be used to establish "Champions", and also to inform the matches for next year.
</p>
<h3>Example - 2017</h3>
As an example, we present how the 2017 British Champs would have looked, if run as we propose. In this case, matches have been made using SRDRank ratings from February 2017, if they existed - there are 3 teams which are problematic here (<span class="s1">Durham City Rolling Angels, </span><span class="s1">Riverside Rebels Roller Derby, </span><span class="s1">Arcadia Roller Derby</span><span class="s1">) for which we assigned an "average" ranking as a placeholder. We stand by the <em>bouts</em> themselves as the best matches possible.</span>
<p>The resulting assignments of bouts to hosts would be the following fixtures (these don't take into account the size of the hosting venue, which obviously may be significant for some fixtures - a more polished version that was written in less than a day would include other considerations, but the bouts themselves would be the same):

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is traditional, we’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"><span class="s2"><b>Flat Track Stats</b></span></a> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <strong><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). Our new SRD Rank for June is out – the fourth for this year, with this years’ redesigned interface, allowing you to browse historical rankings for the last 10 years, view a map of all the active teams, select by country, gender, and get predictions of scores. (It also has some WFTDA rankings, including the 31 May ranking, as well as SRDRank.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]</span></p>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20568" src="2017/06/bootcamp-banner-blog.png" alt="Skate Tay Victory!" width="727" height="315"><p>Dundee Roller Girls are hosting their first ever bootcamp on the <strong>first of July</strong> in <strong>Manhattan Works, Dundee! </strong>Open to all, this bootcamp is welcoming pre mins skaters as well as recently passed individuals looking to cement their derby skillz! This event boasts four hours (<strong>11am - 3pm) </strong>of minimal contact training, with on skates tickets selling out on day 1 - <em><strong>spectator tickets are left for a mere £10 a head!</strong></em></p>
<p>Breaking the day down into sections: the five DRG coaches are Goldginger #77, G-Wrecks #713, Hubs #88, Landsborough #792 and Liston #07! Attendees can look forward to the following lessons:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♥ Wall work with Hubs and G-Wrecks! ♥</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-20812" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/06/walls.png?w=300" alt="walls" width="446" height="336"><em>"We can't wait to get started on our block for the bootcamp! Sharing skating skills with newer skaters and encouraging everyone, no matter their skating levels, to engage with the core skills needed to further roller derby in Scotland is something we both really want to be a part of! It's really the best way to start the summer!!"</em>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♥ Jammer work with Landborough and Goldginger ♥</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-20811" src="2017/06/jammers.png" alt="jammers" width="437" height="336"><em>"Our league has really benefited from specific jammer drills and discussions on how to approach the Star. Being able to share our experiences not only on a skills level but also a coaching level is a really exciting prospect! We'll work you hard but it'll be worth it!"</em>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">♥ Footwork with Liston ♥</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-16584" src="2017/03/laura-liston.png" alt="Laura Liston" width="271" height="355"><em>"The building blocks for good wall work always starts with footwork! Lateral movement, recaptures and even jammer work relies on skaters having a strong base of footwork! I'm hoping to break down some of the more daunting skills for skaters to work on before bringing them into the wall! If you're stronger as one, you're stronger together."</em></p>
<p>Due to on skates tickets selling out on the first day, the DRG have added extra off skates spectator tickets to allow more to attend! Spectators will be welcomed in discussions of skills and drills throughout the day, to ask questions to any of the coaches as well as take notes, pictures and videos. As this bootcamp is aimed at post/pre mins, the coaches are hoping that skaters will take their newly polished skills back to their leagues to extend the learning process around Scotland (and further afield!).</p>

<p>Recently, Papa Whisky published an <a href="https://medium.com/@papawhiskey/how-do-rankings-work-1d0a1c5bc5d3"><strong>article on how the WFTDA Ranking system works</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This was a good introduction to the system, but perhaps missed a few technical points, which we feel are important. In addition, we think it might be useful to introduce other rating systems used in Roller Derby for comparison.</p>
<p>This article aims to address these two issues, and should be read in concert with the above linked article.</p>
<p>In this article, there is some maths. In this maths, we use: <strong>Pu</strong> to mean "the points scored by your team", <strong>Po</strong> to mean "the points scored by the opponent", as well as some other values later on.
</p>
<h3>Other Ranking systems - <a href="http://www.flattrackstats.com">FTS</a>
</h3>
While Papa Whisky implies that Flat Track Stats does ranking and rating in a similar way to WFTDA's own official ratings and rankings, in fact the FTS algorithm is somewhat different.
<p>FTS ratings are a variant of <em>Elo ratings</em> - named for Arpad Elo, who developed them for Chess in the late 1950s. Rather like WFTDA Ratings, FTS Ratings are an indication of how well you should do, but with a different basis - Elo Ratings are logarithmic, like Richter factors for earthquakes, or decibels for sound, so every 400 (or so) difference in Elo Rating is a ten-<em>fold</em> (or so) factor in expected score <em>ratio</em>. [FTS probably doesn't use the number 400 exactly.]</p>
<p>FTS ratings also update based upon how well you do, versus your expected performance. FTS measures performance in terms of what they call "difference over sum" (DoS) - this is the ratio of the point spread (your points minus their points) to the total points (your points plus their points) in the game:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Pu-Po) / (Pu+Po)</p>
 Essentially, every game you play adds points to your rating, based upon how well you beat the expectation from your relative ratings. (The actual calculation used by FTS is not published, but classical Elo ratings give you a bonus based on the sum of your opponent's rating and a factor proportional to the fraction of the score you got.)
<p>At any given time, a team's FTS Rating is the sum of all of the bonus points they have gotten over the team's entire history. [In fact, most teams will have more than one FTS Rating - FTS maintains multiple ratings; for WFTDA, MRDA, Europe, North America etc - which differ mostly in which games count towards a teams' total points.]
</p>
<h3>Other Ranking systems - MRDA</h3>
The MRDA also does not use WFTDA ratings or rankings for their quarterly ratings. In fact, non-members have no knowledge of how the MRDA Rankings are calculated.
<p>This also means we can't say much more about it here, which is extremely problematic.
</p>
<h3>Other Ranking systems - <a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRDRank (v1,2)</a>
</h3>
Our own rating system, SRDRank, is the most different in principles to the rating systems here.
<p>Every other rating system works on pairwise comparison - a given game affects only the ratings of the two teams which play, and the rating of Team A will be the sum of all the effects from the games in its history.</p>
<p>SRDRank is based on global optimisation: every game doesn't just tell us something about the two teams which played, but also something about every other team which has played them recently, and so on.</p>
<p>SRDRank v1 and v2 perform this calculation in slightly different ways, but in both cases they care about the points ratio:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Pu/Po</p>
in any given game. (Technically, we use log(Pu/Po), but that doesn't affect understanding.)
<p>SRDRank v1 models each game as a "spring" between the two teams (which has a natural length proportional to the result of the game) - we run a simulation of the system with all the springs in place, and see where it ends up putting all the teams. The relative positions of the teams as the result of the springs tensioning against each other give their "ratings", and "Rankings".</p>
<p>SRDRank v2 uses least-squares linear regression to do the same thing. This is a technique to find the values for a set of unknowns (in this case, the team strengths) which "best fit" the observations (in this case, the ratio of scores in the games played) by minimising the distance between the results in reality, and the results predicted by the rankings.</p>
<p>Both SRDRank v1 and v2 adjust the importance of games so that older games are less significant than newer ones (by making the springs "weaker", or by allowing more distance with less penalty) - the amount we do so has been optimised itself by analysis of the history of the sport.</p>
<p>SRDRank v2 also attempts to detect teams which have changed suddenly in strength (because, say, their roster completely changed at the start of the season), by performing statistical tests on the predictions it makes. Teams which do change suddenly are "split" into a new and an old team, at the point of the change - which means both that the new roster can be given a different rating to the old one; and also that the history of the team doesn't contaminate our predictions for teams which play them in future.</p>
<p>SRDRank v1 and v2 are included in our github repo for prediction code, <a href="https://github.com/aoanla/ranking-chain-inference"><strong>here</strong></a>.
</p>
<h3>Pros and Cons of Rating Systems - WFTDA</h3>
In his article, Papa Whisky notes that one of the weaknesses of the WFTDA rating system is that it is currently slightly opaque - the magic "median" value isn't what you'd expect it to be from the published results, because the WFTDA median is calculated from a longer list which is not published.
<p>However, that isn't the real problem with WFTDA ratings - although it is related. To explain their issues, we'll need to do a little bit of simple mathematics.</p>
<p>As you know from the article, WFTDA ratings award you points for any sanctioned games based on the result of the calculation:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">300 * Pu * So / (Pu+Po)</p>
where So is the Strength Factor of the opponent. Given that a Strength Factor is just the WFTDA Ranking Points divided by the median Ranking Points, we can write this as
<p style="text-align:center;">300 * Pu * Ro / ( Pu+Po) * Rm</p>
where Ro is the opponent's ranking points, and Rm is the median of them.
<p>In order to "keep the same rating", a team needs to score equal to its current WFTDA Ranking Points. So, we can write the condition for retaining Rating as:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">300 * Pu * Ro / ( Pu+Po) * Rm = Ru</p>
This relationship is the source of all of the issues with the WFTDA Rating system.
<p>Firstly, let's rearrange this to give the fraction of points the team needs to score to maintain rating, in terms of everything else:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Pu/(Pu+Po) = (Ru/Ro) * (Rm/300)</p>
So, the first thing we notice is that the "fraction of points" you need is proportional to the <em>ratio</em> of the two teams' WFTDA Ranking Points. This is the source of those "weird results" which Papa Whisky notes for bouts between teams of very different strengths.  In particular, it can mean that there's simply not enough available points for a team to retain its ranking, even if it got 100% of the points.
<p>To see that that's true, let's imagine that our team gets 100% of the points, so Pu/(Pu+Po) is 1. That implies that
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Ru/Ro) = (300/Rm)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">or</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Ru = (300/Rm)*Ro</p>
300/Rm is a bit more than 2 (we'll come back to this later), so our team needs a 100% blowout to break-even against a team with about<em> twice</em> its Rating. In the example Papa Whisky uses, Gotham had a SF (and thus rating) more than twice that of Windy: there was no possible way for Gotham to benefit from that game, as they would need to score <em>more than 100%</em> of the points!
<p>The other problem is that teams need to continually beat expectations in order to retain ranking. To see that this is the case, let's assume that the two teams have identical WFTDA Ranking Points, Rx. In that case, the formula gives:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Pu/(Pu+Po) = (Rx/Rx) * (Rm/300) = Rm/300</p>
where the final step is straightforward.
If a team plays a team with exactly the same strength as it, we would expect the points to be divided equally, so Pu/(Pu+Po) should be 0.5 ... which implies
<p style="text-align:center;">0.5 = Rm/300  ⇒ Rm = 150</p>
Of course, Rm does not equal 150 - it's set to the median WFTDA Ranking Points, which is currently around 141.
<p>The result of this is that teams need to <em>beat</em> their own expectation by about 7% in every game, <em>just to stay where they are</em>. In a case where two well matched teams perform as expected... not only does the losing team lose ranking, but so does the <em>winning</em> team. (This does balance out a little, in that it affects all teams, so there's a general "deflation" in scores one month to the next... but it is still counterintuitive.)</p>
<p>The Pro of the WFTDA rating system is that it's very easy to understand, and you can calculate expected scores and so on with just a piece of paper and some mental arithmetic (as long as you know the median Ranking Points). However, with computers ubiquitous nowadays, it is not clear how much of an advantage this is - <a href="https://derbyontoast.com/head-to-head"><strong>DerbyOnToast</strong></a> (and our own SRDRank visualiser) can both automate ratings calculations for you, so you don't need to be able to do them yourself.
</p>
<h3>Pros and Cons of Rating Systems - FTS</h3>
The FTS Rating system has all the problems that Elo systems have in general.
<p>In particular, Elo ratings consider that all results are relevant, even years after they happened. Rating changes only happen as a result of new games being played - so if you don't play any games for a year or two, you'll just keep the same FTS rating regardless.</p>
<p>This has the counter-intuitive result that it's sometimes better to just not play games, rather than lose rating. (If Gotham had decided not to play any games at Champs or later, they'd still be top of the leaderboard... more strikingly, the Oly Rollers retained a significant FTS rating for several years, despite not entering any scores at all.)</p>
<p>Related to this, FTS ratings take time to adjust to sudden changes - if a team suddenly becomes much weaker or strong (due to, say, a complete change of roster), it takes quite a lot of games for FTS to catch up, as there's only so much change FTS can accommodate in a single bout. Additionally, while this adjustment is taking place, all of the opponents have unfair rating changes - FTS changes are symmetric, so for team A to gain rating, team B must lose rating, even if the cause is entirely due to a change in team A.</p>
<p>FTS's advantage is that, like WFTDA Ratings, FTS ratings are quick and easy to calculate. So quick, in fact, that FTS recalculates all of its ratings at least once an hour, to guarantee that predictions are as up to date as possible.</p>
<p>FTS also does not suffer from either of the problems of WFTDA Rankings - there is no combination of teams for which either team "can't win".
</p>
<h3>Pros and Cons of Rating Systems - SRDRank</h3>
SRDRank, being a different class of rating system to the other two, has entirely different issues.
<p>SRDRank's main issue is its relative complexity. Whilst least-squares regression, and statistical tests, are no more advanced than first year undergraduate level, this is still a significant increase in complexity over the other two.</p>
<p>SRDRank's other issue stems from the global nature of its calculation. As with FTS, an undetected sudden change in team strength can cause unwanted effects in the ratings of other teams. As SRDRank is a globally optimised rating, this effect can make (small) changes in rating even for teams which never play the team in question. We attempt to minimise this effect via the statistical test and splitting step, but there will always been a short period where there's not enough evidence to detect a sudden change, and where ratings will be somewhat affected.</p>
<p>Finally, SRDRank is limited by the depth and quality of information available to it. Because it uses FTS's own records as a data source, it can only use information that FTS consider relevant. Because of this, there a several uncontrolled sources of error which reduce SRDRank's accuracy - we don't always know if there's a "home" team, as FTS doesn't track the host of a bout, and assumes that one team must be a "home" team regardless - and for tournaments, FTS is poor at assigning hosts for tournament type events which run over many fixtures; we don't know the length of a bout (which affects the reliability of a rating); we don't know rosters for most games (because most bouts don't upload statsbooks), so we can't model expectations based on players who are missing or present - and so on.
We also, of course, as with all rating systems, can't rate teams for whom there is no information at all. If your team doesn't upload stats or scores to FTS, then FTS and SRDRank can't rate you. Historically, this has affected Mexico and Latin America as whole more than most other reasons, which is extremely problematic, as it also decreases visibility of the fantastic amount of derby happening in those areas.</p>
<p>In comparison, SRDRank can rank and rate the entire world's roller derby teams, not just subsets of them. It also allows detection of cliques within the community - groups of teams which play each other more than others, and thus are better rated relative to other members of the group than the outside world - and selection of ratings based on geographical location.
</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
Knowing a bit about possibilities for rating systems is important in judging how to use them (and which ones are good at which things).
<p>If you're interested in gaming your WFTDA rating, it's best to avoid playing teams with less than 70% of your rating (to avoid matchings where you simply can't score enough to improve your rating, regardless of what you do); and preferably play teams closer in rank to you, but who you think you can beat by more than 10% of the score...</p>

<p>Returning to our series on the 11 teams new to the Roller Derby World Cup 2018 in Manchester, and we're staying in Europe for this one.</p>
<p>Poland, despite having one of the largest populations in Central Europe, has only recently developed a significant Roller Derby population. We talked to one of Team Poland's organisers, Ewa Kaczyńska, about the formation of the National Team.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19856" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/06/screen-shot-2017-06-02-at-15-34-22.png?w=300" alt="Screen Shot 2017-06-02 at 15.34.22" width="300" height="188"> The Polish Flag (standing in for Team Poland's logo)</p>
<p>With Roller Derby having only come to Poland in 2013 - the first league in Poznań quickly followed by Warsaw, then Wrocław, Szczecin and Gdańsk - there was little possibility to compete in the 2014 World Cup. Since then, Polish Derby has grown considerably, to the point of holding their first <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1232048456872900/">Derby Sevens tournament</a></strong> this year, as well as hosting one of Scald Eagle &amp; Lady Trample's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1852698681626181/"><strong>WinTourOpe bootcamp</strong></a> dates. Whilst not all the leagues are huge at the moment (there's a preference for mixed team events and scrims to cover the numbers for the smaller teams), Polish derby is still growing and in a strong position in the Central European vanguard.</p>
<p>As is often the case, inline skating is more popular in Poland than Quads, although, Ewa notes: "[interest in quad skates] is growing, here is a better access to quads in shops. However, not that much luck with roller derby related skate shops, as there are just 3 or 4 with limited offerings." It's perhaps the growth of Chicks in Bowls, which also has a Polish branch, which is helping to drive this interest, helping out Roller derby with the cross-over, as it does elsewhere. "Yes, they definitely [help]. It's good that girls are taking over the skateparks!"</p>
<p>For more derby related help, the community surrounding has been supportive, with bootcamps and shared bouts popular.</p>
<p>"Thanks to skaters from all over the World we are able to organize bootcamps led by experienced coaches," Ewa told us. "That is so much different from learning from the book - as we did at first! 'Roller Derby 101: The Fresh Meat Training Manual ' was our first derby bible... Now, we get a lot of help and support from Czech and German teams - I guess it's just the thing with neighbours! <span style="font-weight:400;">We also get  lots of help from Polish (and other) skaters from all over the World.</span>"</p>
<p>As the intent to participate applications opened for the 2018 World Cup,  Poland were actually the last team to sign up, as Ewa notes: "There’s been a discussion about founding Polish National Roller Derby Team going on since November 2016 in Poland. [...]No decisions were made until the very last moment before the registration period ended. We formed a Founding Committee and acted!
I think [the decision] was just about not letting people miss the opportunity to represent Poland."</p>
<p>Ewa also had personal reasons for pushing for the decision to commit, "I believe that sometimes people need to be pushed a bit. Sometimes no decisions are made simply because of the lack of courage, or ability to take responsibility for one's actions. I started derby three years ago and I started it to compete later on.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">At first I thought that Polish skaters are not yet ready to compete on such level as World Cup. Since last November, we had numerous discussions with more experienced skaters. We got a lot of encouragement and support and then it suddenly became clear to us: t</span>hings like forming a National Team need to be done to push things further, to make teams grow, to create opportunities for development. We cannot just sit doing nothing!"</p>
<p>Despite the last-minute decision, Poland's size and population have immediately produced results, with more than 50 skaters registered to try out or otherwise be involved, with around 50% from the existing Polish teams, and the rest from across the World. Poland has many nationals, and descendants of nationals, spread across the world - in Europe and in the USA - and many of them feel just as much pride for their country as those who live there.</p>
<p>"After we decided to found Team Poland we got a massive response from other parts of the World, which is just amazing; [...] it is truly touching when we get messages from people that 'want to do it for their Grandpa', although we would [also] love Team Poland to have lots of Polish girls living in Poland!"</p>
<p>As for all National Teams, and especially the newer ones, Team Poland are driven by more than simply patriotism. With National teams comes the chance of better visibility for Roller Derby as well - and a chance to combat myths and prejudice. "What really pushed us to form TP is a bigger picture," explains Ewa. "We know that all the teams went the same way at the beginning: rented vintage skates, no proper protection, no coaches, no places to skate. Also most of people think about roller derby as of 'rugby on quads' or an aggressive sport for punk girls with piercings and tattoos.</p>
<p>Surely, we do have them, but taking a part in such a big event could be an eye opener for people here! We would love them to acknowledge this sport as an athletic discipline, not only for 'outcasts'..."</p>
<p>And part of growing that athletic image is, of course, better training. As we discussed with <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/04/26/team-austria-new-to-the-world-cup/"><strong>Team Austria</strong></a>, the advantage of  National Teams is also in the sharing of experience and skills, and Ewa agrees. "We all think that apart from World Cup, the following months will let us all benefit from the joined training sessions.</p>
<p>It is a big step for Polish roller derby, that's for sure!"</p>

<p>If Spring is the time when new growth happens, how appropriate it is that East Asian Roller Derby is just now bursting into life and catalysed by the Pan-Asian Spring Rollers!</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-14040 aligncenter" src="2017/01/pan-asian.jpg" alt="pan-asian" width="223" height="200"></p>
<p>Readers may remember our coverage of Japan's second-ever Roller Derby Tournament, the<a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/01/19/the-tomodachi-derby-tournament-the-teams/"><strong> Tomodachi Derby Tournament</strong></a>, in Okinawa earlier this year. The <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/02/08/the-tomodachi-cup-teams-pan-asian-spring-rollers/"><strong>Pan-Asian Spring Rollers</strong></a> were one of two "exhibition" teams founded to attend - comprising of skaters from Beijing Roller Derby, Shanghai Roller Derby, Hong Kong Roller Derby (the three Chinese leagues), and Bangkok Roller Derby for Thailand.</p>
<p>Originally, the plan was for them to simply exist for the one tournament - a chance for those 4 leagues to share costs and make a more competitive roster together - but the Spring Rollers have quickly become something more.</p>
<p>Only a few weeks ago, Shanghai Roller Derby held their first ever public game, enabled by the existence of the Pan-Asian Spring Rollers as a team to play against them.</p>
<p>In a few weeks' time, Hong Kong Roller Derby also hold their first public game, ever, once again enabled by the Pan-Asian Spring Rollers.</p>
<p>The Pan-Asian Spring Rollers are represented by reps from each of their source teams, and we spoke to their Hong Kong Rep, Willow Whips (who also Captained PASR at Tomodachi), and their Bangkok Rep, Jean Claude van Slam about the new aims of PASR.</p>
<p>JC:"We all got on amazingly well [at the Tomodachi Derby Tournament], some of us meeting for the first time just hours before our first game. I think we all felt sad to depart afterwards partly for the awesome experience but also as new found friends.
It was after I chatted with members of Okinawa Roller Derby that the idea came to try and maintain the PASRs.</p>
<p>Beijing and Bangkok had talked before about the importance of maintaining the relationship between our teams as the key to growing this sport in Asia and so this seemed like the perfect opportunity to harness that enthusiasm and drive this new partnership into something long standing."</p>
<p>WW: "We have been working on a set of regulations and things like that, so the aim is that each team will try and host one event (a training session or a scrim) per year. Bangkok is planning on hosting a boot camp and scrimmage at the beginning of October, which will be open to anyone affiliated with Pan-Asian Roller Derby"</p>
<p>JC: For BRD, it's given members a new motivation for the sport, knowing that all that effort each week of learning and practicing drills has a chance to be put into real action, in addition to attracting new people to our team.</p>
<p>One of the issues for BRD being out further than the rest, is the travel costs. However, one of PASRs conditions for being a team member is to host at least one event per year so this should make for plenty of opportunities to choose from.</p>
<p>We hope that this will also help us to build recognition of the sport in Thailand and encourage more people to join. Just having those opportunities that has already made such a difference [to the team]"</p>
<p>WW: "The [long term] aim is to head back to Japan next year for the [next Japanese] tournament, now that we have played together a few times we will hopefully be even more badass!"</p>
<p>JC:"I hope that with the extended reach out to lone players in parts of Asia who don't currently have a home team, the PASR team might encourage new leagues to start in other Asian countries. That's yet to be seen but fingers crossed!!"</p>
<p>Willow: "If any teams want to join they just have to be in the region and put forward one representative from the team. If any individual skaters are in the area they are also welcome to sign up and train and play with us!"</p>
<p></p>

<p>The next fixture in this new East Asian derby calendar is against Hong Kong Roller Derby on the 17th June.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-20178" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/06/hkrd.jpg?w=300" alt="HKRD" width="300" height="300"></p>
<p>Hong Kong Roller Derby, which started out when founder Buffy SlayHers moved to Hong Kong from the USA in 2013, was inspired by an article listing "Top 5 Reasons HK Needs a Roller Derby Team" after realising that her new destination had no derby at all. As Buffy put it, "So I decided the best way to start was to "recruit " my friend, and roommate at the time, Glenda by having a roomie night and watching, yes, you guessed it, 'Whip It!' Now, before you start hating, and as cliche as it I, I think all of us love 'Whip It!' whether we have accepted the facts or not."</p>
<p>The team has had a bumpy ride - despite a huge amount of effort, the original Hong Kong Roller Derby collapsed in 2014, "I'm sure you all know the common difficulties many, if not all derby players face, but being in HK, made it that much harder. From difficulty in securing practice venues, to people moving away, and misunderstandings, our team fell apart and remained that way for over a year and a half."</p>
<p>Reformed now, for another go since 2016, the new Hong Kong Roller Derby has managed to grow to a healthy 19 skaters!  Buffy has drawn the following lesson from the two experiences: "It still seems like a dream, but [HKRD] is finally happening and has opened my eyes to why we had failed before. It all comes down to the people and the passion. Without community and support, we are nothing. But now our team is a family, and we realize we won't always agree but we will always have each others' backs and remember that in the end, we all want the same thing."</p>
<p>HKRD's A Team, the Yau Ma Titties, have put a huge amount of effort into organising this first bout (thanks to the previous derby experience of their founder, it's been easier than it might have been).</p>

<strong>Don't stop believing</strong> - that's the tune blasting out at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GlasgowMensRollerDerby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Glasgow Men's Roller Derby</strong></a> HQ where the Irn Brn are plotting a derby escape act which would make Houdini hop the apex with delight.
<p>This Saturday, GMRD play host to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/133440747209468/?acontext=%7B%22ref%22%3A%222%22%2C%22ref_dashboard_filter%22%3A%22upcoming%22%2C%22action_history%22%3A%22%5B%7B%5C%22surface%5C%22%3A%5C%22dashboard%5C%22%2C%5C%22mechanism%5C%22%3A%5C%22main_list%5C%22%2C%5C%22extra_data%5C%22%3A%5B%5D%7D%5D%22%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">final fixtures in the British Championships' Men's Tier 3 - Regional North group</a> (at Glasgow's ARC Sports Centre).</p>
<p>GMRD will be taking on their Celtic cousins, Men Behaving Derby (MBD), while Bairn City Rollers' Skelpies will be setting blasters to stun against Teesside Skate Invaders.</p>
<p>In a decidedly Scottish-type twist, only a specific combination of results can now see GMRD qualify for the play-offs.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, here's the short story:</p>
<p>In April, GMRD travelled to Dublin to play the Skate Invaders, winning by 234 points to 167. GMRD were later denuded of victory due to an eligibility malfunction, with the score becoming 200-0 in favour of the Invaders.</p>
<p>GMRD's next game against the Skelpies was then forfeited by the Falkirk team due to lack of numbers - a 200-0 win in favour of GMRD - leaving the table looking like this:</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-20255 aligncenter" src="2017/06/brd-table.jpg" alt="BRD table" width="1014" height="650"></p>
<p>Basically, GMRD need to beat MBD on Saturday - that's a pre-requisite if GMRD want a play-off place.</p>
<p><strong>Regardless of what flavour that victory lollipop is, the Irn Brn need to be sucking on it by Saturday evening.</strong></p>
<p>If the Skelpies win against the Invaders then victory of any variety will be enough for the Glasgow mob.</p>
<p>However, if the Invaders win <strong>and</strong> GMRD win then the three top teams will be tied on six points and it goes down to scores.</p>
<p>GMRD would need to have a better points differential than MBD to qualify for the play-offs.</p>
<p>Don't worry about crunching the numbers, SRD Blog has done it for you - <strong>GMRD need to beat MBD by over 123 points to be certain of a play-off place.</strong></p>
<p>That isn't going to be any kind of easy as MBD have already beaten both the Skelpies and the Skate Invaders this season, the latter with just 6 players!</p>
<p>That's why Hugs &amp; Kisses - GMRD's President - is sounding the rallying horn to the Irn Brn faithful.</p>
<p>"We need everyone in the West of Scotland and beyond to come out and support Saturday's double-header," he said.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20254" src="2017/06/18768309_10209728094985432_4231219290125343973_o.jpg" alt="18768309_10209728094985432_4231219290125343973_o" width="1600" height="1067"> The Irn Brn - photo by Laura MacDonald</p>
<p>"This is an amazing first for our city - a British Champs men's game at the home of Glasgow derby, the ARC sportscentre.</p>
<p>"You are going to see two gallus games of roller derby, with the fate of three teams hanging in the balance.</p>
<p>"Come out and support the Irn Brn as we attempt the great escape. We're confident we can put on a great show - don't stop believing, ken?"</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is traditional, we’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"><span class="s2"><b>Flat Track Stats</b></span></a> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <strong><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). Our new SRD Rank for June is out – the fourth for this year, with this years’ redesigned interface, allowing you to browse historical rankings for the last 10 years, view a map of all the active teams, select by country, gender, and get predictions of scores. (It also has some WFTDA rankings, including the 31 May ranking, as well as SRDRank.)</span></p>
