<p>This weekend marks a particular piece of history, as Scotland's northernmost league make their public debut. Orkney's ViQueens have been working hard on becoming bout ready since their founding in January 2017, and have taken less than 20 months to do so, which is fairly impressive work. This will be an away game, as is common for debut bouts, hosted in the Capital of the Highlands, Inverness.</p>
<p>Although Inverness City Roller Derby are the closest bouting league to Orkney, it will still be a 180 km trip, as the crow flies, for the skaters attending their first ever bout as a team. (Whilst Elgin is a closer location, direct, it's faster to get to Inverness, due to the need to land at a sea- or airport at the mainland.)</p>
<p>Inverness City Roller Derby themselves, whilst very experienced, have only 2 public bouts on record themselves, as the travel costs for Highlands teams are difficult in general. (We'd hope that, together with Helgin Roller Derby, and potentially new league Ullapool Slayers, the newly bouting Orkney would allow a small "Highlands Leagues" cluster to support more sustainable competition in the future.)</p>
<p>We caught up with Orkney ViQueens founder, DeafWish, to learn about the team's history and feelings at this critical point in their existence.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-27229 aligncenter" src="2018/08/orkneyviqueens.jpg" alt="OrkneyViQueens" width="370" height="370"></p>
<p><b>Orkney is a bit more isolated than the majority of locations for Roller Derby leagues. How have you been coping with the higher cost of travel - for your skaters, and for guests? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We know it’s not the easiest place to get to, so we offer to accommodate visiting skaters and coaches wherever possible.  We can also advise on cheaper routes and travel options. We try to make dates known as far in advance as we can, to help with being able to get cheaper options.  We also have some great support and sponsorship: [Orkney-based jewellers] Ortak will allow us to use some of their self-catering accommodation to host officials for when we have a game at home (hopefully next year!) and when we travel [Northern isles ferry operator] Northlink offer us a discount on ferry travel, which really helps.
</span>
<b>Whilst this is your first public bout, Orkney ViQueens have had a very active first year and half. What's been the most important thing the team has done? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Undoubtedly it’s been our bootcamps.  We had four in the first year, which let us progress to the next stage of our skills, learn from some amazing skaters, and meet people from other leagues who came to skate with us.</span></p>
<p><b>What have you been working on most, ahead of your first game? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The biggest challenge we have is being so isolated. We have no referees, NSOs or experienced skaters to help us navigate some of the more intricate penalties or elements of gameplay. We have been focusing on gameplay aspects like jam starts, responding to penalty calls, maintaining a pack and identifying people’s preferred roles.</span>
<b>
Inverness City have been a fixture of the ‘Northern’ cluster of Scottish Derby for a long while - how do your teams get on?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Both Inverness and Aberdeen's Granite City (our other nearest neighbour [by travel distance]!) are brilliant. We have had coaches and skaters from both come up to bootcamps with us, and they are always ready to answer our questions and offer advice and help. Natorious and Monica Yeller were our first bootcamp coaches so we are thrilled that Inverness are now our first opponents.</span>
<b>
What are your aims for your debut bout? Do you have a target score, just looking to play the game, or something else you want to do?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We would like to play the game well as a team. For us that means working together, developing confidence in our roles, keeping our penalty count down and having fun.  Inverness are an experienced team so they are going to be a challenge for us, which we are looking forward to!
</span>
<b>What's next for Orkney ViQueens? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Building our pool of officials to help us have a better grasp of the game and have more effective scrims, and also recruiting and training bench and LUM staff. We are lucky for this game to have Hydra (Rule 56 and Rainy City Roller Derby) benching for us and some of our pre-mins skaters and family having the opportunity to learn NSO and LUM roles in this game. We will then build on this knowledge going forward.  </span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">We have a busy few months coming up, with plans for another bootcamp with (Pay as you Feel Coaching's) Nuke and Udder in October; Granite City Roller Derby are coming for a skating holiday with us and we are hoping to have another away game in November. We are also continuing to develop our youth team, Orkney ViTeens, with after-school sessions.</span><b></b></p>

<span class="s1">We’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <span class="s2"><b><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">Flat Track Stats</a></b></span> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <b><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></b>.</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <b><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></b> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). (SRDRank also has recent WFTDA rankings, including the 31st June ranking, as well as SRDRank, and allows you to make predictions from them.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]</span></p>
(Note: we're especially likely to be missing items this week, as Facebook's response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal has resulted in them turning off large parts of the services we use to automatically collate events for this article. We don't think we've missed <i>too</i> much, but...)
<p>We're trying a new colour coding this week, to differentiate <span style="color:#800000;"><b>BOUTS</b></span> from <span style="color:#0000ff;"><b>RECRUITMENTS</b></span> and <span style="color:#993300;"><b>OPEN SCRIM</b></span>s, and <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>BOOTCAMP</strong></span>s.

<p></p>
<p>We're taking a break from Latin American tournaments you should be aware of, to highlight a tournament a bit more local to us, as it's a special year for it this time around.</p>
<p>Since 2014, Newcastle's Tyne &amp; Fear Roller Derby have hosted the "Men's European Cup", a late-autumn European-level MRDA-sanctioned tournament, although it skipped a year in 2017 (being sort-of-replaced by the first ever EuroClash). With the 2018 edition coming up in November 17th this year, we're hitting a sad landmark: this will be the last edition of the tournament hosted in the Walker Activity Dome, as a transfer of ownership makes continued booking impossible.</p>
<p>This means that 2018 is your last chance to experience the side-benefits of previous MECs, including exposure to a large number of friendly (and now kinda famous) dogs, in the canine-friendly venue.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-27193" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/08/mec2018_eur_map-big.png?w=2048" alt="MEC2018_EUR_map-big" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>This year's competitors cover a substantial chunk of Europe, from the best MRDA-members in England [Southern Discomfort (London), Tyne and Fear (Newcastle), Barrow Infernos (Barrow-in-Furness),  New Wheeled Order (Manchester) and Lincolnshire Rolling Thunder], through single teams from Finland (Helsinki Coast Quads), Sweden (Gothenburg Salty Seamen), Scotland (Glasgow Men's Roller Derby), Belgium (Manneken Beasts) and Spain (MadRiders).</p>
<p>Of these, Southern Discomfort, Manneken Beasts, MadRiders, Gothenburg and Lincolnshire Rolling Thunder are repeat attendees (along with the hosts!), the remainder are new this year, representing a shift towards UK-based teams overall.</p>
<p>MEC's schedule - unlike its WFTDA-aligned fellow tournament, EuroClash - is a seeded single-elimination tournament with single consolation games for first-round losers, two days being just enough time to fit the 13 games needed for that structure with 10 teams.</p>
<p>With British Champs giving three of the higher level competitors (Barrow, NWO and Tyne &amp; Fear) games against each other already this season, and MRDA playoffs qualification games generally making the UK crowd well connected, it's fairly easy to get a handle of on the overall distribution of the field - barring sudden surprises.
In particular, New Wheeled Order have had an absolutely brilliant year, as they continue to build on their triumph in 2017; they've already won the British Champs' "MRDA-side" Championship title for 2018, and also autoqualified for MRDA Champs before the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/795458060644171/"><strong>European Qualifiers</strong></a> on 18th August (which they're also <em>hosting, </em>but not competing in!).</p>
<p>In fact, MEQ will be a very good sample of what the high-end of MEC will look like, as four of its five competitors are shared with this competition (the exception being Nottingham Roller Derby's Super Smash Brollers).</p>
<p>Barring upsets on the 18th, the only team likely to stop NWO from taking the win here in Newcastle is also the only other UK team to have a automatic qualification to MRDA Champs: London's Southern Discomfort. With an unbroken series of wins at MEC, London's finest will be expecting to retain the championship this time as well.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Glasgow Men's Roller Derby are in the middle of application to MRDA<em>; as part of this, they've played a number of closed and open bouts against those above teams, particularly Southern Discomfort and Barrow Infernos. In general, GMRD have maintained their relative rating (in SRDRank) compared to their competitors, a solid middle of the pack in terms of attendees. GMRD's team to beat is Belgium's Manneken Beasts, who represent the mid-point of the field proper.
</em>we hear from other sources that they have been successful, but GMRD themselves have not publicly announced this.</p>
<p>In 2016, Gothenburg and MadRiders were both relegated to the consolation bracket, after the slaughter-pairings placed them against high seeds. Since then, both teams have improved in strength, judging from their records in FTS. (MadRiders are not MRDA members, and so do not have an official rating in Flat Track Stats - but SRDRank places them as generally competitive with the closely-matched lower half of the field in general) Gothenburg's performance increase has been more limited, and mostly driven by recovery from a difficult 2017 - their first year of MRDA membership.</p>
<p>Helsinki Coast Quads are the wildest card of the lot, having only a single game on record in Flat Track Stats (against the similarly low-on-stats Kouvola). We can expect to learn more about their abilities as they host their own, first, tournament in September (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/664371153907522/"><strong>Shake Me Up When September Ends</strong></a>). With fellow MEC competitors Glasgow Men's Roller Derby and Manneken Beasts making up the three in this round robin, this will be another exciting preview of the Newcastle tournament.</p>
<p></p>

<span class="s1">We’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <span class="s2"><b><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">Flat Track Stats</a></b></span> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <b><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></b>.</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <b><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></b> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). (SRDRank also has recent WFTDA rankings, including the 31st June ranking, as well as SRDRank, and allows you to make predictions from them.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]</span></p>
(Note: we're especially likely to be missing items this week, as Facebook's response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal has resulted in them turning off large parts of the services we use to automatically collate events for this article. We don't think we've missed <i>too</i> much, but...)

<p></p>
<p>For our third important, but easily missed, tournament this year, we're heading north to Colombia.</p>
<p>In common with Brazil and Mexico, Colombia began large scale national series relatively early.  From 2012 to 2014, a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TorneoRollerDerbyColombia/"><strong>Colombian National Tournament</strong></a> was organised, awarding wins to Bogotá's Rock N Roller Queens and Bone Breakers. Since then, however, things have been less consistent: whilst there has been a "Western Region" tournament every year since (the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/597182954013880/"><strong>Torneo Regional de Occidente</strong></a> ), and a "District Tournament" for the huge number of teams in the capital of Bogotá (the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TorneoDistritalRollerDerby/"><strong>Torneo Distrital Roller Derby</strong></a> ), there was not an overall National Championship in 2015 or 16.</p>
<p>Since 2017, however, things have been getting more on track, with Bogotá Bone Breakers winning both the 4th Distrital (for qualification), and the resulting <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/4nacionalrollerderby/">Torneo Nacional</a></strong> in mid-November, the first since 2014, to take the overall Championship for the year.</p>
<p>The previous Championship set up continues for 2018, and we're already deep into the Qualifying Tournaments, so there's plenty for us to catch you up on.</p>
<p>Due to the uneven distribution of teams across Colombia, the two qualifiers have very different geographical extents - although they have similar numbers of eligible competitors. From <em>each</em> qualifier, the top <em>three</em> teams are then passed onto the Championship itself, to play for the cup, so that six teams play overall.</p>
<p>Of the teams competing this year, the most experienced are Bogotá's Bone Breakers (Bx3), who date back to 2009. Only slightly younger are also a Bogotá based team, Rock N Roller Queens, who date from just a year later. These two are also the only WFTDA member leagues in Colombia - with the Queens having joined as early as 2013, and Bx3 waiting until 2016. Before and after WFTDA membership, both leagues' A teams have always been well travelled within Latin America (for example, attending several of 2x4 Roller Derby's Violentango tournaments in Buenos Aires).</p>
<p>Outside Bogotá, Manizales' Valkyrias are easily the oldest team, founded in 2010 as well. Valkyrias have also travelled fairly widely in recent years, having attended the 5th Sailor City Rollers hosted <em>Piratas en el Asfalto</em> tournament in 2017, also in Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale, we believe that Bogotá's youngest team in the tournament is Fugitivas Roller Punk, founded in 2016, whilst Cali's Silver Lynx Roller Derby are probably the youngest outside the capital region, dating from 2015.</p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p>The most geographically distributed Qualifier is the <em>Torneo Regional de Occidente</em>, covering the entire West of Colombia. (The East of Colombia has a very low population density, being mostly covered by those parts of the Amazon rainforest in the Colombian borders). <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/597182954013880/"><strong>This year's tournament</strong></a>, the 6th, was hosted by Medellín's Spring City Rollers, from the 9th to 11th June as a single event - a round robin tournament with 5 competitors.</p>
<p>Valkyrias Roller Derby, of Manizales, gave a very impressive performance, taking the top of the leaderboard, just above the hosts Spring City.</p>
<p>Silver Lynx Roller Derby, and Bucaramanga's Pink Sucks Roller Derby, were unable to prevent Violet Attack, of Ibague, from taking the third qualifying spot. This is a significant improvement in Violet Attack's performance from last year, although the absence of several teams from the tournament may have helped them.</p>
<p>From the results available to us, it appears that Valkyrias have significantly improved on last year, with only new-this-year Spring City causing them any particular challenge. (We've been unable to source complete scores for the tournament, however, so we can't be certain about the relative strength of third place holders Violet Attack.)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-27149" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/07/torneoregional3.png?w=1024" alt="TorneoRegional" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<hr>
<p>The second Qualifier, the <em>Torneo Distrital</em>, is centred entirely on the large capital city, Bogotá, and run as a round-robin with multiple fixtures throughout the year. Last year's District tournament was a huge affair with multiple divisions, and a packed structure (each fixture was a triple-header to accommodate all the teams).
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TorneoDistritalRollerDerby/"><strong>This year's Distrital</strong></a>, the 5th, is a much more compact affair, with all of the "B" teams, and the men's derby division, removed entirely.  Instead, the five big leagues of the capital area are all competing with their A teams only.</p>
<p>After the first round of play, the current standings in the Distrital are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Bogotá Bone Breakers</li>
    <li>Combativas Revoltosas</li>
    <li>Rock N Roller Queens</li>
    <li>Central Derby D.C. Roller Derby</li>
    <li>Fugitivas Roller Punk</li>
</ol>
This is also the ordering of the same teams at the end of the last National Tournament, so we're not expecting any particular upsets going forward.
<p>The final phase of the tournament, in this year's design, will see the top 4 seed into a slaughter-pairing elimination tournament, to decide the winner, second and third places. As such, it is impossible for the Fugitivas to qualify for a top 3 position, and thus impossible for them to qualify for a place in the Torneo National this year.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-27144" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/07/torneodistrital.png?w=1024" alt="TorneoDistrital" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<hr>
<p>The 5th Torneo Nacional will be hosted, in <strong>November 2018</strong>, by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ValkyriasRollerDerby/"><strong>Valkyrias</strong></a>, who gained the rights by qualifying first in June. There is no precise date announced yet, although we'd expect around the second week of the month, based on the previous tournament schedules. This is the first time the event has been held in Manizales, with three of the last 4 having been hosted in the capital, and the other (in 2013) in Medellín.</p>
<p>There are guaranteed changes to the finishing order from 2017, even at this early date: the three Regional teams qualifying this year are entirely different to 2017 (when Pink Sucks, Ibague's Pain Dealers, and the Titanias of Cali were the qualifiers).
Even so, the SRDRank ratings for the current top 3 Distrital division teams are all noticeably higher than those for the Regional qualifying teams (we place current-4th-position Central Derby D.C. as competitive with the Valkyrias, at last estimate).  All four previous Torneo Nacionals have seen the same top three teams, in fact, with various combinations of Bx3, Rock N Roller Queens and Combativas in each position; although for the first time last year, the Rock N Roller Queens were relegated to third place.</p>
<p>It is possible, then, that this could be the first year that the Valkyrias - who have the best form of any of the Regional teams - might make bronze, especially with home team advantage!</p>

<p>Two years ago, we <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/03/uks-first-coaching-summit-derby-stance/"><strong>reported</strong></a> on the first Derby Stance event: the UK's first ever "Coaching Summit", organised by North of England based coaching team Rule 56. Over a weekend of sessions from speakers across the UK (and one from the USA), the Roller Derby coaching community didn't just learn from each other, but also built some strong bridges and enthusiasm for pushing Coaching further in the sport.</p>
<p>In the year and a bit since that big launch, Rule 56 have been continuing to <a href="http://www.rulefiftysix.com/happenings/"><strong>develop coaching resources</strong></a>. With the aid of teleconferencing technology, they successfully provided a very effective short series of coaching webinars with Strong Athletic's Smarty Pants (as we <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/03/01/rule-56-now-coming-online-on-monday-6th/"><strong>reported</strong></a> <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/05/16/uk-coaching-rule-56-webinars-and-more/"><strong>on</strong></a> too), with attendees from across Europe and the Americas. They've also been running physical bootcamp sessions for skaters, like the upcoming "bite-sized" bootcamp on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1751163414965701/"><strong>Working in Walls</strong></a> on August 11th...</p>
<p>However, whilst there was a second <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1979086938976164/"><strong>Derby Stance</strong></a> summit in February (taking advantage of the Roller Derby World Cup the weekend before to bring all those international skaters to one place), organising truly large-scale international coaching events has always been difficult, especially with our grass-roots amateur sport.</p>
<p>Until now! This winter, Rule56 are bringing together all the things they've learnt to make the <em>third</em> Derby Stance a simultaneously larger, more international... and more <em>accessible</em> event - by moving it entirely online!</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-27125 aligncenter" src="2018/07/derbystance2018.png" alt="derbystance2018" width="828" height="315"></p>
<p><strong>Derby Stance Online</strong> will be a 4 day virtual event, running from <strong>29 November</strong> to <strong>2 December</strong> this year. Just like a physical event, there will be many different sessions to sign up with, grouped into 5 themes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Just Start Coaching [5 sessions]</li>
    <li>Strategic Coaching [4 sessions]</li>
    <li>Mental Performance [5 sessions]</li>
    <li>Game Day [3 sessions]</li>
    <li>Juniors [3 sessions]</li>
</ul>
as well as introductory and closing sessions, and a special session led by WFTDA's Beat-her Bones, representing WFTDA Education.
<p>Each of the 23 sessions will be available as a separate webinar, and can be signed up for (and paid for) independently of any others; of course, you can also sign up for the entire summit, as if it were a "physical" meeting as well, if you want. The flexibility of being able to pick and choose just the sessions you want, however, is a big advantage of the online-only format.</p>
<p>As with other webinars, the entire session will also be available to rewatch after the fact - so, even if your timezone makes it hard to attend the session live (or if you want to review a session later), you can still access all that coaching expertise, at your own convenience.</p>
<p>The other advantage of the online-only format is that it's immensely easier to pull together expert speakers and session leaders from across the entire globe. Rule 56 has managed to collect 14 of the best coaches in Roller Derby, and beyond, to contribute sessions to this event:</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-27123 aligncenter" src="2018/07/rule56__map-e1532701421288.png" alt="RULE56__map" width="1920" height="850"><strong>Smarty Pants</strong> (Strong Athletic), <strong>Vivien Leigh-thal</strong> (Rainy City Roller Derby), <strong>Booty Quake</strong> (Roller Derby Athletics), <strong>Maurine Filip</strong> (Stockholm Roller Derby), <strong>Rosie Peacock</strong> (Glasgow Men's Roller Derby, Team Scotland Coach 2018), <strong>Devoida Mercy</strong> (Philly Roller Derby), <strong>Maha El Nasser</strong> (Rule 56), <strong>Papa Whisky</strong> (Boulder County Bombers), <strong>Jess Paternostro</strong> (Team Canada Roller Derby), <strong>Furrrocious</strong> (Amsterdam Roller Derby)
<strong>Ballistic Whistle</strong> (Southern Discomfort), <strong>Louise Capicotto</strong> (Sport Psychology Consultant), <strong>Luludemon</strong> (Terminal City Rollergirls), and <strong>Treblemaker 909</strong> (Central City Roller Derby) are each contributing at least one session to the schedule (and some up to three).</p>

<span class="s1">We’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <span class="s2"><b><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">Flat Track Stats</a></b></span> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <b><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></b>.</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <b><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></b> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). (SRDRank also has recent WFTDA rankings, including the 31st June ranking, as well as SRDRank, and allows you to make predictions from them.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]</span></p>
(Note: we're especially likely to be missing items this week, as Facebook's response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal has resulted in them turning off large parts of the services we use to automatically collate events for this article. We don't think we've missed <i>too</i> much, but...)
<p>We're trying a new colour coding this week, to differentiate <span style="color:#800000;"><b>BOUTS</b></span> from <span style="color:#0000ff;"><b>RECRUITMENTS</b></span> and <span style="color:#993300;"><b>OPEN SCRIM</b></span>s, and <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>BOOTCAMP</strong></span>s.</p>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers/"><strong>Bairn City Rollers</strong>'</a> Central Belters are back on track and ready to kick some ass for the first time in 2018. On August 18th, they will be taking on Granite City's Fight Hawks at Grangemouth Sports Complex.
<p>This is the Belters' first game since early 2017 and sees a few changes to their team. Whilst some skaters have moved on or retired, the Belters have also had some new faces join their squad, including a couple of familiar faces that used to play elsewhere in Scotland.</p>
<p>The Fight Hawks had a great year in 2017, winning all five of the games they played. Now in 2018 they already have 3 games under their belt, the most recent a close bout against Dundee Roller Derby's Bonnie Colliders last weekend.</p>

<p>Chile's National Tournament, the mysteriously named <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TorneoX/"><strong>Torneo X</strong></a>, has been running for as long, or longer, than many of the better-known European tournaments, having begun in 2015. (The Men's Derby equivalent in Chile, Torneo X-MEN, started 2 years later.)</p>
<p>With the 4th event coming up at the start of next month, we're giving you a quick overview of the tournament and the players.</p>
<p>As Chile is a long, thin, country, as the tournament has expanded, it has done so mostly north/south, following the areas of highest population density. A bit like Scotland, Chile has a band of high population (in this case, roughly in the middle of the country), surrounded by low density rural areas to the north and south. Torneo X 2018 fills this entire high density area, for the first time in its history.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-26980 aligncenter" src="2018/07/torneox_map.gif" alt="TorneoX_map" width="600" height="568"> Torneo X's growth over time since inception.</p>
<p>In 2017, Chillán's Chillanrolleras retained the title from the previous year, maintaining an unbroken streak since they joined the tournament. However, Viña del Mar's Tacones Bandidos pushed them until the very last bouts for that title, so a repeat performance in 2018 is definitely not assured.</p>
<p>This is especially true as, with 2018's tournament growing to become the biggest yet, there are even more challengers for the cup. Especially likely to want to make a big splash are Santiago's Metropolitan Roller Derby, the only WFTDA-member league in the tournament, although it's their B-team, the Bayonetas, who are competing here.</p>
<p>Torneo X 2018 will consist of 4 fixtures across the coming months, spread across the competing regions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>1st</strong> Fixture: Osorno (Deskarriadas) <strong>4-5 August [<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/212354766088268/">EVENT</a>]</strong>
</li>
    <li>
<strong>2nd</strong> Fixture: Santiago (Adrenaline) <strong>8-9 September</strong>
</li>
    <li>
<strong>3rd</strong> Fixture: Viña del Mar (Tacones Bandidos) <strong>6-7 October</strong>
</li>
    <li>
<strong>Final</strong> Puerto Montt (Diosas Volcanicas) <strong>9-10 November</strong>
</li>

</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Chillanrolleras Derby Club</strong></p>
<p>Chíllan's premier team, and twice winners of the Torneo X, Chillanrolleras were bouting as early as 2013, although we have a gap in our records in 2015. From 2016, they've hosted multiple tournaments - including fixtures for the 2017 Torneo X itself - and have rarely lost a bout. SRDRank's current (unpublished) rating places them as the favourites to win the Torneo X title, and maintain their streak.</p>
<p>Chillanrolleras, as with many teams in Chile, have a brother league - Chillanrolleros - who share resources with them.</p>
<p><strong>Tacones Bandidos</strong></p>
<p>Tacones Bandidos are based in the coastal region of Vińa del Mar, Valparaíso. In their current form, they date from 2014, as a partnership with men's team, Bototos Bandidos.
The Tacones have had a pretty busy year to date - playing not just Chilean teams, but also Buenos Aires' Sailor City Rollers B, who they fought to a near-draw within the last month.</p>
<p>We'd rate the Tacones as likely to strongly contest the second place with the tournament newcomers from Santiago.</p>
<p><strong>Diosas Volcánicas Roller Derby</strong></p>
<p>Puerto Montt &amp; Puerto Varas's Diosas Volcánicas are one of the older teams in Chile, dating back to 2012, founded by Dahmenatrix from San Diego Derby Dolls. They're one of the most southerly teams in Roller Derby (and certainly in Latin America), with only a few teams in southern Argentina and New Zealand much more to the south.</p>
<p>They've had a difficult time finding practice space, and have had periods where most training was outside (in one of the wetter regions of Chile!). This year, they've finally achieved stable training space - in a local prison gym! - and have been working on recruitment and training more intensively since then.
Their aim for 2018 is to qualify for the finals (in the top 4 of the table)... and then who knows how high in 2019?</p>
<p><strong>Deskarriadas</strong></p>
<p>Deskarriadas are the largest team in Osorno, founded in May 2014. They're the hosts of the first fixture of this year's Torneo X, in the first weekend in August.</p>
<p>The Deskarriadas have been working towards the Torneo X all year, aiming to improve on their performance last year (where they placed 4th). In the first two years, they managed 2nd place, which is, we assume, their target for 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Adrenaline Roller Derby</strong></p>
<p>Adrenaline Roller Derby, one of two Santiago-based teams in the tournament, are the youngest contestants, founded in 2016. This relative youth has counted against them in ratings, and we'd consider them likely to be contesting in the same position as last year.</p>
<p>As hosts of the second fixtures in the tournament, home team advantage may well help them to beat expectations, in a fairly close lower half of the table.</p>
<p><strong>Indomitas RD Valdivia</strong></p>
<p>Roller Derby Valdivia consists of two member teams - the men's team, Indomitos, and the women's team, which used to be called Cuello Negro ("Black Swans"), but rebranded to Indomitas this year, whilst keeping the same logo. This rebrand was triggered by a complete rebuilding of the team, with the new "Indomitas" very different to the old 2015-2017 Cuello Negro in terms of skaters.
The Indomitas told us that they have spent the past year in intensive drilling, so that all their tactics are instinctive. They are prepared to demonstrate the heart, tenacity and perseverance that they can bring to the game.</p>
<p><strong>Nativas Roller Derby</strong></p>
<p>Temuco's first team, the Nativas date back to 2013. As with many of the teams here, they have "womens" and "mens" teams - although we can't find a name for the women's team except "Nativas Roller Derby". As one of the oldest teams in Chile, the Nativas competed in the first ever Torneo X, although they skipped the 2017 edition.</p>
<p>Due to a sparsity of bout data for the Nativas in FTS, we consider the returning team to be something of a wild card.</p>
<p><strong>Metropolitan Roller Derby B, Bayonetas</strong></p>
<p>Santiago's Metropolitan Roller Derby are the only Chilean members of the WFTDA, with their travel team currently ranked at 122 (May 31 ranking release) by WFTDA.</p>
<p>Their B-team, the Bayonetas, have existed since 2014, and are one of the few teams in this tournament to have played extensively internationally - at least within South America. Out of the Chilean leagues, they've played nearby Valparaíso's Tacones Bandidos most often, with wildly different results - beating them 2 to 1 early in 2017, and losing by a similar ratio by the end of that year.</p>

<strong>How long skating:</strong> <em>4 and a half years apparently! Time flies.</em>
<strong>How long captaining team:</strong> <em>About 8 months</em>.</p>
<p><strong>How has the season been for your team so far?:</strong> <em>We're only really just kicking into gear, but it's been great figuring out our team's strengths and helping build the confidence of our newer skaters. We had a great time in Portugal, where we may not have come back with any gold medals, but we came back with heaps of goals and ideas.</em></p>
<p><strong>How have you been preparing for the upcoming game:</strong><em> Following on from those pointers from our tournament in Coimbra, we've been drilling our weaknesses and honing our strengths. Practice, practice, practice!</em></p>
<p><strong>How do you find playing teams within Scotland, does it change your game prep playing such a geographically close league?:</strong> <em>As a team, the Hawks have played teams all over Scotland, a few in England, and even teams from Spain and Portugal. We haven't played the Colliders in a long time, but being closer to Dundee and knowing more of their skaters and their styles and preferences, we have a better idea of what kind of game we are going in to. As far as I'm concerned about geographical closeness, it means I can have a proper breakfast that's not from a service station and a bit of a lie in! Boost.</em></p>
<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you say to your team to get prepped for the game? Any words of wisdom?:</strong> <em>As a B team, we're here to learn constantly, and get as much from every game as possible. That doesn't mean we're not competitive however, it just means win or lose we're taking away valuable experiences.</em></p>

</em><strong>How long Captaining Team</strong><em><strong>:</strong> our first year!</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>How has the season been for your team so far?:</strong><em> It’s been a really good start, our focus skating as a team has been awesome! We constantly strive to do our very best, even if we lose a game we can still be really proud of each others performance.</em></p>
<strong>How have you been preparing for the upcoming game?:</strong><em> We've been pushing ourselves a lot at training. Working alongside the Tayzers to increase our knowledge of the game and to build our skills. </em>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>How do you find playing teams within Scotland, does it change your game prep playing such a geographically close league?:</strong> <em>We've played further afield against Copenhagen which was many of the Colliders' first game outside Scotland. Playing teams closer to home is just as exciting. Seeing the talent that Scotland has is incredible and being able to play alongside these people makes it all worth it. </em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>Is there anything in particular you say to your team to get the prepped for the game? Any words of wisdom?</strong><em> Don’t let the other team get into our heads! That every single person has an amazing set of skills to use, and not to forget it!</em></p>

<p>After this B-team-bust-up Granite's A team <em>The Northern Fights</em> will be taking on <em>Vagine Regime UK, </em>a team formed by a fully inclusive community of LGBTQIA+ individuals and their supporters across the UK. We put a few questions to each of the captains to understand the teams individual run ups to games.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-27098" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/07/37753945_1909703029096277_5673277440076546048_n.jpg?w=300" alt="Image Courtesy: Len Rizzo" width="300" height="199"><strong>Northern Fights Captain:</strong> <em>Lizzee Rascal #314</em>
<strong>How Long Captaining?:</strong> <em>First year
</em><strong>How Long Skating?: </strong><em>5 Years</em></p>
<p><strong>How has the season been for your team so far?</strong> <em>This season has been great so far. We had quite a change in the team at the beginning of the year and sadly said goodbye to old friends and welcomed some new ones. We have been focusing on British Champs, where we've been competing in Tier 3 North. It has been a fantastic challenge for us and has really pushed us to train hard. We have finished second in our tier and I couldn’t be prouder of the Fights.</em></p>
<p><strong>How have you been preparing for the upcoming game?:</strong> <em>We've been focusing on developing and building as a team for champs throughout 2018. The upcoming game, being an exhibition game, will be a refreshing change from this, with a lot of the pressure of champs being taken off. We have still been training hard and want to bring our best game at the weekend.</em></p>
<p><strong>How do you find playing teams such as VR? Does it change your strategy or prep at all?:</strong> <em>Playing against VR is a different experience for us, as they bring a pool of talent from across the UK and will perhaps use tactics that we haven’t been up against before which will make for a challenging yet fun game.</em></p>

<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>Vagine Regime captain:</strong> <em>Kami-Tazzy #360<img class=" size-medium wp-image-27096 alignright" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/07/37825317_1875280102519140_1499359558181584896_n.jpg?w=200" alt="Image Courtesy: Nick" width="200" height="300"></em>
<strong>How Long Skating:</strong><em> 7. 5 years</em>
<strong>How long Captaining:</strong> <em>First time for VR.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>How has the season been for your team so far, do rosters change a lot?:</strong> <em>It's been great so far. Back in April we had a tough but close game with the Rainy City C team, a great game to kick off the season with. We're really looking forward to playing Granite's awesome Northern Fights. VR UK contain a very large number of members, of all levels, from all over the UK, including some of the best players the UK can offer. Because of that, rosters are always changing, but it mainly depends on location, bout clashes, level and availability.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>How do you prepare your skaters for upcoming games?:</strong> S<em>ince skaters are generally from different leagues/teams it's difficult to prepare physically. Therefore communication and trust is key here. We'll have discussions on positions, and other strengths that everyone can bring. This will help the captains, LUM and Bench to come up with line up plans and strategies to fully challenge our opponents. It's certainly a bonus to have skaters on the team that have played together before, but things still may get shuffled around on the day to maximise our full potential.</em></p>
<strong>How do you find putting together a mixed team to play established leagues, is there anything in particular you look for in skaters?:</strong> <em>Depending on availability, we try to put together a strong as possible team to challenge our competitors to the max. We try to get the right mix of skaters of every position. However this is not possible at all times, we have had jammer heavy rosters in the past or vice versa. This is not really a problem, as a lot of the players are very adaptable and give it thier absolute all. We may be a challenge team but we're still a competitive team who like to rise to the challenge and aim to triumph in every game that we play.</em>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>Is there anything in particular you say to your team to get them prepped for the game? Any words of wisdom?</strong> <em>I ask them to bring all their focus, good sportsmanship and determination on and off the track. Additionally teamwork, integrity and to set individual as well as team goals. This sport is brilliant but it can also be mentally tough at times. One main advice I give to a lot of people is that if things don't go as planned in a jam, I encourage them to put it behind them, store it away if needed, reset and focus on the next jam. Also most importantly enjoy yourselves and embrace all the achievements, no matter how small or big they are.</em></p>
