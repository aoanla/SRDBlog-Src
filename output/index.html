<em>Editor's note: due to burn-out, and the increasingly obnoxious changes on the Wordpress backend, our end of year feature content has been delayed. We'll be releasing it over the next few weeks as we complete it. This is the first item in this content. We apologise for the delays incurred, and will update you all on the future of SRD when we know what that is.</em>
<hr>
<p>With the growth of Roller Derby worldwide, there has also come increasing regional organisation. Since 2010, and especially since the first Roller Derby World Cup in 2011 focussed thoughts on National structures, a number of nations, and nation-like entities, have begun organising various "National Tournaments" within themselves. At SRD, we consider these to be as important as any other large scale tournament - such as WFTDA or MRDA events - especially as they can also be more inclusive than such series due to reduced travel costs and membership requirements.</p>
<p>As such, we'd like to highlight the winners of each such tournament series we're aware of in 2018 - and briefly cover the tournaments themselves. As a historical resource, we also host a summary of all of the winners of the tournaments (and some references for them) here: <a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/NationalTournaments.html">National Tournaments (2010-)</a>
</p>
<h5>We'll start with the two largest such events (it's hard to judge which is larger, as they have exchanged places on various metrics year to year):</h5>
<hr>
<h4>UK&amp;Ireland ("<a href="https://www.britishchamps.com/">British Championships</a>")</h4>

<p>British Champs has been running since 2015, and has made various changes to its structure over the years (the most recent to improve inclusion and accessibility). It is structured as a multi-tiered divisional system, with each "skill level" tier divided into one or more geographical "divisions"; teams promote/relegate between tiers between seasons. Since 2016, Champs has officially run parallel tournaments for WFTDA- and MRDA- conforming teams, and has also allowed competition from non-A teams.</p>
<p>In 2018, the WFTDA-side tournament winners, topping Tier 1 convincingly were: <strong>Central City Roller Derby (Birmingham), </strong>not only winning every game against their opponents, but also achieving a significantly higher points difference than the second spot team, Liverpool.
2018 has been a good year for Birmingham teams, as the city's other team, Birmingham Blitz Dames, also hosted the first ever WFTDA Continental Cup in Europe later in the season.<strong></strong></p>
<p>The MRDA-side tournament  was topped extremely impressively by <strong>New Wheeled Order (Manchester M)</strong>, also delivering a huge points-difference advantage over second place Tyne and Fear. New Wheeled Order have had a very good few years, and we expect even more from them in 2019.
</p>
<h4>France ("Championnat de France Roller Derby")</h4>
The French National tournament series is, like the similarly sized British Champs, organised into Tiers by strength, and also loosely divided into geographical regions. (Unlike British Champs, there is competition across regions within a tier; also unlike BC, the Championnat is run directly as part of the French NGB, the FFRS.) The Championnat de France has <em>Feminin</em>- and <em>Masculin</em>- parallel tournaments; some leagues submit teams to the tournament which differ from their Travel teams, and the relaxed structure of the tournament also allows for "combined" team submissions from cooperating leagues. Unusually, compared to many of the other tournaments listed here, the French Championnat is fitted to the French sporting season (roughly following the European school year), and so starts in the previous winter, and finishes in the early summer each year.
<p>Repeating their victory in 2017, <strong>Nothing Toulouse (Roller Derby Toulouse)</strong> retained the French Championship this year. They remain one of the few non-WFTDA member leagues to hold a Championship position in their home country.</p>
<p>Undefeated champions since the Championnat started in 2016, <strong>Quad Guards (Toulouse M)</strong> continued their streak for another year in 2018.</p>
<hr>
<h5>Whilst the French and British tournaments are the largest, they are not the longest running National tournaments. Next, we're going to cover the longest running tournaments in modern Derby, the four which started in 2012:</h5>

<h4>Sweden (Swedish Roller Derby Seriespel)</h4>

<p>The Swedish National Tournament,  . Like larger tournaments, the Series is split into tiers ("serien"), with the Eliteserien being the top tier. More recently, Elite tier teams have been allowed to differ from the Travel teams for their league. There is only a WFTDA-gender tournament in Sweden, to date.</p>
<p>In 2018, <strong>Crime City Rollers (Malmö)</strong> retained their Championship title for the third year running, placing them one more victory behind Stockholm's streak of 4 wins (from 2012 to 2015).
</p>
<h4>Finland (Suomi Cup)</h4>
Finland's National Tournament is structured rather like the Swedish version, including the tendency of Elite tier leagues to submit non-Travel team rosters to the tournament. For the first time, in 2019 the Suomi Cup will be open to non-Finnish teams (making it an interesting extension of "National"), as St Petersburg Roller Derby A, the White Night Furies, compete.
<p>For the first time in 2018, <strong>Oulu Roller Derby</strong> achieved the Championship title, breaking a run of alternating wins by Helsinki and Kallio over the previous 6 years.</p>
<p>[Northern Finland also holds its own tournament - the Pohjola Cup - which started the tradition of welcoming non-Finnish participants in previous years via St Petersburg. So, in some ways, it sets the trend for its higher-profile southern relative.]
</p>
<h4>Mexico (Torneo Nacional de Roller Derby)</h4>
Mexico's National Tournament series has been organised by their national governing body, the Asociación Mexicana de Roller Derby, since it began in 2012. We've covered the leadup to the current season on the blog previously here: <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/07/18/mexican-national-championships-2018/">Mexican National Tournament article</a>. The series consists of a series of playoffs, selected by rating/ranking in the Mexican league tables (which work using the WFTDA rating scheme), with two divisions. As with many other nations, there are "varonil" and "femenil" parallel tournaments, corresponding to WFTDA- and MRDA- policies.
<p>In 2018, <strong>Mexico City Roller Derby</strong> retained their title for a three-year streak of victories, despite</p>
<p>In the Varonil side of the tournament, <strong>Disorder Roller Derby (Mexico City M)</strong> also began a streak, retaining their title from 2017.
</p>
<h4>Colombia</h4>
Whilst Colombia has run a National Tournament since 2012, the series has had a somewhat more complex past than the others in this category, with a couple of restructurings, and a hiatus from 2015 to 2016. In its current form, the Tournament consists of two parallel series - a multi-fixture tournament for Bogotá's many leagues (the "Torneo Distrito"), and a separate one for teams in the rest of Colombia (the "Western Region" tournament), with the top teams from both then competing at the Torneo Nacional finals. (<a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/08/01/the-5th-colombian-national-tournament-2018-so-far/">We've written more about the 2018 series here.</a>)
<p>2018's Champions, <strong>Bogotá Bone Breakers</strong>, also retained the Bogotá title in 2018, as well as continuing a three win streak in the national series (albeit across that 2 year gap).</p>
<hr>
<h5>Slightly less venerable than the oldest tournaments, but not in the size rank as Britain and France, our next grouping also covers a large geographical area.</h5>

<h4>Brazil (Brasileirão de Roller Derby)</h4>

<p>Brazil's national Championship, the Brasileirão, is a single-fixture event at present, which started as least as long ago as 2013 (there's some evidence it started earlier). Due to the distribution of teams in the country, it's semi-invitational, although the highest rated teams in Brazil always attend. (<a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/10/11/the-brasileirao-brazils-national-championships-at-8/">We've written more about the history of the tournament here.</a>)</p>
<p>2018's Brasileirão winners were <strong>Gray City Rebels (São Paulo)</strong>, retaining the title from 2017 (and resisting Ladies of Helltown's attempts to take back the title from 2016).
</p>
<h4>Chile (Torneo X / Torneo X-Men)</h4>
Chile has one of the youngest National Tournaments in Latin America, with the first Torneo X beginning in 2015. Year on year, it has gained more participants, and has had to change structure multiple times to accommodate this, currently using a playoffs and finals structure. For the first time in 2018, B teams have been allowed to compete, enabling Chile's strongest (and only WFTDA-member) league, Metropolitan Roller Derby, to compete with its Bayonetas.
Since 2017, there has also been a MRDA-gender tournament, the Torneo X-Men, run in parallel, and loosely associated with the original WFTDA-gender event.
(<a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/07/26/chilean-national-championships-2018-torneo-x-returns/"><strong>We've covered an intro to this year's Torneo X earlier on the blog.</strong></a>)
<p>For the first time ever, 2018's winners are a B-team: <strong>Bayonetas (Metropolitan B | Santiago)</strong>, taking a fairly commanding win in the final bout.
In the Torneo X-Men, which finished earlier in the year, <strong>Terror S-Quad (Santiago M)</strong> were victorious for a second time in a row.
</p>
<h4>Germany (Bundesliga Roller Derby)</h4>
The German National Tournament, or Bundesliga, formally started in 2015, as a multi-tier tournament run by the German NGB, Roller Derby Deutschland (RDD). In this form, its history has been tracked by Derbyposition.de since the beginning; the structure is much like the much larger French and British tournaments, but without the need for multiple geographical divisions, due to its smaller number of teams. (There were two previous events which might count as "German National Tournaments", in 2010 and 2013, but they are not part of the modern event.)
As with several other National series in nations with very high rated WFTDA-member leagues, those leagues have begun sending "non-Travel teams" to represent them in the tournament.
<p>For the first time in the tournament's history, <strong>Dresden Pioneers</strong> comprehensively won the Bundesliga Division 1 in 2018.
</p>
<h4>Australia (Australian National Tournament &amp; Australian Men's Nationals)</h4>
Unusually, Australia has not had a formally denoted "National Tournament" for WFTDA leagues (although you could claim that the Great Southern Slam counts, given the scope of its attendance). The Australian Men's Roller Derby organisation, on the other hand, has organised an Australian Men's Nationals since 2015, as a single fixture tournament towards the end of the year.
More recently, an unusual "State-teams" style National Tournament has been launched (for the first time in 2018), with WFTDA- and MRDA- gender legs, but we're not sure if this counts as a National tournament in the same sense as the other events in this list.
<p>In 2018, <strong>Victoria Men's Roller Derby</strong> won the Australian Men's Nationals, having lost it for the first time ever in 2017 (to Tasmania!).</p>
<hr>
<h5>For our final grouping, we have another eclectic selection of Nations, all united in having run a National series for 3 years or less.</h5>

<h4>New Zealand (Top 10 Championships)</h4>

<p>New Zealand's "Top 10 Championships" have been running since 2016, although information on the second year of their organisation is a little patchy due to website bitrot. In general, the series is a flat round-robin style event, distributed across the year, with no tiering or geographical structure. As far as we are aware, there's only a WFTDA-gender version of the tournament so far.</p>
<p>In 2018, <strong>Dead End Derby (Christchurch)</strong> won the Top 10 Championships for the first time (ending Wellington's Richter City's streak of 2 years).
</p>
<h4>Spain (Campeonato Nacional de Roller Derby)</h4>
The Spanish National tournament is a single event affair, due to the relatively small number of potential competitors in Spain at present. Organised by the Spanish National Governing body, the single tournament sees the top teams in the country play for victory in a single elimination structure. The event has run since 2016, with an additional MRDA parallel event introduced in 2017.
<p>In 2018, <strong>Roller Derby Madrid</strong> continued their unbroken win streak since the start of the competition.</p>
<p>Similarly, 2018's winners in the other division were <strong>MadRiders (Madrid M)</strong>, also continuing an unbroken win since last year.
</p>
<h4>Austria</h4>
Austria's National tournament only started in 2017; before then, there was effectively only one sufficiently developed team in the country (Vienna Roller Derby), and so no way to hold such an event. Due to the small number of teams, the Austrian National Championship is a single fixture event; and due to the dearth of MRDA teams, it has only a WFTDA leg.
<p>In 2018, <strong>Vienna Roller Derby</strong> retained their title from 2017, although competition within the rest of the teams was strong, Vienna have a significant experience advantage in their country.
</p>
<h4>South Africa (National Derby Fest)</h4>
South Africa have held a National Championship event since 2016, although that first event included "home teams" from some of the leagues involved. As South Africa has very few leagues with travel teams, this event is a single fixture which also focuses on developing the sport within the nation. (<a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/10/31/south-africas-national-derby-fest-2018-three-years-of-festivals/">We've written more about the history of the event here.</a>)
<p>In 2018, Johannesburg's <strong>Golden City Rollers</strong> retained their win streak since the dawn of the tournament.
</p>
<h4>Belgium (Roller Derby Belgium National Tournament)</h4>
Finally, we come to the newest National tournament in our list: Belgium. The Belgian national tournament, organised by rd.BE, the Belgian NGB, ran for the first time this year, as a year-long series of round-robin fixtures within tiers. (Initial tiers were drawn from FTS Europe ratings.) From the start, the rd.BE event has had a WFTDA- and an MRDA- leg.
<p><strong>Antwerp Roller Derby (One Love Roller Dolls)</strong> are the first ever holders of the rd.BE Championship title.</p>
<p>In the MRDA leg, Brussels' <strong>Manneken Beasts</strong> achieved the first ever Championship.</p>
<hr>
<h5>Special mention:</h5>

<h4>Japan (Derby Nights 4x4)</h4>

<p>Whilst it's structure is rather different to every other event in this list, we should note that Japan has also had a Tokyo-series first for the first time in 2018. The Derby Nights 4x4 ("DN4x4") series was a multi-fixture event with "womens" and "mens" legs, open to leagues of all affiliations in Japan. (As such, the women's division included both the World Skate/FIRS affiliated Spiral Cats, and all of the WFTDA-affiliated leagues in the Tokyo metropolitan area, from Tokyo Roller Derby to the independent Kamikaze Badass.) This was a unique ruleset, with, we believe, 4 skaters per competing team, and very short period and jam lengths.</p>
<p>In 2018, <strong>Neon Roller Monsters</strong> (the submitted team from Tokyo Roller Derby) won the women's division.
The new-in-2018 team, <strong>Tokyo Bar Hoppers</strong>, won the men's division (which had only 2 teams this year!).</p>
<p>We're excited to see what happens with this tournament format, and if it expands beyond the Tokyo region to the rest of Japan.</p>

<p>Continuing our series of guest posts, we're keeping topical with a review of Namur Roller Girls' league management web app, TrackKarma by Glasgow Men's Roller Derby's Rosie Peacock.<br><br><strong><a href="https://www.trackkarma.com/">TrackKarma</a></strong> is completely free to use*, although it can only be used as a web application (there is no self-hosting option). The self-reporting on the website says that, at the time of publication, 376 leagues are currently using the service. At present, the service is available in both English and French, and has no user limits.</p>

<!-- /wp:separator --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Trackkarma (TK) is an app (well, a website that runs like an app) developed by Namur Roller Girls.<br>Their launching blurb is as follows….<br>“Ever dreamed of teams charters, training sessions, attendance, league agenda and directory all gathered in one single tool?<br>Here it is: TrackKarma, the application that will change the world (or at least your league).<br>In TrackKarma, members can:</p>

<li>Manage their player profile and import a cute picture</li>
<li>Check monthly agenda of games and training sessions</li>
<li>Inform of their absence at practice</li>

<i>We don't normally comment on current events in roller derby on this blog. However, the current shocking events in the UK Roller Derby community have been spreading rapidly, and we felt it would be useful to have an objective location collating the information available. In the past 24 hours, there has been a lot of discussion and horrified reaction, and many responses from across the community; we would not want these to be missed. </i>
<hr>
<p>The UK roller derby community has been shocked this week by revelations that a female NSO appeared in court to answer sexual offence charges.</p>
<p>Laura Nixon-Corfield (known within the community as Sara Tonin) was sentenced after admitting to having and distributing images of child sexual abuse. Over 800 images were cited in the court report, with children picture aged between 1 and 12 years. She received a two year suspended jail sentence, and a 10 year registration on the Sex Offenders register.</p>
<p>The details are reported in the press here: (warning, descriptions of images and messages sent relating to the images have been included in reports):</p>
<p>Manchester Evening News - <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/nhs-worker-downloaded-images-children-15549518">https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/nhs-worker-downloaded-images-children-15549518</a></p>
<p>Daily Mirror - <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nhs-workers-double-life-online-13729460">https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nhs-workers-double-life-online-13729460</a></p>
<p>Nixon-Corfield had NSO’d and THNSO’d a number of events, working with leagues in both the UK and global community, including the 2017 MRDA Championships in Wales, and National and International tournaments in the current year.</p>
<p>Leagues and organisations Nixon-Corfield has been affiliated with in the past published statements that detailed lifetime bans from leagues and events. Their statements unanimously stated that they were unaware that she was going through any legal proceedings, and did not know that she faced sexual offence charges relating to children.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/RainyCityRollerDerby/posts/10156449538209681">In a post on Rainy City Roller Derby’s Facebook page</a>, league president Evan Lawrence said: “The Board of RCRD wants to reassure the derby community and the public that we treat the safety of our members and fans incredibly seriously and on discovering this information we have taken immediate action.</p>
<p>“They have been immediately removed and banned from the league, permanently banned from our venue, and any events at which Rainy City is participating.</p>
<p>“We have notified WFTDA, UKRDA, JRDA and British Champs and we are working with them to make sure that we are able to provide a safe space for everyone within the community.</p>
<p>“We are providing counselling for all our members and will also be consulting with local expert organisations for further advice on how to support the league and the derby community.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterRollerDerby/posts/2119046081488805">Manchester Roller Derby made their own post,</a> explaining that while Nixon-Corfield had previously been a member, they had left the league some time ago, although she had still NSO’d at some of their events, as a local official.</p>
<p>The statement, in part, reads: “Manchester Roller Derby condemns their actions in the strongest possible terms. The safety of our members, their families, the wider derby community and anyone else who may be in attendance at our events is of the upmost importance to us and a priority for the league.</p>
<p>“We find it deeply regrettable that they continued to participate at our events despite having reported themselves to the authorities and despite consciously attending events where junior skaters were present.”</p>
<p>It continues: “In light of the above, and as a safeguarding measure, Manchester Roller Derby have issued a permanent lifetime ban to prevent Laura Nixon-Corfield from attending any Manchester Roller Derby related activities or events.”</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ukrollerderbyassociation/posts/2237443319621953">the UKRDA has issued a lifetime</a> ban from any events organised by a UKRDA member league, including British Championships. They also join the long list of entities which have contacted the WFTDA, MRDA and JRDA on this matter.</p>
<p>British Championships also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BritishRollerDerbyChamps/posts/1011802455673545">issued their own statement</a>, confirming that Nixon-Corfield had been banned permanently "from participation in all WFTDA, MRDA, UKRDA, JRDA, and British Championships events and groups effective immediately." and affirming that "We are unified in our condemnation of these disgusting and harmful crimina<span class="text_exposed_show">l act". </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nottinghamrollerderby/posts/2325725211005984">Nottingham Roller Derby</a> confirmed that they have no ongoing relationship with her.</p>
<p>There is currently an ongoing process in several organisations concerning improvements in safeguarding and vetting procedures to limit the possibility of this occurring again, and to help protect children in future.</p>
<p><i><strong> </strong></i>Update: the MRDA has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1963676190376371&amp;id=114448265299182">also issued a statement</a>, revoking Nixon-Corfield's registration, and banning her worldwide from their events. All MRDA leagues have been informed of this decision.</p>
<p>Update (2): the WFTDA has now also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10156889296479111&amp;id=88510014110">made a short statement</a>, also confirming a WFTDA-wide ban, and affirming support for, and solidarity with, their member league Rainy City.</p>

<p>Although we've written a lot on SRD [<a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/09/27/ranking-of-roller-derby-internationally/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/08/ranking-the-world-and-other-fts-visualisations/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/11/03/srd-rank-november-update/">3 </a>,<a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/17/meanwhile-in-europe-the-daga-denter-tournament-2016/"> 4</a> etc] and privately [<a href="https://aoanla.wordpress.com/2015/05/31/british-championships-premier-tier-some-statistics/">1</a>,<a href="https://aoanla.wordpress.com/2016/09/27/ranking-mechanisms-from-sport-and-roller-derby/">2</a>,<a href="https://aoanla.wordpress.com/2018/02/09/the-2018-roller-derby-world-cup-rating-and-pairing-a-postmortem/"> 3</a>etc] on rating and ranking Roller Derby over the years, the question of how to do this fairly in WFTDA has been another topic of discussion recently. <br>Like Tennis, and many other sports, the WFTDA "rankings" (which are really a rating) are not slaved to the ordering of any particular tournament, including WFTDA Championships - meaning that it is possible for the current WFTDA Champions to not also be #1 in the Rankings released at the end of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>Statistically, this is, of course, not a problem, but the position is still counter-intuitive to some members of the community. Some blame the specific construction of the WFTDA rating system itself, whilst others simply believe that Tournaments should supersede mathematical methods for determining rating. <br>As a result, every year when the WFTDA Championship winner does not automatically become the WFTDA #1 rated team, the question of "how good are WFTDA Ratings?" is raised again.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>In the spirit of this, we decided to actually test this, rather than just complaining about an aspect of the rating we didn't like. <br>Using Flat Track Stats' records of all Roller Derby bouts, we selected the entire history of all WFTDA Sanctioned bouts in the history of the sport, all the way back to 2005. Using these, we calculated what the ratings and rankings would look like now, if we used various methods for rating teams.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system"><strong>"Elo" ratings</strong></a>, named for Arpad Elo, who developed them initially to rate performance of Chess players, are a particularly easy kind of rating to implement. As a base comparison to our other ratings, we wrote a very quick Elo rating for WFTDA Sanctioned bouts, based entirely on Win/Loss records: the rating does not care how much a team won or lost by, just that they <em>did</em>.<br><br>We'll compare this to three other ratings:<br><strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">FTS (WFTDA)</a></strong>: the Flat Track Stats rating, as optimised for WFTDA Sanctioned bouts. FTS is also an Elo rating, although its updates take into account the degree of success, not just that a team won; it also has a couple of other factors to account for things like home team advantage. <br><strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRank.html">SRDRank (v2)</a></strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRank.html">:</a> this blog's in-house rating scheme. We've <strong>written</strong> a lot about this before, but it's essentially an entirely different kind of rating scheme to Elo; rather than updating pairs of teams on each game, SRDRank is a <em>Massey-style</em> scheme, which tries to produce consistent ratings to explain all of the games in its "purview" at once. This version of SRDRank was optimised for monthly predictions, against the world, not just the smaller subset of WFTDA Sanctioned games.<br><strong><a href="https://wftda.com/category/rankings/">WFTDA</a></strong>: the official WFTDA rating and ranking, which is used to rank teams for selection into the official WFTDA tournaments. WFTDA ratings are specifically designed to be "easy for people to understand" without specialist knowledge, as well as, presumably, aiming to reflect the history of performance of their member leagues.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

<h4>Predictive accuracy</h4>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>The key conflict between expectations of Rating systems and the reality, is often one between "prediction" and "postdiction".</p>

<p>"<em>Prediction</em>" is, of course, using a rating to guess what a future result would be, by comparing the ratings of the competitors previously.<br>"<em>Postdiction</em>", conversely, is using a rating to judge "how well" two teams have performed, over their recent history.</p>

<p>Whilst it may seem that the two are closely related, in fact, it isn't inherently true that a rating which has high accuracy at one is also highly accurate at the other. In general, prediction is harder than postdiction - it's always hard to guess what's going to happen beforehand - but for teams whose strength has varied a lot over their season, it also can be hard for a postdictive approach to represent their "overall performance" in a satisfying way.</p>

<p>In neither case, of course, does "high accuracy" mean "always places the winner of a particular tournament at #1". All rating systems are statistical, and try to produce the best overall measure of performance, for all teams, and all possible contests. The difference between the top teams is just as relevant as those between the middle and lowest rated teams.</p>

<p>Equally important to the accuracy of a rating - at either task - is the frequency at which it is updated. Elo ratings, including the FTS ratings, are designed to update every time a game happens, so their accuracy can be measured either side of a given result. Some other ratings are published less frequently - WFTDA's ratings are monthly to bimonthly, depending on the time of year, and SRDRank is <em>designed</em> to produce predictions no faster than daily. Frequent ratings aren't necessarily the "best" ratings, especially for postdiction - a "long-term overview" can sometimes produce a better overall view of historical performance than a rapidly updated one focused on bout-by-bout changes; but for prediction, especially in the middle of tournaments, it's usually best to have all the most recent information available for your next bet.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, we've plotted the performance of four different ratings, at both postdiction and prediction, when we take updates at yearly, quarterly, monthly, fortnightly, and "bout-by-bout" intervals. For some rating schemes, not all intervals were available: FTS doesn't easily provide "historical rating" collections for anything more frequent than quarterly results. (We have a single data point for the FTS "bout-by-bout" period, for prediction, thanks to Ioan Wigmore.); WFTDA ratings are not updated faster than monthly at best; SRDRank doesn't produce "bout-by-bout" updates for this kind of data.</p>

<p>In all cases, the postdiction accuracies (as percentage "correct") are shown by triangles, and the prediction accuracies by circles; the same colour is used for a given rating scheme. More "rapid" updates are to the left of the graph.</p>

<!-- wp:image {"id":27847} -->

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="2018/12/screen-shot-2018-12-10-at-22-28-40.png" alt="" class="wp-image-27847"><figcaption>Success rates for prediction (calling games ahead of time) and postdiction (representing performance after the fact) for 4 rating systems, with different time bases.</figcaption></figure><!-- /wp:image --><p>The first thing that should be clear is that postdiction is, in general, easier than prediction: <em>every</em> rating has a higher postdiction accuracy than prediction accuracy, for every update period.</p>

<p>The Elo rating has some of the highest postdiction accuracies, partly because it responds "fully" to every win or loss: a win counts 100%, even if it was a narrow victory, so each result pulls the rating around strongly, making it reflect history. This tendency to be "recency-biased" also explains why its postdiction gets "better" on shorter updates: a "weekly" postdiction only has to represent the last week of play accurately, and that's what Elo is best at. When we need the Elo rating to represent an entire year of performance, its bias towards the most recent month harms it overall.</p>

<p>That same effect, also means that the Elo rating is also the worst at prediction: because it counts all wins equally, a single narrow upset can throw off any trend it was measuring.</p>

<p>SRDRank and FTS are closely matched for the update periods where they can be compared, with SRDRank having a slight advantage in prediction, and a noticeable one in postdiction; by comparison, the WFTDA rating is worse than all other ratings at postdiction, except on the yearly scale, and only better than the Elo rating at prediction. SRDRank is particularly good at "yearly review" postdiction: representing the entire year's performance overall; this is because of design decisions which mean that it considers an 18 month period of games in order to make its rating evaluation. The same "long term" view means that its postdictions are worse at reflecting "short term" history than the recency-focused Elo, although it still out-performs every other metric at this task.<br>The WFTDA rating, meanwhile, is hampered by having a maximum amount it can respond to any "strength change", meaning that it struggles to keep up with the more performant ratings on postdiction; and its simple rating calculation is not sophisticated enough to predict well.</p>

<p>For prediction, the "sports prediction" literature generally considers accuracies above about <strong>70%</strong> to be excellent. On that measure, only two ratings are excellent for Roller Derby prediction: SRDRank (fortnightly or weekly updates), and FTS ("bout by bout", although it is likely that it would also be excellent on the same timescales SRDRank is). It is likely that better than 75% or so win/loss prediction accuracy is impossible for Roller Derby: there are always closely-matched games which "could go either way", which even an accurate algorithm will guess wrongly about half the time by definition.<br>We should also say that, by this measure, the WFTDA rating isn't that bad at all, only just missing out on that 70% benchmark, although it's not in the same class as the other two schemes.</p>

<p>For postdiction, there are less expectations on excellence, as the difficulty is partly dependant on how "variable" the sport is. The ~85% accuracy attained by Elo (quarterly or shorter) and SRDRank (yearly) is exceptional, however. The WFTDA rating actually does fairly well at "yearly" postdiction - summarising the years' performance in a single measure - but it is worse than every other metric when applied on a more frequent basis.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->

<h5>Predictive Accuracy (with close misses)</h5>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>As we mentioned above, simply judging a rating on its ability to call wins and losses causes problems when evaluating close games. A good rating will predict that a close bout will be close; but inevitably, random chance will cause it to be wrong about which one of the contestants will actually win.</p>

<p>There are several ways in which we can correct for this issue: we can move to measuring the success at predicting actual score-lines (not just winners and losers), but this is hard to compare for our metrics (mainly as the Elo rating isn't designed to predict score-lines); or, we can give credit to the rating for results it gets wrong<em> if the game was close, and the rating predicted it to be close.</em></p>

<p>[As an aside: SRDRank was actually optimised against the first metric: getting score-lines as close as possible, for the entire world's history of games.]</p>

<p>As an example of how this changes our evaluation of ratings, we've graphed the accuracies of the Elo and SRDRank ratings again, for both pre- and post-diction. This time, we've included a second set of points for each: the success measured, including games which the rating called the winner wrong, but correctly predicted the result to be close either way (within 10% on the scoreline).</p>

<!-- wp:image {"id":27850} -->

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/12/screen-shot-2018-12-11-at-13-14-51.png?w=700" alt="" class="wp-image-27850"><figcaption>Success rates for prediction and postdiction for 2 rating systems, including successes on calling close games as close (regardless of who won).</figcaption></figure><!-- /wp:image --><p>As you can see, including "close games" results in a significant boost to our evaluation of all the metrics, although it does not "reverse the order" of any of our ratings in terms of relative performance. (Notably, SRDRank's yearly postdiction now narrowly beats all comers when you include close games, even defeating Elo's best postdiction with close games.)<br>Although we did not include them on the graph (in order to make the graph still somewhat readable), we'd expect similar gains for the FTS and WFTDA ratings; an average of around 2% additional "successes" for each test.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->

<h5>Best Rating for a Job</h5>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>Given the metrics above, we can attempt to select the "best" ratings to use for a particular task. We've selected four representative tasks, and mapped them to the mode (pre- and post-diction) and "timescales" on which they operate, to select recommendations, and warnings, on the approaches you should consider.</p>

<p><strong>Season Review</strong> is the task of summarising, as best you can, the overall performance of the field over the past season. This is a postdiction task, on a long timescale (six months to a year). This is also a very closely contested task, and there's not much to call between all 4 ratings.</p>

<p><strong>Medium-term Prediction</strong> is the task of predicting results several weeks to months in advance, to plan tournaments and games.</p>

<p><strong>Play-by-Play Prediction</strong> is the task of predicting results on the minute, judging your next game at a tournament, for example. </p>

<p><strong>Medium-term Review</strong> is the task of summarising, the overall performance of the field, on the scale of months. This is the "coaching" metric, when judging how well your team is evolving. For this, second place is very tight.</p>

<p>We can also (bearing in mind the relative expectations of accuracy, as discussed in the rest of this article), generate the full "rankings" for all of the WFTDA member leagues for 2018. (The WFTDA Ranking here is the one from 30 Nov 2018, the most recently available ranking and rating from WFTDA).<br>We present here the top 20, with ratings, from each scheme - notice that, despite the differences, there are far more similarities than disagreements.<br>(Ratings are <em>truncated</em> for space: the error introduced by truncation rather than rounding is much smaller than the expected error on the ratings themselves, so this is not an issue.)</p>

<!-- /wp:table --><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --><h5>All WFTDA Leagues (graph, image)</h5>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>As we've previously discussed, however, strict rankings are a bad way to represent the performance of teams. It's much better, even with 1-dimensional ratings, to report those ratings, providing a better measure of the "distance" between teams, than to imply that all teams are equally "1 better" than the team immediately "below" them in ranking.</p>

<p>As such, we've generated a graph of all the teams rated by at least one of our ratings in their yearly review. We order the teams in "WFTDA ranking" order, with teams not in the official WFTDA ranking placed at the end. <br>In order to provide a good comparison, we've rescaled all the ratings to represent logarithmic relative strength, compared to the "top" team in the rating*. (That is: for every "1" difference in rating, the better team is expected to score about 2.7× as much in a game; for every "2" difference, 2.7<sup>2</sup>× (7.4×), for every "3" difference, 2.7<sup>3</sup>× (20×) and so on.)<br>This image is unavoidably large in order to be legible; click the preview to get the full-size version.<br>Note that the full range of the entire rated cohort for all ratings is about <strong>8</strong>, corresponding to the top 3 teams being expected to score around <strong>3000×</strong> more points than the bottom 3 (or, effectively, a complete shutout).</p>

<!-- wp:image {"id":27849} -->

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/12/rating-performance-sheet3-crp.gif?w=700" alt="" class="wp-image-27849"><figcaption>All WFTDA Member Leagues, displayed in WFTDA 30 Nov 2018 order (with extras not in that rating appended after), with all their ratings. (Ratings scaled to the same type for direct comparison.)</figcaption></figure><!-- /wp:image --><p>It's worth noting that, in general, there's still a reasonable agreement on the overall "shape" of the rating; the ratings all broadly agree on the strength difference between the top and bottom ends of the list, and whilst there are disagreements in order, there's also a lot of agreement about the overall place of most teams.<br>It's also possible to see how the "difference in skill between ranks" changes: the steeper the slope of the curve, the more change there is in relative skill as you change ranking. For WFTDA Member leagues, there seems to be a relatively flat middle section, where adjacent teams are actually very close in strength; at the top end, there's a much steeper rating change with rank, until the curve flattens again around the top 3 or 4. (All the ratings pretty much agree that Victoria and Rose are near-tied in the top 2, they just disagree about which is a tiny sliver ahead.)</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>We've given an overview and test of the official WFTDA rating scheme, versus 3 contenders for a range of use cases.<br>Contrary to some complaints, the WFTDA rating scheme turns out to be a pretty good rating, for post-diction, on the longer timescales. <br>More sophisticated schemes do better than it at almost all tests, but its performance, given its simplicity and the trade-offs it makes to try to prevent high-skill teams playing low-skilled teams for blowouts all the time, is acceptable.<br>Also, this test run underlines just how hard it is to make gains in predicting (or postdicting) game results: the gap between the worst and best performing metrics in this test is never more than 10%, and the gap between the "good" ratings tends to be around the 1% level. <br>We do note that, for prediction, Flat Track Stats attains class-leading performance, especially on short time scales. (It is just as good when rating European teams, MRDA teams, or any other region where it has an actively calculated rating.) We'd encourage regions which do not have their own rating scheme to contact Flat Track Stats to host such a thing for them. (The other benefit to this is that you have a place to store all your results: Flat Track Stats is also a public repository of all the game data which is uploaded to it.)</p>

<!-- wp:separator -->

<p></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator">
<!-- /wp:separator --><p>*WFTDA estimated strength differences are calculated using the predicted strength ratios in the WFTDA algorithm, <em>not</em> the predicted "points gained". Other calculators use the points-gained formula, as they're interested in seeing how the rating <em>changes with results</em>: we're interested in how strong WFTDA's rating <em>actually</em> thinks teams are, which is different. (The fact that these <em>are</em> different for WFTDA is why sufficiently strong teams can't play weak teams without losing overall rating: points gains doesn't keep pace with strength difference. None of the other rating schemes in this article have this behaviour.)</p>

As always, we’re using <span class="s2"><b><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">Flat Track Stats</a></b></span> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <b><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></b>.</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <b><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></b> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts).

<p>Whilst it skipped a year in 2018, due to the potential conflict with the Roller Derby World Cup, one of the most important events in European Roller Derby is returning for 2019.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2063064350378242/"><strong>European Roller Derby Organizational Conference</strong></a> will be 10 years old at the time of its next edition, running from January 31st through February 3rd 2019, in its usual host city of Berlin.</p>
<p>Since 2009, EROC has provided a place for the entire European derby community to come together to share experience, build contacts, and plan the future. It's been an invaluable starting point for several of the European National Governing Bodies, as well as helping to seed derby future across the continent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/?attachment_id=27817#main" rel="attachment wp-att-27817"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-27817" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/12/eroc2019.jpg?w=700" alt="" width="700" height="700"></a></p>
<p>Regular hosts, <strong>Bear City Roller Derby</strong>, have extended the conference to an additional day for the first time ever, providing two days of Workshops (Thursday + Friday) and two days of Sessions (the weekend) to bring together Europe's Roller Derby community in discussion and development.</p>
<p>Whilst EROC has always existed to help build the European community, this year has a particular focus on "Inclusivity", with several sessions and workshops specifically covering aspects of that area. (Those that do not explicitly cover the topic will still interact with it.)</p>
<p>And there will be a lot of sessions and workshops to cover: </p>
<p><strong>8 workshops</strong> (longer, more interactive topics) of which the titles and conveners of 6 have been released:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bout preparation: Footage Analysis, Data and Statistics (Michael Watson)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Retention &amp; Growth - your league, our sport (Crazylegs)</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Breaking down walls - how to work with conflict management (Maurine Filip)</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>20 sessions</strong> (shorter, more directed topics) of which the titles of 9 have been released:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Group Dynamics and Conflict Management (Pernilla Hellan and Lisa Plüschke)</span></p>
</li>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just another brick in the wall? What we need to know about the individual to create a good fit (Maurine Filip)</span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first WFTDA Continental Cup Feedback Experience and best Practices (Birmingham Blitz Dames)</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other unconfirmed topics previously mentioned as appearing include (unless we've missed a few covered above):</p>
<ul>
<li>Whipping your finances into inclusive shape</li>
<li>Low level harassment, aggression, consent, bystanders behaviour</li>
<li>Officiating crew selection process. Sexism and discrimination</li>
<li>Open divisions and all-gender roller derby</li>
<li>Long lasting officiating</li>
</ul>
<p>However, that's still not all, as in addition, special sessions will be held, including a Round Table meeting with NGBs / National Teams and Governing Bodies, A League Fair (including space to sell merch and advertise your league), a 2 day WFTDA Officiating Clinic (weekend)...</p>
<p>...and the requisite on-skates events, including the "EROC All-Stars Scrimmage" on Saturday afternoon/evening, and Chicks in Bowls Berlin beginners' bowls and ramps sessions on Sunday. </p>
<p>As part of the inclusive focus, <strong>Group Discounts</strong> for multiple-tickets are available for consortia of smaller leagues banding together to share costs (meaning that, for example, if you and three other leagues can each only afford to send a single delegate each, you can pay together for 4, and get the same benefits as a single league sending 4 delegates); <em>if</em> all of those leagues are less than 3 years old, have less than 20 members, and are EROC first timers. If your league does not qualify, there are also a <strong>limited number of "Soliprice" (free, host-subsidised)</strong> tickets available, to delegates with a strong case for why inclusion is particularly important to them (and/or how they will bring EROC experience back to their league).</p>
<p>We would <em>especially</em> encourage leagues from newer areas to send a delegate, if they are able: EROC is only as good as the breadth of experience and viewpoints at it, and some of the most valuable opinions are from some of the newest places with derby.</p>
<p>Registration is available via the following link: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUDoNk7cHaAqDsFIa1vjdCeHBwPjnlVjl-bvRRLhYz3Im_tg/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUDoNk7cHaAqDsFIa1vjdCeHBwPjnlVjl-bvRRLhYz3Im_tg/viewform</a> with Early Bird discounts lasting until the end of the year.</p>
<p>with the additional on-skates activities available with an additional submission here:  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLPe5crURLG9pbhqL3bLoR1xvPRzhshloOmRXTS-ZaVVHOiw/viewform?fbclid=IwAR039VtJfOwx3aQs2xrbQXlF6DbtTbJekb4uePbsULouqX1iG2MreXW9l04" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLPe5crURLG9pbhqL3bLoR1xvPRzhshloOmRXTS-ZaVVHOiw/viewform</a></p>

<span style="font-weight:400;">From almost its inception, Roller Derby has been a fertile ground for "exhibition" teams built around a common experience, from the light-hearted ("Tall and gangly skaters") through the more heartfelt ("surviving a serious injury", "possessing a hidden or invisible illness"). National Teams are themselves built on the same concept: an expression of a common aspect of identity, drawn from a sense of belonging to or of a particular geographical region, culture or ethnicity.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A positive effect of all such teams is that they can give visibility to the concerns and experiences of the community they represent; this can be, and commonly is, the founding aim of such a team. This is certainly the case for the newest such project: the Jewish Roller Derby team, which launched only a few weeks ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We talked to Jewish Roller Derby's founders, Tiggz and Jodi Bon Jodi, both from Rose City Rollers, about their aims for the team, and how you can be involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Tiggz was drawn to form the team partly from her experience within another team drawn from shared history: the 2018 Team Russia Roller Derby. Whilst she enjoyed her time in a National Team and at the World Cup, she was conscious that she didn’t experience the same level of shared-history as the rest of the team did with each other. As the only team member qualifying via a relative with Russian-Jewish heritage, Tiggz was drawn to think about the importance of that other aspect of her culture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This experience was, perhaps, emphasised by living and working in Portland, itself a city with a very small Jewish population (as Jodi noted to us, “if I played for Gotham, maybe I’d not have felt the same need to make a team to represent Jewish people”, given New York’s ownership of the largest Jewish community outside Israel).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But, more than that, it was also the feeling that this was a time when Jewishness needed more voices to counter rising bigotry which drove the pairs’ final decision to make the team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It would take considerable ignorance of history to not be aware of the long-standing spectre of anti-Semitism across the world. Whilst many vocal proponents of this insidious bigotry became quieter in the later half of the 20th century, over the last few decades (and especially the last few years), anti-Semitic speech and conspiracy theories have once again become a dangerous thread in politics, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and elsewhere. Only a few days ago, for example, a </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2018/11/europe/antisemitism-poll-2018-intl/"><span style="font-weight:400;">CNN International poll</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> reported that around a quarter of Europeans polled believed that "Jews have too much influence in business and finance" and "have too much influence in conflict and wars worldwide", and similar figures are reported from the USA. Coupled with dog-whistle attacks from powerful world leaders, and an alarming increase in anti-Semitism motivated murders and assaults worldwide, it's an increasingly dangerous and difficult time to be Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">One way in which we can counter bigotry is to educate and shine a light on those groups discriminated against; bigotry stems from ignorance, and merely being more visible can help to fight fear and intolerance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The word and concept of "Jewishness" incorporates, inherently, a number of interrelated-yet-distinct qualities - belief in (and or practice of) a particular religion, participation in a particular culture, possession of a particular ethnicity or lineage - which any particular Jewish person may participate in all aspects of, or only some or one. (Indeed, there are multiple ethnic divisions within the overall “Jewish ethnicity”, with distinct traditions and languages.) As such, Tiggz and JBJ consider the question of "eligibility" of applicants to be one that should be settled by the applicant themselves, not imposed by a strict definition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">"I'd say to someone wanting to know if they can apply: ask yourself, 'what would it mean to you to be part of a Jewish Roller Derby team?', and decide based on that", says Tiggz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In fact, the founders are excited to see what a spectrum of Jewishness sign up for the project: from people of the Ashkenazi heritage who form the basis for much of Europe’s idea of “Jewish”, through Sephardim, Mizrahim, Maghrebhim and others; and to take opportunities to educate both each other and the Roller Derby community about their diversity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The first "competitive aim" for the Jewish Roller Derby project is to field a WFTDA-gender-policy team at the next Rollercon, against an opponent to be decided. After that, the founders have no concrete plans, although there's always more teams that can be challenged; from National teams to others attached to important campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">More importantly, of course, the Jewish Roller Derby project aims to, whatever bouts it participates in, provide both a space in which Jewish skaters can find community with one-another, and a space and platform for educating and advocating for the Jewish community, at a time when it is needed once again. </span></p>
