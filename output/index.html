<p>With the third WFTDA official rating and ranking of the season (<strong><a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-march-31-2019/">https://wftda.com/rankings-march-31-2019/</a></strong>), we're keeping to our promise to update our "Road to Playoffs series".</p>

<p>Speedy Convalesce, Head NSO of Mannheim's Delta Quads, as well as many other things, is here to help us better visualise what's likely to happen at Playoff selection. This ongoing series reports the ratings and rankings of the top 100 WFTDA teams, calculated as <em>if we were at June 30th 2019</em> [the ranking which will be used to decide Qualifications and seedings into both WFTDA Playoffs, and the Continental Cups].
Whilst we can't predict the future, this will give the best guess of what teams need to do to qualify, based on what they've already done.</p>
<p>As well as attaining a minimum ranking, teams also need to play at least 4 bouts within the eligibility period (December 2018 to June 2019), and we'll be tracking their progress on this measure, too.</p>
<p>The list, updated for this month: (# is number of bouts contributing to the ranking, whilst #El is the number of bouts contributing to their eligibility for playoffs). We'll colour teams to indicate when they've played their minimum number of games for eligibility, but as yet, it's too early for anyone to have met this. We've eliminated any teams which have played less than 2 games since July 2018 here. Teams which have shifted rating (or entered the chart for the first time) since the last article are in <strong><em>BOLD ITALICS</em></strong>.</p>

<p>[We plan to update this list each time WFTDA release a rating and ranking until Playoffs selections] </p>
<p>As you can see, the re-weighting isn't just a technical thing, it produces real effects, visible at the very top of the table. We also have less movement than in the full WFTDA calculation, as some teams move due to the weightings of their bout changing from month to month - whilst our weightings are constant (and relative to the final qualification rating).</p>
<p>With the increased number of games as the season starts to get more busy, there's more movers in the chart this month, however. There's still not much in the Top 28, as those teams mostly have games later in the season, so we don't expect too many surprises for a while.</p>

        <div>
<p>Last year, we brought you an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/06/05/derby-without-borders-an-interview-with-founder-mae-dae/">interview</a> with Mae Dae, to talk about their fantastic project, <a class="reference external" href="http://derbywithoutborders.org/">Derby Without Borders</a>. Since then, less than a year later, the project has gone from strength to strength, helping more leagues in more countries across the world, in more ways. With so much happening, it is past time to write an update on events.</p>
<p>Derby Without Borders was founded in 2017, as a project initially intended to help leagues in places where it was cost-prohibitive to get kit and other basic resources (sometimes because roller skating just wasnât a thing in that country, often also because the cost of items was just much higher than the average wage allowed). The idea was, and still is, that donor leagues or individuals could donate âlightly usedâ or even new, kit to DwB, and the project would distribute items to leagues in need worldwide.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="All the places Derby without Borders has provided help to teams, so far. (Black: kit donations achieved, Blue: âstart upâ support, Green: advice and translation, Yellow: coaching bootcamps (and other additional support), Red: pending kit donation.)" src="images/2019/04/DwB2019.png"><p class="caption">All the places Derby without Borders has provided help to teams, so far. (Black: kit donations achieved, Blue: âstart upâ support, Green: advice and translation, Yellow: coaching bootcamps (and other additional support), Red: pending kit donation.)</p>
</div>
<p>When we talked to Mae back in 2018, DwB had already successfully helped Sailor City Rollers (Buenos Aires, Argentina), Golden City Roller Derby (Johannesburg, South Africa) and the Cairollers (Cairo, Egypt) with donation packs. Theyâve also collected for Roller Derby Beirut (Beirut, Lebanon) (in collaboration with Quad Skate Shop), but have had difficulties getting the kit into Lebanon. Since then, theyâve also been able to support Bangkok Roller Derby (Bangkok, Thailand), Toxic Lima Roller Derby (Lima, Peru), Kyoto Roller Derby (Kyoto, Japan), and Roller Derby Beijing (Beijing, China)â¦</p>
<p>â¦but Derby without Borders have also been extending their goals in order to help Roller Derby in other ways.</p>
<p>Firstly, DwB is no longer just Mae Dae: since the last time we spoke, DwB has recruited a second body in the UK, in the form of Rosie Peacock (who has also set up a third donation collection point in the UK). Theyâve been providing much needed support, Mae admitting âRosie has been absolutely pivotal and an amazing addition to the team - I donât think DwB would have gotten this far without their commitment to the projectâ.
The project has also grown an Advisory Board, positioned to steer the project in the right directions. In recruiting for the board, Mae tells us that they âreached out specifically to have Skaters of Colour on the board: theyâre on the board to help steer the project in the direction it wants to be heading, which means engaging with intersectional, inclusionary and anti-oppressive practices.â</p>
<p>Rosie and Mae were both representing the cause at this yearâs European Rollerderby Organisational Conference (EROC 2019) in Berlin with a stall, and a session on âRemoving barriers to accessibility in roller derbyâ.</p>
<blockquote>
âIt was great to be able to talk with the theme of diversity and inclusivity, and how it relates to DwB, because it really is at the foundation of all of the work that weâre doing - this idea that we need to take down barriers to access in order to make this a more inclusive sport,â</blockquote>
<p>said Mae. In addition, every time DwB has a stall somewhere, more people learn about the project, and offer to support it. At EROC, one of the attending leagues offered to host a collection at their next bout, and to raise funds for the project.
That said, DwB and EROC in some senses were looking in different directions whilst supporting the same ethos. EROC is, intentionally, focused on improving Roller Derby within Europe; whilst Derby without Borders is inherently about looking outside, and working on how to support Roller Derby in other places, building in inclusivity and adapting culture to support other regions from the start.</p>

</div>
<p>In that spirit, then, EROC was also the last event that Mae attended before leaving Europe themself. With Rosie positioned in the UK, Mae has courageously moved to Bangkok, Thailand, allowing them to be physically closer to one big region that would benefit significantly from DwBâs support â South East Asia.</p>
<blockquote>
âMoving to Bangkok to help develop SE Asian roller derby has definitely been huge, and really pivotal.â Mae told us,  âIâm really understanding the needs of the region a lot better than I did before - and just how different the scale of roller derby is in all of Asia!â</blockquote>
<p>Since being closer to the action, theyâve launched an initiative to provide âconsultationâ services to newer leagues, giving them support and advice from the ground up (not just on how to start up a league, but also on developing local cultural competency). The first beneficiary of this is the first ever Roller Derby team in Bali: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/hotlavarollers/">Hot Lava Rollers</a>!</p>
<p>As with many of DwBâs new initiatives, this started with a conversation, as Mae relates.</p>
<blockquote>
âSomeone who used to skate with Crime [City Rollers] - Glitter Punch - reached out to me; sheâd heard about the project, from Hanna P, and she said âI live in Bali now, and Iâm so sad that thereâs no Roller Derby. I really kinda want to make a team, and I was wondering if you could help meââ.</blockquote>
<p>At present, Hot Lava Rollers are just two people, and one set of kit (Glitterâs), and the team is just starting to recruit and look for spaces and other resources. Meanwhile, Mae is actively providing mentorship, on a regular basis.</p>
<blockquote>
âIâm trying to get them all the other resources that they would need, so helping them develop everything from bylaws, policies, through to making a logo, getting them social media, justâ¦ everything.â
âWeâre trying to focus on consistent communication - we talk once a week, even if itâs just a 20 minute check-in. I think also it will be a learning experience in how to help support someone in starting a league without being there - Iâm in Bangkok and itâs not far, only an hourâs time difference - but still, not being physically there to put in the work in the same way that I would / am with Bangkok [is a challenge].â</blockquote>
<p>Whilst advice and support is very important, when it comes to developing Derby-specific skills, thereâs nothing better than a good coach. So, DwB has also been using its connections to organise specific Coaching Bootcamps in those regions involved.</p>
<p>On the 27th April, DwB and Bangkok Roller Derby are co-hosting a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2104905746467908/">bootcamp</a> run by Canberra Roller Derby League (and Team Korea)âs ShortStop; on the 12 October, Atlanta Rollergirls (and Team USA)âs Baller Shot Caller will be running a DwB <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/781786125525096/">organised bootcamp</a> in Bali! A future Bootcamp is also planned for Cairo (to be hosted by the Cairollers, with Zipblock and Freight Train), but dates and funding are still in progress on this.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Being able to run a bootcamp in Bali, in particular, came as a pleasant surprise even to Mae themself.</p>
<blockquote>
âWhen Baller [Shot Caller] had reached out to me to ask what she could help the project with, I said, âwell, hereâs all the places I could use help with coachingâ, and I let her pick.</blockquote>
<!--  -->
<blockquote>
And she said, âIf I have to choose one, I would say Bali. It seems more secluded, and they probably have less resourcesâ!</blockquote>
<!--  -->
<blockquote>
âI said, âitâs just two people - thereâs the potential you could be teaching 5 people minimum skillsâ.
Baller was completely okay with that, as the gain in awareness, and value in increased representation was worth it. We did choose a date later in the year to give time for recruitment, though.â</blockquote>
<p>Having already organised their first DwB bootcamp with Hong Kong Roller Derby (coached by Rosie Peacock and Optimus Grime of Glasgow Menâs Roller Derby), Mae is confident, however, that both bootcamps will have significant regional attendance.</p>
<blockquote>
âThe fact that we had 3 girls from the UAE travel all the way to HK just so they could attend a bootcamp and play a game , just goes to show you how isolated people are - but also how hungry they are for it. What Iâm discovering about SE Asian roller derby, and Middle Eastern roller derby. is that when these things happen people will come from across the region to attend and come together.â</blockquote>
<p>Before Bali, though, the bootcamp in Bangkok will also be significant for another reason, being the first time that Bangkok Roller Derby will field a full team to compete. The bootcamp will see two games - the usual Pan-Asian Spring Rollers v Pan-Asian Spring Rollers setup, followed by the history-making Bangkok versus Hong Kong bout!</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Mae has also been active in providing resources and accessibility in other ways: at present, Roller Derby resources are overwhelmingly available in English (with Spanish probably the next largest). Whilst the WFTDA rules have a translation to the second most widely read language in the world (Chinese), thereâs almost no availability in Hindi (the 3rd) and Arabic (the 6th â and 3rd most read as a second language) â and the most spoken Slavic language in the world, Russian, has a similar lack of support.</p>
<p>DwB has projects underway to translate resources into under-represented languages to increase accessibility â in the case of Arabic, with the support of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/UAERollerDerby/">UAE Roller Derby All-Stars</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cairollers.com/">Cairollers</a>. (Weâll be catching up with the Cairollers shortly in another article, as they also have exciting news.) Russian translations of the Short Track Roller Derby ruleset have already been produced, thanks to efforts from the White Night Furies, and Abu Dhabi Roller Derbyâs Spinky, as well!</p>
<p>In the future, Mae dreams of having a âdatabase of different resources for leagues, in all the languages; so if a league needs a framework for a code of conduct in Spanish, they can just go to the database and find something to base it onâ. Thatâs for the future, however: the current effort is focused on getting basic rules and coaching resources translated.</p>
<p>As well as translation, another issue, especially for countries with more filtered access to the Internet, can simply be access to resources at all. In China, for example, common hosts for Roller Derby resources like YouTube, Google Drive, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, Medium and WordPress are all either permanently or irregularly blocked. Derby Without Borders is actively working with the Chinese Roller Derby community to provide access to the resources that the community needs, using hosts which are acceptable to the Chinese government.</p>
<p>And Derby without Borders continues to pursue its original goal of providing kit for skaters, as well. One of the first things that Mae noticed at Bangkok was that many of the skaters had inflexible, heavy mouthguards designed for Muay Thai. As theytold us, this isnât really ideal:</p>
<blockquote>
âyou canât really speak when youâre wearing them, and can barely breathe in them. So I just emailed SISU and said âhey, can you like just give us 20 mouthguardsâ and they were like âyeah, sure, and just shipped them overâ.â</blockquote>
<p>As well as SISU, other derby-related businesses - Steaks, Riedell, and Bont - have shown interest in supporting the project, especially as it has gained more visibility in the community. (Bont-sponsored skater Shortshop has managed to provide a set of wheels as a âprizeâ at her bootcamp in Bangkok, for example.)</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Bangkok Roller Derby with SISU donated mouthguards, thanks to DwB [Image: Derby without Borders]" src="images/2019/04/Bangkok-SISU.jpg"><p class="caption">Bangkok Roller Derby with SISU donated mouthguards, thanks to DwB [Image: Derby without Borders]</p>
</div>
<p>All of this additional activity, however, is only sustainable if Derby without Borders continues to grow itself. Mae is currently working towards a new model for the organisation: regional âchaptersâ which can help to organise and manage the effort which DwB brings. (The Asia chapter will almost certainly be the first to be established, with recruitment happening now.)
The project is already growing fast enough to need this right now.</p>
<blockquote>
âOne thing that Iâm learning is understanding my own bandwidth and capability - how much I can do as one person.â Mae told us âParticularly, at this point, Iâm doing all of this work because I want to do it - thereâs no funding. Understanding my own bandwidth has been important because Iâve had two people reach out to me who were interested in doing the same thing in India, and whilst I absolutely want to help someone start a league in India, I think I might need to focus on one at a time, for now. I think with them Iâm going to have to take a step back.â</blockquote>
<p>Team India Roller Derby have since agreed to help support these potential seeds of Roller Derby, in collaboration with DwB, but the project still needs more people - and leagues - to join in.</p>
<p>One Derby without Borders initiative which has been active for the start is the idea of âSibling Leaguesâ: an opportunity for established leagues to pair up with specific leagues elsewhere in the world to offer them support. This support could be in terms of equipment donations, as the scheme was originally formulated with Texas collecting kit to donate directly to the Cairollers. However, as DwB evolves, it could equally be provided as knowledge exchange, guidance, and political and social support.</p>
<blockquote>
âI would love to see that kind of Sibling league relationship develop with more leagues.â Mae told us, âinstead of needing to come through DwB [to give support], it could be more like a mentorship: one league can mentor another league, and develop all their resources between the two of them. Thatâs whatâs going to make it more sustainable in the long run [and] thatâs the point of the project, creating these things for the sake of sustainability.â</blockquote>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Whilst weâve mostly focused on activities in Asia in this update, that should not imply that DwB is not working for other regions as well. Mae told us that they have been in contact with Forajidas Roller Derby, who are currently trying to (re)establish the only league in Ecuador (in Quito, the capital).</p>
<p>Whilst the Forajidas have a GoFundMe ( <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gofundme.com/help-bring-roller-derby-to-ecuador">https://www.gofundme.com/help-bring-roller-derby-to-ecuador</a> ), they also need guidance and support in forming their league. Mae is actively looking for either a Sibling League, or a coach, or both, who can help to support the new team.</p>
<p>And, as well as helping to nurture and advise new and developing leagues, DwB is also working to support Roller Derby in other ways. Derby Without Borders can host crowdfunders for such leagues to allow them to raise funds more easily: at present, theyâre hosting a GoFundMe to support Buenos Airesâ 2Ã4 Roller Derby on their current international travel requirements. (You can donate here: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gofundme.com/2x4-international-tour-2019">https://www.gofundme.com/2x4-international-tour-2019</a> )</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>Derby without Borders is open to assisting any league or team who need their support: regardless of if thatâs in SE Asia where Mae is currently focused, or in Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe or Africa.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you, or your league, or your company, want to support Derby without Borders in any way mentioned in this article (or another way you can think of), we encourage you to join in. Derby without Borders can only get better as it gets bigger - and it can only get bigger with more of the community pitching in to support it.</p>
<p>You can support DwB via their Donation page [ <a class="reference external" href="https://derbywithoutborders.org/donate">https://derbywithoutborders.org/donate</a> ] and by buying their merch (which also lets you raise awareness of the project by wearing it everywhere) [ <a class="reference external" href="https://derbywithoutborders.org/merchandise">https://derbywithoutborders.org/merchandise</a> ].

<p>Whilst we often talk about Roller Derby in North America, and Europe and Australasia, and somewhat less about Latin America (at least, in English - <em>en espaÃ±ol,</em> a lot is said) we speak much less about Roller Derby in the rest of the World. Part of this is because of a similar tendency to only talk about teams which compete internationally... of which there are much fewer outside of those above regions. This is a self-fulfilling prophecy, of course, since isolated teams, inherently, find it hard to find any local opponents: and they can't find international opponents if people don't talk about them.</p>
<p>The United Arab Emirates has had two Roller Derby leagues: Dubai Roller Derby, and Abu Dhabi Roller Derby, for more than 6 years, the two forming within a few months of each other in late 2012. It's been hard for them to find opponents elsewhere, however, especially given the roster sizes for the two. 
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>So, this year, members of both teams decided to collaborate on a bigger thing: a Emirates-wide Travel Team, <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/UAERollerDerby/">UAE Roller Derby All-Stars</a></strong>, representing the country on the international stage. (Between them, Dubai and Abu Dhabi represent about 2/3s of the population of the UAE, but there are 5 other Emirates which could still develop teams.)
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>We spoke to two of the main agents of this initiative, Mean Curls and Inga Kneeâher, about how this got organised, and what their plans are.
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>As long ago as 2013, Dubai and Abu Dhabi Roller Derby had discussed the possibility of forming a national, potentially WFTDA-sanctioned, joint team. However, with both leagues also organising their individual affairs, it wasn't possible to achieve this until recently: there wasn't enough time, or experience, in the teams to build the bigger plan.</strong>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>In 2018, however, Inga Knee'her became one of the most experienced new members of Dubai Roller Derby - transferring to the team after 10 years of experience in Steel City Roller Derby (at the time WFTDA D 1 team), and Tokyo Roller Derby. As well as spearheading the adoption of Rolla Skate Club's Short Track Roller Derby ruleset to enable Dubai to play more derby in more places, she's also become part of the trio behind the UAE All-Stars.
With Spinky (president of Abu Dhabi Roller Derby) and Mean Curls, the plan has gone from a discussion over ice-cream to reality.
As Inga and Mean Curls tell it: "In less than two months, we [] created the team, organized weekly practices focusing on Short Track coached by Inga, and played our first international game in Hong Kong as part of Pan Asian Spring Rollers (prompting the self-proclaimed name of the âGet Sh*t Done Teamâ :D)."
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>With Dubai and Abu Dhabi also the most populous cities in the UAE (and their eponymous emirates), and fairly closely located, the All-Stars can alternate training between the two easily, helping to build a sense of equal partnership in the national team.
At present, the team is working on helping to develop visibility and interest in Roller Derby - and Roller  skating - in the UAE, where historically there hasn't been much. (At present, all of Dubai and Abu Dhabi's kit comes from abroad via international shipping.)
One aim of this increased visibility is towards developing the skill levels for their member skaters, by providing opportunities for higher level play that would otherwise be inaccessible. 
Inga's contacts with the Pan-Asian Spring Rollers (the Roller Derby collaboration between Beijing, Shanghai, Hong-Kong and Bangkok <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/06/07/east-asian-derbys-new-spring-rollers/">we've covered previously</a></strong>) immediately paid off in this sense. Having played against the Spring Rollers as part of the Women's Roller Derby Japan team at the <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/01/19/the-tomodachi-derby-tournament-the-teams/">Tomodachi Roller Derby tournament</a></strong> in Okinawa (2017), she was hoping for opponents to play Short Track derby with.
As it happens, the timing of the Spring Rollers bout against Hong-Kong was too good to pass up: Mean Curls, Spinky, and Inga were able to make the trip to join Pan Asia v. Hong Kong as members of the Spring Rollers team.
(Their team ended up winning too, 159 to HKRD's 127.)
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>That bout also helped to build even more contacts: Derby Without Borders' founder Mae Dae has recently relocated to Bangkok, and was present as part of the Hong Kong event. We're promised future collaborations with Derby without Borders, supporting their mission in the Middle East and Asia so watch this space! (Mae themself has also been busy since moving to Bangkok, and we'll be catching up with them in a future article.)

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>At home, they're focusing on Short Track Roller Derby as it makes practice much more accessible: not only is it easier in terms of numbers, the smaller space needed (the Short Track track fits inside a standard basketball court) makes it much easier, and cheaper, to find spaces to practice in. 
With the UAE's regulations limiting other opportunities (public events need licenses, for example), having more options in hosting always helps. 
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>However, UAE All-Stars aren't limiting themselves to a single ruleset for future games. Inga and Mean Curls emphasised "we are interested in any and all roller derby opportunities for our skaters. We are lucky to live in a place with direct flights to so many cities, making it relatively easy for us to visit other teams as well as to host events in the future." Â </p>
<p>And, whilst the team has not ruled out applying to join the WFTDA in the future, they're also setting their sites on the most international of competitions. 
"Our ultimate goal is to represent the UAE at the next Roller Derby World Cup," the team told us, adding "Mean Curls is the only current Emirati roller derby skater (that we know of) and will represent us on the Nations Committee".

<p>Speedy Convalesce, Head NSO of Mannheim's Delta Quads, as well as many other things, is here to help us better visualise what's likely to happen at Playoff selection. This ongoing series reports the ratings and rankings of the top 100 WFTDA teams, calculated as <em>if we were at June 30th 2019</em> [the ranking which will be used to decide Qualifications and seedings into both WFTDA Playoffs, and the Continental Cups].
Whilst we can't predict the future, this will give the best guess of what teams need to do to qualify, based on what they've already done.</p>
<p>As well as attaining a minimum ranking, teams also need to play at least 4 bouts within the eligibility period (December 2018 to June 2019), and we'll be tracking their progress on this measure, too.</p>
<p>The list, updated for this month: (# is number of bouts contributing to the ranking, whilst #El is the number of bouts contributing to their eligibility for playoffs). We'll colour teams to indicate when they've played their minimum number of games for eligibility, but as yet, it's too early for anyone to have met this. We've eliminated any teams which have played less than 2 games since July 2018 here. Teams which have shifted rating (or entered the chart for the first time) since the last article are in <strong><em>BOLD ITALICS</em></strong>.</p>

<p>[We plan to update this list each time WFTDA release a rating and ranking until Playoffs selections] </p>
<p>As you can see, the re-weighting isn't just a technical thing, it produces real effects, visible at the very top of the table. We also have less movement than in the full WFTDA calculation, as some teams move due to the weightings of their bout changing from month to month - whilst our weightings are constant (and relative to the final qualification rating).</p>

<p>Since our <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/10/26/short-track-roller-derby-a-first-scottish-test/">first article</a></strong> on <strong><a href="https://rollaskateclub.com/lets-rolla/">Short Track Roller Derby</a></strong>, back in 2018, the new ruleset has continued to spread, in almost all the places in the world where Roller Derby is played.
As such, we thought weâd follow up, just 4 months later, with some of the exciting developments in Short Track worldwide.</p>
<p>Firstly, as readers of <strong><a href="https://whataboutmagazine.com/">What A Bout</a></strong> magazine will already know, Short Track Roller Derby has spread further-and-wider than we could have hoped: to Russia, and Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, already. You should read the full article in WAB <strong><a href="https://whataboutmagazine.com/2019/01/20/what-a-bout-issue-3-winter-2019/">Issue 3</a></strong> for full details, but look out for several Short Track tournaments in Moscow, and other Russian cities later in the year. Dubaiâs interest in Short Track has also led to bigger things which weâll get to later in this article.</p>
<p>Short Track is continuing to enable more teams to play derby, even now.</p>
<p>In Poland, GdaÅskâs <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/551140512034275/">Chrome Sirens</a></strong> are playing their first ever public game, thanks to Short Track rules enabling them to put together two competitive teams (and use more accessible venues). This double-header event will be coming to the city in the middle of next month - March 16th!</p>
<p>In the Americas, Short Track Derby is also taking off: ruleset creators Rolla Skate Club having provided initial impetus with a comprehensive series of trial sessions across Canada and the North-west of the USA. In Latin America, meanwhile, there is interest in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in exploring the ruleset, as it solves several of the challenges of the many teams in the city.</p>

<!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p>In the USA, though, public bouts have already started, with the ruleset enabling teams to play their first games in years!</p>
<p>For <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/IVVRD/">Illinois Valley Vixens Roller Derby</a></strong>, who played their first public bout for 3 years thanks to Short Track back in February, the ruleset has been a revelation. Whilst some venue issues meant that they had to modify the track slightly, the bout was a complete success - despite only using word of mouth and social media for advertising, they managed to fill all the available seating. Speaking for the league, Lemon Squeezer told us : âWe now know that a smaller track definitely does not mean less exciting or intense, quite the opposite! I can't remember a time I have heard a crowd this engaged before and the feedback from spectators was that they are looking forward to the next one and bringing friends. We also had several former skaters come to check it out that are now interested in coming back.â. 
I.M.GROOT added, âThe fact that all players have to both jam and block really takes you out of your comfort zone. It pushes you to use all the skills you have learned, not just the ones you prefer. Short Track has the ability to really push skaters to be stronger, better and more adaptable in game play.â</p>
<p>In an even more striking mode, the USA has also brought us the first ever âShort Trackâ league: <strong><a href="https://www.pstrollerderby.com/">Pittsburgh Short Track Roller Derby</a></strong>, founded by a group of skaters who retired from âcompetitiveâ Roller Derby, but still wanted to play a friendlier version of the sport. Their league aim, as expressed on their website and Facebook page, âWe are a group of friends who wanted to create a safe, stress free environment to get together and skate. Community over competition.â encapsulates the entire point of Short Track as a ruleset and community. (You can find out more about them on social media and their website.)</p>
<p>Further in the future, thereâs also exciting news of potentially the first ever international Short Track Roller Derby Tournament. Â The newly created <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/UAERollerDerby/">UAE All-Stars</a></strong>, the United Arab Emiratesâ official travel team, are exploding onto the scene, and one of their first public plans is to play Short Track Derby! Formed of skaters from <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DubaiRollerDerby/">Dubai Roller Derby</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ADRollerDerby/">Abu Dhabi Roller Derby</a></strong>, the team plan to play all kinds of Derby, but Short Track is definitely a solid component of their goals. [We have more about UAE All-Stars themselves in another new article here, which weâre going to publish soon - and their first ever public game <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/495068457564329/">will be this weekend</a></strong>, 2nd March, in Hong Kong, as part of the Pan-Asian Spring Rollers].</p>

<p>Thanks to the support of <strong><a href="http://www.gogogent.be/en/home-default/">GO-GO Gent Roller Derby</a></strong>, who had been investigating hosting an experimental Short Track clinic for several months, UAE All-Stars will be travelling to Belgium on the 1st and 2nd of June. The first day will be a Short Track Roller Derby training workshop, allowing the experienced skaters from Dubaiâs testing of the rules (and potentially other skaters whoâve tried Short Track from the rest of Europe) to explain and demonstrate the potential of the ruleset to attendees. Â 
The second day will be a tournament event: the structure of which is still under development. Teams are welcome to participate from across Europe, and we know that thereâs been interest from several regions already.</p>
<p>Even further in the future, thereâs the possibility of Short Track bootcamps in other parts of Europe, including the UK, and other plans afoot about which we canât speak at this time. Stay tuned for further updates as they occur!</p>

<p>Previously on this blog, we've written about Waterford ViQueens' innovative use of the PivotStar rules to hold a fast, efficient and <strong>fun</strong> Roller Derby tournament in the south of Ireland: <strong><a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/05/21/viqueens-victorious-valhalla-a-test-for-pivotstar-rules/">LINK</a></strong>.
After the success of the initial tournament, where 6 teams from across Ireland (and also a single team from France) competed in a faster-paced event, Waterford are doing it again.</p>
<!-- wp:image {"id":27911,"align":"center"} -->

<p><img alt="Waterford ViQueens Logo" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/fb/waterfordviqueens.png" title="Waterford ViQueens Logo"><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/477884896068750/">Victory or Vahalla #2</a></strong> will be a <strong>WFTDA-gender policy</strong> tournament held in Waterford on the <strong>27th April</strong>, aimed at teams from around <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings/women/women_europe">FTS Women's Europe</a></strong>"&gt; rating <strong>400</strong> to <strong>500</strong>. </p>
<p>This tournament will be played under <strong>PivotStar</strong> rules, a variant ruleset developed to allow efficient production of tournaments with less load on officials. This shouldn't put anyone off - the main things that change are: <strong>skaters score 1 point per pass</strong> (not 1 per skater), there are <strong>no runbacks</strong> (track cuts and returns are relative to where you left the track, not relative position of skaters), and games are <strong>20 minutes long</strong> with no timeouts. 
This makes for a fun tournament event, with slightly faster play and different tactics than a WFTDA-standard bout.</p>
<p>This will be the first of several planned "non-standard rules" tournaments in Europe this year (there's at least two in Russia coming up, as well as one or two currently in planning), so we advise people to get in on the fun and not miss out.</p>
<p>Waterford is accessible for international travellers from the airports at Cork Shannon and Dublin, as well from the ferry terminal at Rosslare (for people travelling from Wales or France).</p>

<p>It's a new season for WFTDA competition, and with it we've had the first new official WFTDA rating for the season ( <strong><a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-january-31-2019/">https://wftda.com/rankings-january-31-2019/</a></strong>)
Throughout the year, however, those ratings and rankings will change - not just as the teams play more games, but also because the weighting of their past games will alter. Games will "age out" of the rating if they become more than 1 year old; and games which become more than 6 months old will count only 50% as much.</p>

<p>Speedy Convalesce, Head NSO of Mannheim's Delta Quads, as well as many other things, is here to help us better visualise what's likely to happen at Playoff selection, however. This ongoing series will report the ratings and rankings of the top 100 WFTDA teams, calculated as <strong>if we were at June 30th 2019</strong> [the ranking which will be used to decide Qualifications and seedings into both WFTDA Playoffs, and the Continental Cups].
Whilst we can't predict the future, this will give the best guess of what teams need to do to qualify, based on what they've already done.</p>
<p>As well as attaining a minimum ranking, teams also need to play at least 4 bouts within the eligibility period (December 2018 to June 2019), and we'll be tracking their progress on this measure, too.</p>
<p>The list: (# is number of bouts contributing to the ranking, whilst #El is the number of bouts contributing to their eligibility for playoffs). We'll colour teams to indicate when they've played their minimum number of games for eligibility, but as yet, it's too early for anyone to have met this. We've eliminated any teams which have played less than 2 games since July 2018 here.</p>

<!-- /wp:table --><p>[We plan to update this list each time WFTDA release a rating and ranking until Playoffs selections] </p>
<p>As you can see, the re-weighting isn't just a technical thing, it produces real effects, visible at the very top of the table. For now, the focus on "more recent games" helps to push Rose above Victorian in our rating here; but these closely matched teams are likely to jostle a lot as the year progresses.</p>

<hr>
<p>With the growth of Roller Derby worldwide, there has also come increasing regional organisation. Since 2010, and especially since the first Roller Derby World Cup in 2011 focussed thoughts on National structures, a number of nations, and nation-like entities, have begun organising various "National Tournaments" within themselves. At SRD, we consider these to be as important as any other large scale tournament - such as WFTDA or MRDA events - especially as they can also be more inclusive than such series due to reduced travel costs and membership requirements.</p>
<p>As such, we'd like to highlight the winners of each such tournament series we're aware of in 2018 - and briefly cover the tournaments themselves. As a historical resource, we also host a summary of all of the winners of the tournaments (and some references for them) here:Â <a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/NationalTournaments.html">National Tournaments (2010-)</a>
</p>
<h5>We'll start with the two largest such events (it's hard to judge which is larger, as they have exchanged places on various metrics year to year):</h5>
<hr>
<h4>UK&amp;Ireland ("<a href="https://www.britishchamps.com/">British Championships</a>")</h4>

<p>British Champs has been running since 2015, and has made various changes to its structure over the years (the most recent to improve inclusion and accessibility). It is structured as a multi-tiered divisional system, with each "skill level" tier divided into one or more geographical "divisions"; teams promote/relegate between tiers between seasons. Since 2016, Champs has officially run parallel tournaments for WFTDA- and MRDA- conforming teams, and has also allowed competition from non-A teams.</p>
<p>In 2018, the WFTDA-side tournament winners, topping Tier 1 convincingly were: <strong>Central City Roller Derby (Birmingham), </strong>not only winning every game against their opponents, but also achieving a significantly higher points difference than the second spot team, Liverpool.
2018 has been a good year for Birmingham teams, as the city's other team, Birmingham Blitz Dames, also hosted the first ever WFTDA Continental Cup in Europe later in the season.<strong></strong></p>
<p>The MRDA-side tournamentÂ  was topped extremely impressively by <strong>New Wheeled Order (Manchester M)</strong>, also delivering a huge points-difference advantage over second place Tyne and Fear. New Wheeled Order have had a very good few years, and we expect even more from them in 2019.
</p>
<h4>France ("Championnat de France Roller Derby")</h4>
The French National tournament series is, like the similarly sized British Champs, organised into Tiers by strength, and also loosely divided into geographical regions. (Unlike British Champs, there is competition across regions within a tier; also unlike BC, the Championnat is run directly as part of the French NGB, the FFRS.) The Championnat de France has <em>Feminin</em>- and <em>Masculin</em>- parallel tournaments; some leagues submit teams to the tournament which differ from their Travel teams, and the relaxed structure of the tournament also allows for "combined" team submissions from cooperating leagues. Unusually, compared to many of the other tournaments listed here, the French Championnat is fitted to the French sporting season (roughly following the European school year), and so starts in the previous winter, and finishes in the early summer each year.
<p>Repeating their victory in 2017, <strong>Nothing Toulouse (Roller Derby Toulouse)</strong> retained the French Championship this year. They remain one of the few non-WFTDA member leagues to hold a Championship position in their home country.</p>
<p>Undefeated champions since the Championnat started in 2016, <strong>Quad Guards (Toulouse M)</strong> continued their streak for another year in 2018.</p>
<hr>
<h5>Whilst the French and British tournaments are the largest, they are not the longest running National tournaments. Next, we're going to cover the longest running tournaments in modern Derby, the four which started in 2012:</h5>

<h4>Sweden (Swedish Roller Derby Seriespel)</h4>

<p>The Swedish National Tournament,Â  . Like larger tournaments, the Series is split into tiers ("serien"), with the Eliteserien being the top tier. More recently, Elite tier teams have been allowed to differ from the Travel teams for their league. There is only a WFTDA-gender tournament in Sweden, to date.</p>
<p>In 2018, <strong>Crime City Rollers (MalmÃ¶)</strong> retained their Championship title for the third year running, placing them one more victory behind Stockholm's streak of 4 wins (from 2012 to 2015).
</p>
<h4>Finland (Suomi Cup)</h4>
Finland's National Tournament is structured rather like the Swedish version, including the tendency of Elite tier leagues to submit non-Travel team rosters to the tournament. For the first time, in 2019 the Suomi Cup will be open to non-Finnish teams (making it an interesting extension of "National"), as St Petersburg Roller Derby A, the White Night Furies, compete.
<p>For the first time in 2018, <strong>Oulu Roller Derby</strong> achieved the Championship title, breaking a run of alternating wins by Helsinki and Kallio over the previous 6 years.</p>
<p>[Northern Finland also holds its own tournament - the Pohjola Cup - which started the tradition of welcoming non-Finnish participants in previous years via St Petersburg. So, in some ways, it sets the trend for its higher-profile southern relative.]
</p>
<h4>Mexico (Torneo Nacional de Roller Derby)</h4>
Mexico's National Tournament series has been organised by their national governing body, the AsociaciÃ³n Mexicana de Roller Derby, since it began in 2012. We've covered the leadup to the current season on the blog previously here: <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/07/18/mexican-national-championships-2018/">Mexican National Tournament article</a>. The series consists of a series of playoffs, selected by rating/ranking in the Mexican league tables (which work using the WFTDA rating scheme), with two divisions. As with many other nations, there are "varonil" and "femenil" parallel tournaments, corresponding to WFTDA- and MRDA- policies.
<p>In 2018, <strong>Mexico City Roller Derby</strong> retained their title for a three-year streak of victories, despite</p>
<p>In the Varonil side of the tournament, <strong>Disorder Roller Derby (Mexico City M)</strong> also began a streak, retaining their title from 2017.
</p>
<h4>Colombia</h4>
Whilst Colombia has run a National Tournament since 2012, the series has had a somewhat more complex past than the others in this category, with a couple of restructurings, and a hiatus from 2015 to 2016. In its current form, the Tournament consists of two parallel series - a multi-fixture tournament for BogotÃ¡'s many leagues (the "Torneo Distrito"), and a separate one for teams in the rest of Colombia (the "Western Region" tournament), with the top teams from both then competing at the Torneo Nacional finals. (<a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/08/01/the-5th-colombian-national-tournament-2018-so-far/">We've written more about the 2018 series here.</a>)
<p>2018's Champions, <strong>BogotÃ¡ Bone Breakers</strong>, also retained the BogotÃ¡ title in 2018, as well as continuing a three win streak in the national series (albeit across that 2 year gap).</p>
<hr>
<h5>Slightly less venerable than the oldest tournaments, but not in the size rank as Britain and France, our next grouping also covers a large geographical area.</h5>

<h4>Brazil (BrasileirÃ£o de Roller Derby)</h4>

<p>Brazil's national Championship, the BrasileirÃ£o, is a single-fixture event at present, which started as least as long ago as 2013 (there's some evidence it started earlier). Due to the distribution of teams in the country, it's semi-invitational, although the highest rated teams in Brazil always attend. (<a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/10/11/the-brasileirao-brazils-national-championships-at-8/">We've written more about the history of the tournament here.</a>)</p>
<p>2018's BrasileirÃ£o winners were <strong>Gray City Rebels (SÃ£o Paulo)</strong>, retaining the title from 2017 (and resisting Ladies of Helltown's attempts to take back the title from 2016).
</p>
<h4>Chile (Torneo X / Torneo X-Men)</h4>
Chile has one of the youngest National Tournaments in Latin America, with the first Torneo X beginning in 2015. Year on year, it has gained more participants, and has had to change structure multiple times to accommodate this, currently using a playoffs and finals structure. For the first time in 2018, B teams have been allowed to compete, enabling Chile's strongest (and only WFTDA-member) league, Metropolitan Roller Derby, to compete with its Bayonetas.
Since 2017, there has also been a MRDA-gender tournament, the Torneo X-Men, run in parallel, and loosely associated with the original WFTDA-gender event.
(<a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/07/26/chilean-national-championships-2018-torneo-x-returns/"><strong>We've covered an intro to this year's Torneo X earlier on the blog.</strong></a>)
<p>For the first time ever, 2018's winners are a B-team: <strong>Bayonetas (Metropolitan B | Santiago)</strong>, taking a fairly commanding win in the final bout.
In the Torneo X-Men, which finished earlier in the year, <strong>Terror S-Quad (Santiago M)</strong> were victorious for a second time in a row.
</p>
<h4>Germany (Bundesliga Roller Derby)</h4>
The German National Tournament, or Bundesliga, formally started in 2015, as a multi-tier tournament run by the German NGB, Roller Derby Deutschland (RDD). In this form, its history has been tracked by Derbyposition.de since the beginning; the structure is much like the much larger French and British tournaments, but without the need for multiple geographical divisions, due to its smaller number of teams. (There were two previous events which might count as "German National Tournaments", in 2010 and 2013, but they are not part of the modern event.)
As with several other National series in nations with very high rated WFTDA-member leagues, those leagues have begun sending "non-Travel teams" to represent them in the tournament.
<p>For the first time in the tournament's history, <strong>Dresden Pioneers</strong> comprehensively won the Bundesliga Division 1 in 2018.
</p>
<h4>Australia (Australian National Tournament &amp; Australian Men's Nationals)</h4>
Unusually, Australia has not had a formally denoted "National Tournament" for WFTDA leagues (although you could claim that the Great Southern Slam counts, given the scope of its attendance). The Australian Men's Roller Derby organisation, on the other hand, has organised an Australian Men's Nationals since 2015, as a single fixture tournament towards the end of the year.
More recently, an unusual "State-teams" style National Tournament has been launched (for the first time in 2018), with WFTDA- and MRDA- gender legs, but we're not sure if this counts as a National tournament in the same sense as the other events in this list.
<p>In 2018, <strong>Victoria Men's Roller Derby</strong> won the Australian Men's Nationals, having lost it for the first time ever in 2017 (to Tasmania!).</p>
<hr>
<h5>For our final grouping, we have another eclectic selection of Nations, all united in having run a National series for 3 years or less.</h5>

<h4>New Zealand (Top 10 Championships)</h4>

<p>New Zealand's "Top 10 Championships" have been running since 2016, although information on the second year of their organisation is a little patchy due to website bitrot. In general, the series is a flat round-robin style event, distributed across the year, with no tiering or geographical structure. As far as we are aware, there's only a WFTDA-gender version of the tournament so far.</p>
<p>In 2018, <strong>Dead End Derby (Christchurch)</strong> won the Top 10 Championships for the first time (ending Wellington's Richter City's streak of 2 years).
</p>
<h4>Spain (Campeonato Nacional de Roller Derby)</h4>
The Spanish National tournament is a single event affair, due to the relatively small number of potential competitors in Spain at present. Organised by the Spanish National Governing body, the single tournament sees the top teams in the country play for victory in a single elimination structure. The event has run since 2016, with an additional MRDA parallel event introduced in 2017.
<p>In 2018, <strong>Roller Derby Madrid</strong> continued their unbroken win streak since the start of the competition.</p>
<p>Similarly, 2018's winners in the other division were <strong>MadRiders (Madrid M)</strong>, also continuing an unbroken win since last year.
</p>
<h4>Austria</h4>
Austria's National tournament only started in 2017; before then, there was effectively only one sufficiently developed team in the country (Vienna Roller Derby), and so no way to hold such an event. Due to the small number of teams, the Austrian National Championship is a single fixture event; and due to the dearth of MRDA teams, it has only a WFTDA leg.
<p>In 2018, <strong>Vienna Roller Derby</strong> retained their title from 2017, although competition within the rest of the teams was strong, Vienna have a significant experience advantage in their country.
</p>
<h4>South Africa (National Derby Fest)</h4>
South Africa have held a National Championship event since 2016, although that first event included "home teams" from some of the leagues involved. As South Africa has very few leagues with travel teams, this event is a single fixture which also focuses on developing the sport within the nation. (<a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/10/31/south-africas-national-derby-fest-2018-three-years-of-festivals/">We've written more about the history of the event here.</a>)
<p>In 2018, Johannesburg's <strong>Golden City Rollers</strong> retained their win streak since the dawn of the tournament.
</p>
<h4>Belgium (Roller Derby Belgium National Tournament)</h4>
Finally, we come to the newest National tournament in our list: Belgium. The Belgian national tournament, organised by rd.BE, the Belgian NGB, ran for the first time this year, as a year-long series of round-robin fixtures within tiers. (Initial tiers were drawn from FTS Europe ratings.) From the start, the rd.BE event has had a WFTDA- and an MRDA- leg.
<p><strong>Antwerp Roller Derby (One Love Roller Dolls)</strong> are the first ever holders of the rd.BE Championship title.</p>
<p>In the MRDA leg, Brussels' <strong>Manneken Beasts</strong> achieved the first ever Championship.</p>
<hr>
<h5>Special mention:</h5>

<h4>Japan (Derby Nights 4x4)</h4>

<p>Whilst it's structure is rather different to every other event in this list, we should note that Japan has also had a Tokyo-series first for the first time in 2018. The Derby Nights 4x4 ("DN4x4") series was a multi-fixture event with "womens" and "mens" legs, open to leagues of all affiliations in Japan. (As such, the women's division included both the World Skate/FIRS affiliated Spiral Cats, and all of the WFTDA-affiliated leagues in the Tokyo metropolitan area, from Tokyo Roller Derby to the independent Kamikaze Badass.) This was a unique ruleset, with, we believe, 4 skaters per competing team, and very short period and jam lengths.</p>
<p>In 2018, <strong>Neon Roller Monsters</strong> (the submitted team from Tokyo Roller Derby) won the women's division.
The new-in-2018 team, <strong>Tokyo Bar Hoppers</strong>, won the men's division (which had only 2 teams this year!).</p>
<p>We're excited to see what happens with this tournament format, and if it expands beyond the Tokyo region to the rest of Japan.</p>

<p>Continuing our series of guest posts, we're keeping topical with a review of Namur Roller Girls' league management web app, TrackKarma by Glasgow Men's Roller Derby's Rosie Peacock.<br><br><strong><a href="https://www.trackkarma.com/">TrackKarma</a></strong> is completely free to use*, although it can only be used as a web application (there is no self-hosting option). The self-reporting on the website says that, at the time of publication, 376 leagues are currently using the service. At present, the service is available in both English and French, and has no user limits.</p>

<!-- /wp:separator --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Trackkarma (TK) is an app (well, a website that runs like an app) developed by Namur Roller Girls.<br>Their launching blurb is as followsâ¦.<br>âEver dreamed of teams charters, training sessions, attendance, league agenda and directory all gathered in one single tool?<br>Here it is: TrackKarma, the application that will change the world (or at least your league).<br>In TrackKarma, members can:</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

<ul>
<li>Manage their player profile and import a cute picture</li>
<li>Check monthly agenda of games and training sessions</li>
<li>Inform of their absence at practice</li>
<li>Communicate with their bench crews</li>
<li>Visualize team charters and game rosters</li>
<li>Register to coach at practice...</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Bench crews can:</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

<ul>
<li>Organize players into teams</li>
<li>Select players for game rosters</li>
<li>Add games and related information to the agenda</li>
<li>Communicate with their players</li>
<li>Check players' attendance...</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Which sounds AMAZING, so Glasgow Menâs Roller Derby (GMRD) decided to give it a whirl.<br><br>Previously GMRD have tried alternatives to Facebook groups such as Slack, but we struggle to get everyone on board with using alternatives as although Facebook is handy for social media, itâs also the devil. [For a review of such options, we recommend <strong><a href="https://medium.com/@shredinger/software-tools-for-nonprofits-f2cc73deea49">this article</a></strong> - Ed]<br><br>We have been trialling TrackKarma for about 3 months now and these are my thoughts:<br>I am a terrible technophobe, and I find TK very easy to use. <br><br>It makes sense and I donât feel stupid using it (yey!). <br><br>It is incredibly useful for keeping record of training sessions, games and attendance; however, like most âextraâ bits of work we ask skaters to do on top of training, some folk are using it really well, and others havenât logged on at all.<br><br>Initially we asked everyone to be responsible for updating and maintaining their own attendance, but this was a bit optimistic on our part and so now we ask coaches to update skatersâ attendance after each session they coach.</p>
