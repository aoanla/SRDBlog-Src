<p>Arguably one of the high points of roller derby in Glasgow was way back in August 2012, when Glasgow Roller Derby hosted their first
tournament event, <em>Chaos on the Clyde</em> (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/884747741612081/">FB</a> , <a class="reference external" href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/17770">FTS</a> , <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120829101350/https://www.glasgowrollerderby.com/bouts-events/bouts-eventschaos2012/">WEB</a> ). (This was also around the time that the National Museum of Roller Derby was getting going, and
so, as well as the international competition, the NMRD stall also helped to develop derby in different senses.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, thanks to the venue used being closed not long after, and other suitable venues being inaccessible, it's been 6 years now until Glasgow Roller Derby have been able to bring back the event.</p>
<img alt="Image of flyer for Chaos on the Clyde 2." src="images/2019/07/Chaos2019flyer.png"><p>But, back it is, with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/854543498244493/https://www.glasgowrollerderby.com/events-calendar/2019/8/17/chaos-on-the-clyde-2">Chaos on the Clyde 2</a> hosted in GRD's regular venue of the ARC in late August this year!</p>

<p>Roller Derby in China, and Asia in general (outside of Japan) has always been a widely dispersed community, with initiatives like the Pan-Asian Spring Rollers helping to tie the region together, and share resources sustainably. However, there've been relatively few big "all-day all-round" bootcamps in the region, and, in particular, little for the officiating side of the sport.</p>
<p>So, it was particularly exciting to hear that <a class="reference external" href="https://beijingrollerderby.weebly.com/">Beijing Roller Derby</a> was hosting a 1-day multi-discipline bootcamp over the Dragon Boat Festival Weekend (8 June) this year. Skaters from all three Chinese-region leagues - Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong - were present, for the all day event.</p>
<img alt="Flyer logo for the Beijing Dragon Bootcamp event." src="images/2019/07/Beijingbootcamplogo.jpg"><p>We talked to a few of the attendees for feedback on the event, which included everything from Skate maintenance and "what is Roller Derby", all the way through drills, communication skills, and a final modified-<a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com/short-track-roller-derby-resources/">Short Track</a> rules scrimmage.</p>

<p>This is another single-update for the entire weekend - but that doesn't mean it's not exciting! We have a lot of derby happening across the world, including a three-day bootcamp in Estonia (covering WFTDA, Roller Derby Sevens and Short Track), and even more variant games in Australia, as South Sea Roller Derby host another Rainbow Lightning tournament (which is a ruleset we'd love to see people try in Europe sometime).</p>
<p>In Scotland, New Town Roller Derby host a Charity LGBT scrimmage, to support West Lothian Pride.</p>
<p>The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the <em>Scottish</em> Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )</p>
<p>In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).</p>
<p>Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).</p>

<p>This weekend (and the week leading to it) is pretty dominated by the world's largest annual Roller Derby event, Rollercon. With people travelling across the world to attend, the schedule elsewhere is a little sparse, but there are still exciting things happening.</p>
<p>We've also included a bonus section in this week's roundup highlighting sessions at Rollercon itself which we think are either interesting, or important, or both.</p>
<p><em>This list was updated on Thursday 18th to include late announced bouts on Sunday in Mexico and Argentina</em></p>
<p>The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the <em>Scottish</em> Roller Derby Blog).

<p>In the last few days, the brackets and confirmed attendees for the WFTDA post-season events - WFTDA Division 1 Playoffs, and the WFTDA Continental Cups - have been announced.
This year continues the trend of increasing "worldwide" participation of teams in the post-season - which also means increasing average costs for the sport!</p>
<p>Whilst we would like to congratulate all the teams on making Playoffs or CC, this article isn't just to celebrate them (even though we made a map to drive home the distribution)!</p>
<p>We thought that providing some hard-ish numbers on costs might be useful, so we did a bit of calculation to feed discussion. More after the break...</p>

<p>This weekend's highlights are back to our 1 update format as this is a little quieter. There's a bunch of exciting "summer" events on, though, which we should highlight up here: in the UK, Eastbourne Extreme takes derby outside and to the coast for a 2 day mixed tournament; in France, Saint-Gratien once again hosts the pan-France Tournament of 6 Regions; and in Bundaberg, Australia, the 2019 SKATE of Emergency continues to raise funds for emergency services.</p>
<p>(We'd also like to highlight the next "Un sol para lxs oficialxs", raising travel funds for Argentinian officials to support Roller Derby across the country; and on a different note ALL-IN's Short Track Experiment event in Leeds, exploring the new ruleset and how it might help to sustain &amp; develop the sport.)</p>
<p><em>This article amended on Tuesday for two late announced fixtures in Spain and Mexico.</em></p>
<p>The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the <em>Scottish</em> Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )</p>
<p>In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).</p>
<p>Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).</p>

<p><em>Last month, Italy's largest Roller Derby tournament, Skate Im Ring (SKIR) held its Golden Edition, as always in Bolzano. Luckily for us, New Town Roller Derby's Hazzard
was attending, and has been good enough to provide us with this guest article!</em></p>
<p>---</p>
<p>On the 22nd and 23rd of June, 8 Italian roller derby teams and a swathe of officials had arrived at Arena Ritten, just outside of Bolzano in the North of Italy. They were to participate in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/423438998225036/">Skate Im Ring (SKIR) Golden Edition</a> [link to Facebook] hosted by the Alp’n Rockets.</p>

</div>
<p>The weekend was the 4th edition of the SKIR and was its biggest edition so far.
The tournament consisted of a day of single-period ranking games and a day of full games. The teams were split into two groups and then seeded to go head to head with their counterparts in the other group.</p>
<p>Meeting with two of the organisers of SKIR, Betty Burp and Billi, we chatted about the previous editions of SKIR.</p>

<p>There's not one, but two national championships decided this weekend, as the finals of the Finnish National Championships and the first ever ARDE Spanish National Championships both fall here.</p>
<p>Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).</p>
