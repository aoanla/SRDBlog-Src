<p>Aspiring artists and daring designers can enjoy a brush with success … by designing a logo for Scotland’s national male roller derby team.</p>
<p>Power of Scotland is challenging people to design a new logo for the team as homegrown preparations continue for the Men’s Roller Derby World Cup in Canada next year.</p>
<p>Scottish skaters from across the UK are dreaming of representing their country in Calgary in 2016 – and they could be proudly sporting your logo design on their uniforms.</p>
<p>Manager Nikki Morris said: “Thanks to all those who have already submitted logos for our competition. Rest assured they are all in contention – with some superb ideas in there.</p>
<p>“However, we have decided to extend the deadline to 31 May to give as many people as possible the chance to come up with a corking design which will be the talk of the roller derby world.
</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">“We are looking for something Scottish themed – unicorns, Nessies, tartan, heritage-related – with a twist.<a href="2015/05/11194398_10155484951575587_5898386249802980145_o.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-4643 alignright" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/05/11194398_10155484951575587_5898386249802980145_o.jpg?w=219" alt="11194398_10155484951575587_5898386249802980145_o" width="293" height="398"></a></p>
“Remember it doesn’t have to be the same as the previous logo – which will be going in the selection anyway.”
<p>Pictured here is the results poster with all the team logos from 2014 to give you an idea of the style being sought and how designs translate onto print roll.</p>
<p>Please be aware the FINAL closing date is 31 May.</p>
<p>Visit www.facebook.com/PowerOfScotland for more information.</p>
<p>• Meanwhile, the second Power of Scotland Try-out takes place in Grangemouth Sports Complex at 1.30pm on May 23.
• After try-outs the selection committee will choose a training squad of 30 skaters, who will train together once a month and scrimmage until October.
• In October the selection committee will come together again to watch a Scotland vs Scotland scrimmage made up of the training squad. Skaters will be marked using the selection criteria along with feedback from the coaches.
• From here the 20-man squad which will go to Calgary will be selected and will go on to train till the World Cup.</p>

<p style="text-align:right;">A team of inspirational women are helping to cement Glasgow’s sporting legacy in the wake of the Commonwealth Games.</p>
Glasgow Roller Derby are currently making waves in the top tier of the British Roller Derby Championships.
<p>The sensational skaters from the Clyde-side are lighting up the UK Roller Derby Association Premier League – ensuring the sporting feelgood factor from last year’s Games continues.<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4565 alignright" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/02/grd.jpg?w=300" alt="grd" width="300" height="109"></p>
<p>So far Glasgow Roller Derby (GRD) have convincingly beaten Central City RollerGirls from Birmingham and Rainy City Roller Girls from Oldham.</p>
<p>On May 30 and 31, GRD will host two days of British Roller Derby Champs action in Glasgow’s ARC sportscentre (noon-6pm).</p>
<p>It’s going to be a fantastic double-derby spectacular with Glasgow taking on Middlesbrough Milk Rollers. Also in action will be Auld Reekie Roller Girls from Edinburgh, Tiger Bay Brawlers from Cardiff, Central City RollerGirls and Rainy City Roller Girls.</p>
<p>Before that, on May 2 in Edinburgh, Glasgow will be taking on the Tiger Bay Brawlers and Auld Reekie Roller Derby.</p>
<p>It’s all building up to be a magnificent May for GRD and sport in Scotland.</p>
<p>The British Roller Derby Championships is Europe’s largest inter-league Women’s Flat Track Roller Derby Tournament.
</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="2015/04/1958232_818634904872056_8852349267584931611_n.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-4635 alignleft" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/04/1958232_818634904872056_8852349267584931611_n.jpg?w=300" alt="1958232_818634904872056_8852349267584931611_n" width="300" height="111"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A total of 72 women’s leagues from Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland are divided into four tiers for double-header bout days spanning the year, with play-offs to find who will be British Roller Derby Champions for 2015.</p>
GRD are currently leading the top tier and everyone within the league is working hard to ensure the good form continues.
<p>A spokeswoman said: “We are delighted to be able to continue the wonderful atmosphere that surrounded the city and its people during the Games and in the aftermath.</p>
<p>“We have some of the best derby teams in the UK coming to Glasgow – giving people the chance to see world-class roller derby right on their doorstep. We can’t wait to welcome the top tier teams to our city and show just why we think we have the best fans in the business.</p>
<p>“All of the skaters involved are top quality so we’re delighted to have won our first two games and to have notched up such a healthy points difference.</p>
<p>“We’re taking nothing for granted though – May is going to push our A-team to the very limit – testing all our skills, strategy, endurance, guile and strength.</p>
<p>“We're hoping for another sell-out when the action comes to Glasgow - showing the sensational support for roller derby north of the border.</p>
<p>"Fasten your seatbelts, folks, it’s going to be an edge-of-your-seat two days of derby.”</p>
<p>She added: “We also hope as many fans as possible can make the trip to Edinburgh to roar us on in the Capital in two thrilling contests.”</p>
<p>For more information on the forthcoming games – and the league itself – visit <a href="http://www.glasgowrollerderby.com/">www.glasgowrollerderby.com</a>. You can also visit <a href="http://www.britishchamps.com">www.britishchamps.com</a></p>
<p>The all-female GRD was the first roller derby league to be formed in Scotland – in 2007.</p>
<p>Since then the league has flown the flag across the world – competing in America twice, Europe on a number of occasions and throughout the UK.</p>
<p>The all-star A-team – the Irn Bruisers – are currently ranked 68<sup>th</sup> in the world by the Women’s Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA).</p>
<p>In addition, the UKRDA Q2 rankings have been released, and there has been a change at the top, with Glasgow Roller Derby leapfrogging Auld Reekie Roller Girls into the number one position.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">An inspirational new book celebrating the world of roller derby has been published – shining a light on the amazing artwork which has helped to immortalise its skaters and leagues.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">From the birth of modern-day roller derby in Texas in the early years of <img class="  wp-image-4617 alignright" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/04/bout-book1.jpg?w=194" alt="bout book1" width="306" height="463">the third millennium right through to the modern day, <em>Bout Book</em> is packed full of glorious artwork from all over the globe.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">From movie-inspired posters to surreal art, it's a highly-collectible, cult classic in the making - and it's supporting two terrific causes.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>Bout Book</em> has been created by roller derby skaters and fans to celebrate the sport and raise funds for the charities Regain
Sports and Womankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The book traces the transition of the sport – from 2002 to the present day – and features more than 150 leagues, with posters from Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK and the USA.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It includes posters promoting tournaments hosted by Glasgow Roller Derby and Granite City Roller Girls.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">One of the unique character traits of derby wherever it's played in the world is the strong sense of community which surrounds it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">That is beautifully illustrated in <em>Bout Book</em> – which shows the ingenuity, expansion and global progression of revival roller derby through its bout artwork.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Co-author Marie Danielle, a former Steam Roller with London Roller Girls, said: “The popularity of roller derby continues to roll on – with record numbers of people playing across the world – so this is a great time to celebrate its highs and history.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">“We show the expansion of roller derby through its bout artwork and feature over 150 leagues’ artwork, across 20 countries, including the very first modern roller derby poster from ‘Bad Girl Good Women’ and the very first tournament artwork.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">“It’s a collector’s item for anyone who plays derby, loves the sport and supports the derby community – all in aid of two superb charities.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">“<em>Bout Book</em> has been created by roller derby skaters and fans. Pivotal to the success of this book are the leagues and designers who kindly allowed us to include their bout artwork.<a href="2015/04/bout2.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-4618 alignleft" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/04/bout2.jpg?w=300" alt="Bout2" width="300" height="208"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">“One of the book's aims is to get people discovering who created their favourite artworks - who, where and when.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">“What better way of demonstrating the DIY ethic of roller derby as being for the skaters and by the skaters? This book simply couldn’t have happened without the support shown from the derby community.”</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Regain Sports is a registered charity which aims to improve the independence of all British men and women who have become tetraplegic as a result of a sports or leisure injury.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Meanwhile, Womankind Worldwide is an international charity working to support women and girls to improve the lives and communities in Africa, Asia and Latin America.</p>

<p>Playing in the world cup of any sport is a half-dreamt hope for 99% of the population – but for Scotland’s male derby players it’s a tantalisingly-realistic proposition.</p>
<p>Whether you’re playing football, Frisbee golf or Hungry Hippos – representing your country is an honour which is rarely bestowed.</p>
<p>You don’t need to have born beneath the sound of bagpipes, raised on a diet of Buckfast and thistles, and able to recite Rabbie Burns at the drop of a haggis.</p>
<p>Neither do you need to be Ballistic McWhistle or a tartan-clad Quadzilla.</p>
<p>You just need to have the heart of a lion (rampant), a willingness to learn and train, and enough team spirit charging through your veins to power a dozen Dillon Panthers.
</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Power of Scotland (PoS) is hosting the first of its try-outs on Saturday April 18 – a rare chance to put yourself up for selection for the 2016 Men’s Roller Derby World Cup in Canada.<a href="2015/04/1504054_10151952723786867_568742544_n.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-4607 alignright" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/04/1504054_10151952723786867_568742544_n.jpg?w=300" alt="1504054_10151952723786867_568742544_n" width="446" height="286"></a></p>
Jammers, blockers, triple-threats and everything in between – all are being challenged to step up and skate out by one of Scotland’s stars at the 2014 World Cup.
<p>Richard ‘Porky’ Abrams, the revered Tyne &amp; Fear enforcer, advises taking the Nike approach – just do it!</p>
<p>He said: “Being selected for PoS was a very proud moment. Since I was a child whenever I was asked what team I'd play for I always said Scotland, so getting in the PoS squad was a genuine honour.</p>
<p>“My advice to anyone considering trying out is ‘do it’. There's plenty of time to train and improve before the next World Cup. Selectors are looking for potential not the finished article. They're looking for team players who take direction and understand the game. Fitness can improve.</p>
<p>“PoS is ready to go to the next level and needs a range players from varied backgrounds. If you think you have a chance then you probably do! Look at the player of the first Euros, Mr Furieux had only been skating for a few months and he was incredible.”</p>
<p>Porky was part of the team who played at the 2014 World Cup and it was an experience he will never forget.</p>
<p>“The World Cup was incredible,” he said. “PoS played out of our skin. I got injured on the first day, my knee swelled up and I got p*ssed on the evening coz I was positive I wasn't going to play the USA the next day.</p>
<p>“I was gutted, but also slightly relieved as I'd watched them that day and I didn't fancy a beating 1000-0. Unbelievably when I woke up my knee was fine! So that meant I could play the USA. Great/oh sh*t!</p>
<p>“The highlight has to be PoS scoring 40 points against the USA. The highest score so far in the World Cup. As we lined up for the first jam of the second half I said to one of the USA team “just let us get one point!!”. He said: "if it were up to me I would, but if I did I'd never play for the USA again". So getting 40 points meant so much coz we earned every single one.</p>
<p>“My second highlight was being voted one of the all-star blockers of the tournament [all-star team pictured above]. Complete surprise! I was half-cut by the time they announced it and I genuinely didn't expect it. I didn't think I played as well as I could have.”</p>
<p>And to think it might not have been … without the timely intervention of Mrs Abrams.</p>
<p>Porky recalled: “My mum’s a Glaswegian and when I told her I could try out for England or Scotland she just answered "when is the Scotland try-out?" - which meant, you're trying out for Scotland and don't test me on this one!</p>
<p>“I'd played the majority of Tyne and Fear games to that point and found I was at a half-decent level. I'd also played quite a few of the lads in Scotland so I knew there was a good standard to work with if I made the cut.</p>
<p>“Also, geographically, living in Newcastle meant I was closer to practice with Scotland than people from Aberdeen. I also thought the support from Scottish fans would be better than any other at the World Cup and I wasn't wrong.”</p>
<p>The first Power of Scotland Try-out is on Saturday April 18 at 9.45am in Grangemouth Sports Complex. Try-out number two is in the same venue at 1.30pm on May 23.</p>
<p>After try-outs the selection committee will choose a training squad of 30 skaters, who will train together once a month and scrimmage until October.</p>
<p>In October the selection committee will come together again to watch a Scotland vs Scotland scrimmage made up of the training squad. Skaters will be marked using the selection criteria along with feedback from the coaches.</p>
<p>From here the 20-man squad which will go to Calgary will be selected and will go on to train till the World Cup.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for?</p>
<p>Head Coach Hannah Grant (aka Ginge) said: “We hope as many eligible skaters as possible attend one or both of the try-outs. Competing for your country is a pipe-dream for the vast majority of the population – but it could be a reality for Scotland’s male skaters.</p>
<p>“I would encourage everyone who meets the eligibility criteria to try out. It’s going to be a phenomenal journey to Canada 2016 – and we want as many people as possible to be part of it.</p>
<p>“The saddest words in the dictionary are ‘what if’ – you never know what could happen – don’t be left with regrets instead of amazing memories.</p>
<p>“As Porky says, you don’t need to be the best skater in the world – we will be looking for skating skills, tactical awareness, strategy implementation, good sportsmanship and the ability to operate as a team player and not a lone wolf.</p>
<p>“Try and work on all aspects of your game in the run up to try-outs. If you are an amazing jammer then work on rounding out your blocking. If you always skate backwards to block then try mixing it up and working on being able to fluidly block in lots of different styles.</p>
<p>“If you never pivot then work on that voice - work on being able to pull your wall together when it counts or switch up strategies when you need to. Make sure you are up to date on strategy and tactics, and also double-check your rules knowledge is up to date and relevant.”</p>

<p></p>
<p>On Sunday 19th April, Fierce Valley Roller Girls will be hosting a Fresh Meat taster session at Grangemouth Sports Complex.</p>
<p>The taster session is designed to let you try roller derby – with no commitment – to see if this is the sport for you. FVRG welcomes along men and women aged 18 and over, no previous skating experience necessary.</p>
<p><a href="2015/04/1520624_960949090583610_3770460212018297971_n.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-4602 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/04/1520624_960949090583610_3770460212018297971_n.jpg?w=212" alt="1520624_960949090583610_3770460212018297971_n" width="377" height="534"></a></p>
<p>On the day, you will be buddied up with an experienced skater to learn the basics of skating (and stopping!) safely. Your buddy will also loan you their equipment for the taster, so no need to buy anything just yet, except a mouthguard. At the end of the session, coaches will give you an overview of FVRG, and will answer any questions that you have about roller derby.</p>
<p>If you’re hooked after this taster session, you will be welcomed into a dedicated training programme for beginners. Once you progress through your training, regular assessments will be held to give you the opportunity to climb the ranks into Intermediate, then Advanced training sessions.</p>
<p>If you are interested in joining Fierce Valley Roller Girls, complete the registration form here http://www.fvrg.co.uk/get-involved/join-fvrg/ to reserve a place.</p>

<p>Glasgow’s own Mean City Roller Derby will welcome Manchester Roller Derby’s Chaos Engine to the town for a showdown soundtracked by everyone from Oasis and The Stone Roses to New Order and The Smiths.</p>
<p>Will Mean City be feeling ‘Supersonic’ with their ‘Wonderwalls’ or will the Chaos Engine skaters be ‘Made of Stone’? We’ll find out on Saturday April 25 at the ARC sportscentre.</p>
<p>It’s a very special occasion as Mean City will be joining forces with friends Glasgow Roller Derby to host a double-header.</p>
<p>Also on the bill will be Glasgow Roller Derby’s Cannie Gingers who will be playing Team Metal Legs – a select squad made up of skaters who have suffered and subsequently overcome breaks during the derby career.</p>
<p>That means fans will be treated to two full games for the price of one – an all-male game and an all-female game – showcasing some of the silkiest skills and high-octane thrills that this wonderful sport has to offer.</p>
<p>Alan Muir, Chair of Mean City Roller Derby, said: “I hope as many people as possible come along to the ARC on April 25 – it’s a great opportunity to get to know this wonderful sport, enjoy some groovy tunes and meet some of Scotland’s friendliest skaters.</p>
<p>“There’s no ‘Definitely Maybe’ about it – April 25 is going to be a fantastic celebration of spills, thrills and derby-aches.</p>
<p>“Get your ticket now – we’ll sell you a full seat, but you’ll be perched on the edge of it when these four teams take to the track.”</p>
<p>Alan added: “We can’t wait to welcome Manchester Roller Derby’s Chaos Engine to town – they are great league and a fantastic group of people.</p>
<p>“And we’re delighted to be hosting a double-header as our good friends at Glasgow Roller Derby take on the magnificent Team Metal Legs.</p>
<p>“Come along with all the family – there will be refreshments, merchandise and more on the day too. To quote The Stone Roses - it's ‘What the World is Waiting For’!”
