As well as a second WFTDA Playoffs showcasting Sweden, and giving the UK it's second chance at a Champs place, there's equally exciting action in the USA for Brussels Derby Pixies in California; the finals of Victoria's Statewide Stampede tournament in Australia; the start of Finland's Suomi Cup for 2019/2020... and much more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

After the success of previous Sur5al tournaments, FVRG are adding an additional detail this year: all teams are coed (or "open", as we believe the newly popular term is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;22nd&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;October&lt;/strong&gt; sees this event, with a Harry Potter theme embraced by many of the teams, at Fierce Valley's usual venue of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Grangemouth+Sports+Complex/@56.0117322,-3.7230718,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x488879aaeb85b4ed:0x204ad804f85c6304!8m2!3d56.0117322!4d-3.7208831"&gt;Grangemouth Sports Complex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of Sur5al is that you can host a relatively large number of teams in a surprisingly small space of time, and the Scottish roller derby community have taken full advantage of this, with the following teams signed up to skate:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Golden Snatches&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#ffff00;background-color:#000000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yellow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Dita Von Cheese&lt;/em&gt; [Fierce Valley Roller Girls])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Snapes on a Plane&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#3366ff;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Thump'her&lt;/em&gt; [Fierce Valley Roller Girls])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Slytherwins&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#008000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Fury Eyes Only&lt;/em&gt; [Auld Reekie Roller Girls])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Block Street Boys&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Black&lt;/strong&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Tiny Tearaway&lt;/em&gt; [Dundee Roller Girls])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Neville loves Prada&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#808080;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Khileesi&lt;/em&gt; [Dundee Roller Girls])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Why so Sirius?&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#ff6600;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orange&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Sadie O'Hades&lt;/em&gt; [Glasgow Roller Derby])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Immobulud&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#ffffff;background-color:#000000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Skimbleshanks&lt;/em&gt; [Mean City Roller Derby])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Nameless Ones&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Sylk&lt;/em&gt; [Mean City Roller Derby])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Snitches and Bitches&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#ff00ff;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pink&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Hazzard&lt;/em&gt; [New Town Roller Girls])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Magic Hot Pocket&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#800080;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Harm&lt;/em&gt; [Lothian Derby Dolls])&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
With ten teams taking part, the usual Sur5al round robin format will require a massive &lt;em&gt;45&lt;/em&gt; bouts, each lasting a single jam, for a total of 90 minutes of track time (probably approaching 2 hours of total time).
&lt;p&gt;In total, we are told that, in addition to those teams providing captains, skaters from Bairn City Rollers, Ayrshire Roller Derby, Granite City Roller Derby, Granite City Brawlers, and Capital City Roller Derby are also represented, making this a truly inclusive event for the Scottish derby community. (Even the officials are represented, as Block Street Boys Captain Tiny Tearaway is returning to the track from her now usual Refereeing role for this event.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doors open at &lt;strong&gt;14:45&lt;/strong&gt; for a prompt 15:00 start. Tickets cost &lt;strong&gt;£5&lt;/strong&gt; (+ booking fee) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2639837"&gt;online from Brown Paper Tickets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;£7&lt;/strong&gt; on the door (under 14s free, with an adult). Harry Potter fancy dress welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alison Renton's event 'sur5ors' was a massive success just as her previous charity driven derby events have been. This event was for the Benefit of both Glendrick Roost Animal Welfare Centre and St Andrew's First Aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the day started, and set up and formalities concluded, the audience was let in and the real buzz started. With the 12 teams lacing up their skates and slipping on pads anticipation was in the air. As the first whistle blew for the first heat and teams started clashing it was clear there was a vast spectrum of skating talent on show. From ARRG and GRD dominating the skating down to NTRG and VRD representing the newer leagues everyone displayed their talent with gusto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day went on with jam after jam holding the audience on the edges of their seats. Where some jams saw some teams dominate where others brought the audience to uproars as they saw teams comeback from the brink of losing only to climb up the rankings ladder of the tournament. Each team was nothing but lovely to one another before and after they faced each other. Generally the atmosphere between skaters was extremely friendly with the teams mingling between heats and chatting on the benches between jams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearing the end of the tournament excitement was running at its peak with the last few jams of the day tearing up some parts of the rankings and seeing some of the newer teams come to equal blows with some of the harder skating teams.In the end the results came in and each team was put on the rankings board in the positions they had proudly earned throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For us over at NTRG the day was everything we wanted it to be. Having our girls win two jams and finish 11th was a massive boost for us. Not to mention how encouraging our cheering section in the crowd was! It gave us some perspective of where we stand in the wider derby community and it's an event that we'll cherish as a building block to our success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the skaters provided entertainment on track the day was held up by the vast scores of NSOs, referees and tournament crew who tirelessly worked away to keep the event running smoothly. Without them the day would have not been the success it was and the skaters who took part felt their benefit immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results are as followed:&lt;/p&gt;

A lot has happened at CCRD since then; Sassenick has done us the honour of sharing their adventures with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. When we spoke in February 2013, you were planning your first Fresh Meat &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;taster for April, and then another took place in September. How have you found the  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;recruitment process? Can you introduce us to the new skaters at Capital City who  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;joined in 2013? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Recruitment has been a bit hit and miss. Each time we've advertised a new Fresh Meat session, we've initially received plenty of interest, but getting people to actually turn up, and more importantly, come back for a second and a third time, has been tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;The April Fresh Meat was a bit of a false start due to low numbers, but the September program has been very successful, with a number of the newer skaters now very close to passing their Minimum Skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;I think our biggest success story is HaJuken, who’s gone from absolute beginner back in February to skating in public bouts and, most impressively, helping his team into joint 3rd place in the Jakey Sur5al in December.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/02/hadjuken-sur5al.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-3300" alt="HadJuken jamming at Sur5al 2013" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/02/hadjuken-sur5al.jpg" width="614" height="921"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; HadJuken jamming at Sur5al 2013 - Photo courtesy of Ian McCreadie
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. How are you finding the balance between training skaters at a beginner level, and also those at a more advanced level? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;It is very difficult to find the right balance of training for newer skaters, intermediates and advanced skaters, especially when we currently only have one training session a week. At the outset of 2013 this wasn't so much of an issue, but as the year progressed, and more inexperienced skaters joined the league, we found ourselves with a wide range of skating skills and levels to cater for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;We knew that this is an issue that all new leagues face sooner or later, so we assessed all of our skaters and created a training plan that would cater for everyone’s needs. We now split our training session into two halves: the first half covering skating skills that are needed for Mins, which our intermediate and advance skaters join in to help our newer skater’s progress. The second is focused on the skills we all need for playing derby. It has worked out really well and all the boys here at CCRD really put everything into each session, so much so that you can visibly see them advancing every week.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Your range of merchandise is very impressive! Capital City stalls are regularly spotted at Auld Reekie Roller Girls bouts, and at many local men's bouts. How important is it for you to attend these events and chat to the spectators? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Everyone loves a unicorn! We try to get a presence at as many bouts in and around Edinburgh as we can. It helps us to not only to promote ourselves, but also men’s derby in general. There are plenty of guys who attend women’s bouts who know very little or nothing at all about the men’s game and leagues. We aim to inform them and hopefully recruit them. A few of our current skaters were recruited at bouts in this way and at the time didn't even know there were any men’s teams in Scotland. That said, it’s important to find a balance when we’re setting up shop at other teams bouts, because until we’re actually giving something back in the form of, you know, actually playing Roller Derby in public, we run the risk of looking more like a clothing brand than a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;As an aside, because I’ll never stop getting excited by this fact, every so often people submit picture to &lt;a title="CCRD on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/CapitalCityRollerDerby?fref=ts" target="_blank"&gt;our Facebook Page&lt;/a&gt; of themselves wearing our merch. Last September an ARRG skater (shout out to Terrifying Tink!) posted a pic, taken on a visit to &lt;a title="Five Stride Skate Shop Website" href="http://www.fivestrideskateshop.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Five Stride Skate Shop&lt;/a&gt; in New York, of her wearing Capital City t-shirt while standing next to Bonnie Thunders &amp;amp; OMGWTF of Gotham Girls Roller Derby! How cool is that!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. All of the Scottish Men's Teams have certainly put their stamp on the roller &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;derby scene and are no longer seen as the 'newbies' trying to catch up with the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;women's teams. Starting a roller derby league is a big enough challenge - never &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mind introducing another culture at the same time! Can you tell us about the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;challenges you faced along the way, and how you overcame them to rise to the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;position you are in now? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;We were lucky here at CCRD that we were started by a group of &lt;a title="The Jakey Bites on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheJakeyBites" target="_blank"&gt;Jakey Bites&lt;/a&gt; skaters. They saw a gap for an Edinburgh-based team when other regional men’s teams were starting to appear, and so CCRD was born. This gave us a solid foundation and a wealth of experience to draw on, not only from their experiences with the Jakeys, but also with Women's leagues as well as some of them were previously (some of them still are) referees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Even with this we have ran into our fair share of challenges. Recruitment is always the big one, as are hall costs. Unfortunately these go hand in hand, as without skating members we can't pay for hall time. Hall costs are always a big hurdle for new leagues and we’re no exception. It seems everywhere we look is expensive! This has led us to make sure to maximise our time we have on track each week, which in turn has helped to focus all our skaters at training. We are planning more Fresh Meat intakes throughout 2014 to hopefully add to our ranks, whilst still looking at alternative training venues to help us reduce hall costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;On a more positive note, I think the biggest obstacle that 2013 raised for was the need to actually become a team, rather than just a group of guys that skated together. Strangely enough, I think that happened pretty soon after we decided on our logo. It’s surprising how readily grown men will rally around a unicorn without a hint of irony, but it’s definitely become ingrained in our culture now.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. It was very exciting to see the establishment of the Men's National Team - The &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power of Scotland - last year. Are many Capital City skaters on The Power of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotland roster? What opportunities do you think a Men's National Team will bring &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to the sport? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;We were all very excited about the establishment of &lt;a title="Power of Scotland on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/PowerOfScotland" target="_blank"&gt;Power of Scotland &lt;/a&gt;as a bouting team. There’s 4 skaters representing CCRD skating with Power of Scotland, two of which were voted in as the captain and vice-captain for POS. There is Dafty, Tequila Jammer, Judderjam and WKDeid (aka V for Vieneta); names I am sure followers of Men's Roller Derby will recognise from the Jakey Bites bouts. Also Ginge, their line-up, has also been on the side-lines of CCRD since the beginning, so we’ve definitely got a lot of representation in the national team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/02/pos.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-3303    " alt="Power of Scotland Team Photo" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/02/pos.jpg" width="614" height="409"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Power of Scotland - Photo courtesy of CCRD&lt;br&gt;Back row: WKDeid 4th from right; JudderJam 2nd from right.&lt;br&gt;Front row: Tequila 1st from left.&lt;br&gt;Very front row: Ginge!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;It’s hard to say what sort of effect a national team will have in Scotland though. We’re in the fairly unique situation of already having an all-star team with the Jakey Bites, so the benefits of a supra-league team have always in a way been visible within CCRD. That said, our coaches are already bringing back new tactics and ideas from Power of Scotland which are definitely having a positive effect on our team and our game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;On top of that, with not only the Men’s World Cup in March, but the Women's in December, hopefully there will be more exposure of the sport in general here in Scotland and throughout the UK. It would be really good if the attention the sport is getting on a national level could feed back to help leagues, not only in terms of promotion and recruitment, but also in bringing in new sponsors and representation in the national media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. What would you consider as Capital City's biggest achievement in 2013? Are &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;there any highlights that stand out from a very busy year? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;2013 was a very busy year for us, but we don’t have much in the way of visible achievements. Behind the scenes, our biggest achievement of 2013 has been the successful changing of the way we run our training to best help and suit every one’s needs. This has helped build a drive and determination at CCRD to get us ready and in shape for bouting in 2014. Everyone has put in so much hard work and has a fantastic focus of getting us bouting in 2014, to make 2014 the year of the unicorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;We had our first Fresh Meat pass their Mins which I think is a big sign of success for the league as a whole, but most of the things that I think reflect well on us, can be seen in the successes of our members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;There have been a few more highlights through the year such as a few new skaters playing in their first bout, CCRD being represented at the co-ed charity bouts last year and CCRD being represented in the POS line up to name a few.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. What would you consider as your personal biggest achievement with Capital &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;City in 2013? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;That’s a surprisingly tough question, because everything feels like a big achievement when I first master it, but after a few weeks it becomes just another skill. I think the best feeling though was when I managed to skate 28 laps in 5 minutes. My previous PB was 22, I was on new skates, only two weeks back after a two month absence, and the previous week I’d skated headfirst into a wall in the attempt! To actually get the laps I needed after that was such an amazing feeling, even if I had to sit down for the next half hour to avoid passing out!&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. And finally, what are Capital City's plans for 2014? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Bouting! We’ve already got a couple of dates pencilled in for scrimmages with other leagues, and we’re definitely on track to have a public bout by the end of the year. Recruitment is also going to continue to be a big focus, and the big aim there is to have enough numbers so that we can have additional training sessions to better accommodate a range of abilities. On top of that? We’re just going to keep having fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16 teams of 3 females plus 2 males signed up to take part in the tournament, representing many of the Scottish Roller Derby leagues, as well as English teams: Barrow Infernos, Furness Firecrackers, and Blackpool Roller Derby. This year, the event was open to the public. All door takings plus each teams' entry fee was donated to the winner's charity of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 16 teams were split into 4 groups of 4 teams, with a variety of festive names! Each team played against the other three teams in their group, in 3 sets of 2 minute jams played back-to-back with no time-outs or call-offs. The team who won the most games from their Group then progressed through to the Semi Final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day ran extremely smoothly, with Dafty from The Jakeys guiding the teams through their group stages. The NSOs did a fantastic job of telling each team who was up next to play, and the Ref Crews were seamless in their switch-over between games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian McCreadie - an independent photographer - was at The Meadowbank to capture all of the action from the day. He has kindly supplied all of the following images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group A Winner: Team 13&lt;/strong&gt;, representing Fierce Valley Roller Girls and Capital City Roller Derby. Their team skaters were Tiny Tearaway (FVRG); Maz-Manian Devil (FVRG); Fun Ghoul (FVRG); WK Deid (CCRD); HaJuken (CCRD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group D Winner: Lamb 2.0&lt;/strong&gt;, representing Auld Reekie Roller Girls, Dundee Roller Girls, and Capital City Roller Derby. Their team skaters were Ginge (ARRG); Tequila Jammer (CCRD); Milky (DRG); Kiki (ARRG) and Dafty (CCRD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/12/k4z8740.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-3091  " title="Group D Winner: Lamb 2.0" alt="Group D Winner: Lamb 2.0" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/12/k4z8740.jpg" width="614" height="380"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Group D Winner: Lamb 2.0 - Image courtesy of Ian McCreadie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a hard-fought semi finals round, Festive Periods and Lamb 2.0 came head-to-head in the finals. Lamb 2.0 claimed the victory, and will be donating the takings from the event to a charity of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full line-ups of each team is as follows. Although there were a couple of changes on the day, this should give you an idea of the talent that competed in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Windsor Roller Girls' Website" href="http://windsorrollergirls.com/sur5al" target="_blank"&gt;Windsor Roller Girls hosted the first Sur5al challenge&lt;/a&gt; in April 2012, and now the format of a five-a-side, one-day tournament has spread all around the world. Skaters from all the Scottish leagues have been invited to form teams of 5 to take part in The Jakey's event, including co-ed teams. A few English, Welsh and Irish teams may even pop up on the day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament will be open to the public with all profits going to the winning team's nominated charity. Join the &lt;a title="SURV5AL 2013 Facebook Event" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/317269091746500/" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Event&lt;/a&gt; for the latest news.&lt;/p&gt;
