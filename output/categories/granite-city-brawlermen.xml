&lt;p&gt;For fans of Scotland's first Co-ed league, the good news is that this weekend sees the end of the drought, as BCR host a double-header of roller derby action in traditional venue &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Grangemouth+Sports+Complex/@56.0116517,-3.7227819,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x488879aaeb85b4ed:0x204ad804f85c6304!8m2!3d56.0116487!4d-3.7205879"&gt;Grangemouth Sports Complex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, from &lt;strong&gt;2pm Saturday.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, BCR's women's team, the &lt;strong&gt;Central Belters&lt;/strong&gt;, will be taking to the track against &lt;strong&gt;Belfast City Rockets&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the Belters' first bout in their new kit - retiring the old grey-and-green in favour of a new logo (a howling wolf) in what used to be the Skelpies-only scheme of red-and-blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belfast City are ranked by FlatTrackStats as extremely close in power to the Central Belters - the bout is assigned as being &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/80412/rankings"&gt;almost 50:50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for each team to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7363" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/05/received_10154393044162044.jpeg" alt="Central Belters Wolf" width="612" height="612"&gt; The new Central Belters logo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this, it's Bairn City's men's team, the &lt;strong&gt;Skelpies&lt;/strong&gt;, up against Aberdeen's finest, the &lt;strong&gt;Granite City Brawlers &lt;/strong&gt;(who have also switched from Brawlermen to Brawlers since their founding). While the Brawlers have played several games in an unofficial or closed capacity, this is their first Public Bout, so it's a chance to see how the newest Scottish men's league perform!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As this is GCB's first bout, FlatTrackStats is unable to predict the result of this match up - but as GCB and the Skelpies both have skaters in Power of Scotland, it might be closer than you expect!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are available online at: &lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bairn-city-rollers-double-header-tickets-24929152767"&gt;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bairn-city-rollers-double-header-tickets-24929152767&lt;/a&gt; for only £6.34 (we assume the odd value is due to processing fees).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bairn city rollers</category><category>belfast city rockets</category><category>central belters</category><category>granite city brawlermen</category><category>skelpies</category><category>upcoming bouts</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/05/31/bairn-city-roll-into-2017/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2016 10:53:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Powers of Two at Mean City</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/05/24/powers-of-two-at-mean-city/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/MeanCityRollerDerby/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mean City Roller Derby&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; obviously like the number two. That's the only explanation for the preponderance of twos in this weekend's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/487160101472894/"&gt;upcoming event&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; they're hosting, at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/ARC:+Health+and+Fitness/@55.8662183,-4.2519236,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4888441f10416197:0x3a9426f40d4b58b7!8m2!3d55.8662153!4d-4.2497349"&gt;ARC Sports Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Glasgow.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7335" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/05/11707838_666231253513298_2828507735651128838_o.jpg?w=1024" alt="11707838_666231253513298_2828507735651128838_o" width="1024" height="384"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is this a double header, with &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; exciting bouts to experience, but both bouts have their own multiplicative factors as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headlining, we have Scotland's National Men's Roller Derby team, Power of Scotland, facing off against "The Other Guys" - the "&lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; best Scottish men's skaters" from four (&lt;em&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;!) Scottish leagues: Mean City themselves, Capital City, Bairn City's Skelpies and Granite City's Brawlermen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/PowerOfScotland/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power of Scotland&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;are less than two months away from the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://mrdwc.com/"&gt;World Cup in Calgary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and this is an important fixture both for training and also fundraising. As well as donations direct to PoS, the Team Physio (Dundee Roller Girls' Goldginger) Claire will be offering physio for donations [she also has a separate fundraiser &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.justgiving.com/Claire-Semple2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;] - and official Team Photographer Laura MacDonald will also be in attendance [she's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/PoSLauraCalgary"&gt;raising money too&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;!].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second up, Mean City's own co-ed team (who I don't think actually have a name yet) are facing off against a &lt;em&gt;double&lt;/em&gt;-league mashup of Capital City Roller Derby and Lothian Derby Dolls: "Fear and Lothian". The two Edinburgh-based leagues have been working pretty closely in preparation for this game, and we believe that Fear and Lothian is going to become a longer standing collaboration - there will be new merch available at the bout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With both bouts containing exhibition teams, there's no stats to predict the outcomes - so the only way to see what will happen is to come along!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://meancityrollerderby.com/tickets.php"&gt;£5 in advance&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;£6&lt;/strong&gt; on the door (under-14s free).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doors open at &lt;strong&gt;11:30am&lt;/strong&gt; for an approximately midday start this &lt;strong&gt;Saturday 28th May&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bairn city rollers</category><category>capital city roller derby</category><category>granite city brawlermen</category><category>lothian derby dolls</category><category>mean city roller derby</category><category>power of scotland</category><category>upcoming bouts</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/05/24/powers-of-two-at-mean-city/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2016 09:37:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Upcoming Events Roundup!</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/01/13/upcoming-events-roundup/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scottish Roller Derby is just starting to emerge from its traditional month of hibernation, and there's already a lot of derby events scheduled for the next few weeks. To get you started on your next year of Derby, we've collected them together in one place for you with handy links!
We’ve already covered most of the derby recruitment events &lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/01/03/start-derby-in-the-new-year/"&gt;in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, so here we present mostly bouts and fundraising. We should note, however, a few addenda to the fresh meat article:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;Firstly, &lt;strong&gt;Helgin Roller Derby&lt;/strong&gt; have completely filled up their attendance list for their fresh meat, and are now closed for additional skaters until their next recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;Secondly, just missing out on our article, &lt;strong&gt;Ayrshire Roller Derby&lt;/strong&gt; also have a recruitment event scheduled for &lt;strong&gt;Tuesday 26th January&lt;/strong&gt;, starting at &lt;strong&gt;7pm&lt;/strong&gt; at the &lt;strong&gt;Magnum Leisure Centre, Irvine&lt;/strong&gt;. There is some kit available, but you are advised to contact ahead of time &lt;a href="mailto:ayshirerollerderby@gmail.com"&gt;ayshirerollerderby@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lothian Derby Dolls&lt;/strong&gt; also announced recruitment very recently, with a session planned for &lt;strong&gt;31st January&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Musselburgh Sport Centre&lt;/strong&gt;, starting at &lt;strong&gt;1pm&lt;/strong&gt;. You are advised to contact &lt;a href="mailto:newskaters@lothianderbydolls.com"&gt;newskaters@lothianderbydolls.com&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The Scottish Derby bout calendar starts on the &lt;strong&gt;30th of January&lt;/strong&gt;, with 3 bouts occurring:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glasgow Roller Derby&lt;/strong&gt; A and B are taking on Vagine Regime UK in a double-header hosted in the Lagoon Centre, Paisley. &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/440385519419560/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/440385519419560/&lt;/a&gt; There's also the second annual GRD Drag Party planned after this event, for which details &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/156611594708195/"&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;Over in Edinburgh, &lt;strong&gt;Auld Reekie Roller Girls&lt;/strong&gt; are also holding their first bout of the year, with the Reserves taking on Roller Derby Dresden. &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/918798478210693/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/918798478210693/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;Meanwhile, down in Newcastle, Men's National Team &lt;strong&gt;Power of Scotland&lt;/strong&gt; are taking on Tyne and Fear B as part of a double header with Newcastle Roller Girls. &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1829763710583763/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/1829763710583763/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The action doesn't stop the week after, as the &lt;strong&gt;6th of February&lt;/strong&gt; sees:
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fierce Valley Roller Girls&lt;/strong&gt; host a 12-team Charity Sur5al tournament at The Peak, Stirling. &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/908140529265523/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/908140529265523/&lt;/a&gt; There's also an &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1507929376179373/"&gt;afterparty event&lt;/a&gt; for the tournament, which is sure to be well attended!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;Also on the 6th, Power of Scotland have a fundraiser up in Aberdeen, as &lt;strong&gt;Granite City Brawlermen&lt;/strong&gt; host a Quiz Night in Sinatra's Bar. &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1711963732359161/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/1711963732359161/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The &lt;strong&gt;13th of February&lt;/strong&gt; continues to be lucky for derby enthusiasts, as we have another two events to choose from:
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;In Edinburgh, &lt;strong&gt;Lothian Derby Dolls&lt;/strong&gt; take on Dundee Roller Girls' Bonnie Colliders at the Jack Kane Centre, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1537726313212932/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/1537726313212932/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;Meanwhile, playing away at Eston Leisure Centre,Middlesborough, &lt;strong&gt;Mean City Roller Derby&lt;/strong&gt; take on Teesside Skate Invaders in a double header hosted by Middlesborough Milk Rollers. &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/370810093043423/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/370810093043423/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Certainly, many leagues across the country traditionally run a fresh meat recruitment in January or early February just to take advantage of any newly enthused skaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, there's a good distribution of Fresh Meat sessions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, and a bit urgent for those who want to be involved - &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/750196985110434/"&gt;Glasgow Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are holding their Fresh Meat session on &lt;strong&gt;Sunday 10th January&lt;/strong&gt; - just a week away! You'll need your own skates and pads to take part, and of course GRD recommend &lt;a href="http://www.5thblockerskates.co.uk/"&gt;5th Blocker Skates&lt;/a&gt; to get you the right kit. The initial signup session will be held at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Glasgow-Club-Drumoyne/190810237616343"&gt;Glasgow Club Drumoyne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;and entry is free for the first session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up in time, Edinburgh's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1652424528374019/"&gt;Auld Reekie Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are holding their Fresh Meat session a week later on &lt;strong&gt;Sunday 17th January&lt;/strong&gt;. You only need to a mouthguard to attend their session, for hygiene reasons; ARRG will supply kit for the initial tryout session. The initial sesson, and all subsequent training is at the&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jack-Kane-Sports-Centre/152896351412178"&gt; Jack Kane Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and entry to the initial session is just £5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elgin's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/168691136822816/"&gt;Helgin Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are holding a "learn to skate" session, co-hosted with Aberdeen's Granite City Roller Derby, on &lt;strong&gt;Saturday 30th January&lt;/strong&gt;. As with ARRG, you'll need to bring a mouthguard, but other kit will be provided. The session will be held at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Elgin-Community-Centre/286953997983978"&gt;Elgin Community Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and entry is free. This is a &lt;em&gt;co-ed&lt;/em&gt; session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Livingston's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/636910396412245/"&gt;New Town Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; have an extensive array of taster and meetup sessions across January and February. There's a chance to &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/551015165051330/"&gt;Meet The Skaters&lt;/a&gt; in a pub setting on &lt;strong&gt;Friday January 22nd&lt;/strong&gt;, in the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wetherspoons/105356126214627"&gt;Wetherspoons&lt;/a&gt; in the Almondvale Centre . The actual taster session for would-be-skaters is on &lt;strong&gt;Saturday February 6th&lt;/strong&gt;, in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Blackburn-Community-Centre/298761240230260"&gt;Blackburn Community Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. NTRG request that attendees message them before the event to allow arrangements to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the North, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1732447053650457/"&gt;Inverness City Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are holding a fresh meat/beginners session on &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday 3rd February&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, you'll need to bring a mouthguard, but some kit will be available (although you're advised to contact ICRD ahead of time with your shoe size). The initial session will be at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Hilton-Community-Centre-918990224784740/"&gt;Hilton Community Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;; we have no information in entry fees, but the session is &lt;em&gt;co-ed,&lt;/em&gt; as with Helgin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for guys who want to play Derby in the Aberdeen area, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1708084226107265/"&gt;Granite City Brawlermen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are holding their intake on &lt;strong&gt;Saturday 6th February&lt;/strong&gt;. You'll probably want to bring a mouthguard, but if you contact GCB ahead of time, they can arrange a loan of the rest of the kit. The session will be held at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Aberdeen-Lads-Club-209093469130951/"&gt;Aberdeen Lads Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, there is no information on entry fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also know that several other leagues are planning intakes in the next few months; we'll keep you informed as and when those are announced!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>auld reekie roller girls</category><category>fresh meat</category><category>glasgow roller derby</category><category>granite city brawlermen</category><category>helgin roller derby</category><category>inverness city roller derby</category><category>new town roller girls</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/01/03/start-derby-in-the-new-year/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2016 10:26:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Getting to Know Power of Scotland</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/11/27/getting-to-know-power-of-scotland/</link><dc:creator>caleykapowski</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekend will see Birmingham host the 4 Nations Roller Derby Tournament. This weekend's extravaganza will feature Team England, Team Wales, Team France and Team Scotland.  I managed to wangle an opportunity to speak to 3 members of Team Scotland's Power of Scotland; Andy Morris, Skate Plissken  and Chris Mathieson, mainly I wanted to be nosy about how the Power Scotland have been preparing for the Wold Cup in Calgary. Since starting this blog piece, I have been informed that Plissken and Chris Mathieson have been voted in as the captains of Power of Scotland,  huge well done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/11/received_10156211484200587.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full" title="received_10156211484200587.jpeg" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/11/received_10156211484200587.jpeg" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left to right: Mathieson , Plissken and Morris (photo credit Nikki Morris)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the style of many tv hosts, I kicked off by asking a bit more about the individual skater, their history with sport and team affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up was Plissken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long have you been skating for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come January, 3 years, with no real prior skating experience…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which team do you currently skate for? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nottingham Rolled Derby’s Super Smash Brollers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a history in any other sports? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I grew up playing rugby, then moved on to American football for a little while when at uni…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was Chris Mathieson, also known as Pudz and 'that guy who scored the first points in Power of Scotland vs Team USA in the 2014 Mens Roller Derby World Cup'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long have you been skating for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been skating since July 2011, so just under four and a half years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which team do you currently skate for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granite City Brawlermen from Aberdeen and Power of Scotland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a history in any other sports?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to play football as a kid but I wasn’t great at it, other than that a little bit of street hockey when I was 10 but I sprained my ankle once and never put on a pair of skates again until I tried roller derby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my last victim for interrogation was Andy Morris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long have you been skating for? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Brawlermen started in November 2013, I did my first scrim in December 2014 after the Womens World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which team do you currently skate for? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granite City Brawlermen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a history in any other sports? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played Rugby at school, I snowboard, Surf, Cycling, Motorbikes I’m a petrolhead!
Pre Selection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then I wanted to learn more about the selection process for Power of Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When did you first try out for Team Scotland and did you try out more than once?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plissken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 2 try out selection dates; I could only make one as SSB were playing a game on the other, so I went up in May having no idea what to expect. A little nervous to say the least! But after 4 hours of skate drills, derby drills and an hour scrim I felt good about how I had performed… followed by the news I had made the 30-strong selection squad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathieson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended both tryouts in April and May 2015, and then we had to wait a month or so for the decision. It felt like forever between tryout and selection which is understandable as the quality in Scottish roller derby has increased so much since the last tournament in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making the 30 we had to train as a team for the next 4 months in the run up to a selection bout hosted by the lovely Dundee Roller Girls. The 30 played against each other in this game showcasing the best talent in Scottish men’s derby. It was a high pressure game but with a score tied until the last jam it showed how well the teams were split which made it even more exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later we found out if we had made the squad going to Calgary. I found out the news just as I was flying to London for a weekend away so a fair few celebration drinks were had and maybe even a wee visit to Double Threat Skates to get sized up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was there a long wait before you knew about being on the top 20 squad? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email for the final 20 came through a week after the PoS vs PoS game, that was the longest week ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plissken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had made the selection squad I knew I had to work hard, so I went to the 4x training sessions and 1x Scotland v Scotland (two teams made up of the selection squads) and took everything I could from each session, going back to my home league with something to work on. We were told in the first week of November if we had made the final 20, news I was very relieved and excited to hear. Now we have our final 20 we are working towards what we can take to the world cup and showing the world we the Power of Scotland can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then went on to discuss how selection for the Mens' Roller Derby World Cup had impacted their training regimes. I've seen various skater training videos (and some montages) going around on social media, so I wondered if this was typical behaviour and the guys did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you changed your training regime since being selected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plissken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely! There was no way I was going to meet other world class teams without stepping up my game. I joined a gym (not been in years), started eating better, and am currently well on the way to quitting smoking! At the gym I have been working on strength training, HIIT training (if you don’t know it, check it out) and over all endurance. This is to help strength, balance, speed and recovery time between jams. I’ve cut out take-outs, pop (well, mostly ;) can’t beat a pre-game irn-bru) and snacks (and I tell you, you don’t want them as much as you think you do!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended the gym on the run up to the PoS vs PoS game and pre tryouts quite a lot and since then I’ve taken it easy, come January I’ll be back to 5 -6 days a week. My diet hasn’t really changed a huge amount, I eat a lot of protein otherwise I don’t have the energy levels to play my best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathieson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been focused on making the Calgary squad for the last year, so have been hitting the gym since January, including some 5am sessions. There have been a few blips in the training regime and diet along the way but since making the 20 I’m back properly at the gym in preparation for 4 Nations. I also cut McDonald’s out which used to be my standard post game/training meal, which is tough seeing as there’s at least 4 between Grangemouth and Aberdeen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then wanted to find out more about Team Scotland training.  The roster for Power of Scotland features skaters from Scotland and England and as small as the UK is, so it can't be easy gathering everyone together for training. Team Scotland training takes place once a month in Grangemouth Leisure Centre, from 2016 this will increase to twice a month in the run up to the Mens Roller Derby World Cup.
I wondered if this regular travel necessitated taking time off of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plissken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a 700mile round trip for me but I generally don’t take time off.  It’s travel up, train for 4 hrs, travel back down, all within about 30 hours...and the rest!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathieson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been training monthly pre final selection but are ramping it up to twice a month in the new year. We train in Grangemouth which is about a 5 hour round trip from Aberdeen. It’s a long journey which I’ve sadly gotten used to and am currently looking into the options of a timeshare there with Momo. No time off work, but maybe just a little tired the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been training once a month but from January onwards its every two weeks. I think there will always be things getting in the way of training even more so for the guys down south, cost has a large factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a team of 20 plus bench and lineup and management is expensive no matter where you go but Canada is pretty far away and flights are not cheap. Next I quizzed the chaps on what they are doing in order to raise funds for this amazing opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathieson filled me in on Power of Scotland's fundraising activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a few fundraising events on at the moment, there are 3 skaters fighting it out to raise the most money to avoid losing their beards, craft fayres and some guest coaching sessions all over the country. I’ve just been up to Elgin training Helgin Roller Derby and Inverness City Roller Derby, which was a pleasure, giving some of them their first experience in wall and pack work drills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a general fundraising page, which if anyone has a few pennies to spare to help the team it would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;http://gogetfunding.com/allpowernobull/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are proud again to have our uniforms sponsored by MP Locums. MP Locums place Hospital Doctors and GPs into locum work matching your experience and qualifications to your professional goals and ambitions. As a preferred supplier to NHS Scotland they have a variety of locum positions short and long term available throughout Scot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/11/fb_img_1448576822432.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full" title="FB_IMG_1448576822432.jpg" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/11/fb_img_1448576822432.jpg" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally we got onto the subject that so many of us as looking forward to, the Mens Roller Derby World Cup 2016. The Men's Roller Derby World Cup 2016 in Calgary will be a first time for Morris and Plissken with Mathieson making his second appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What part of the World Cup are you most looking forward to? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere at the last one was incredible, I can’t wait for that excitement again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plissken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, challenging myself against other national skaters, I know it’s not going to be easy but how good is it going to feel if I can get lead on Johnathan R? We can all dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathieson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than going to Canada, which is number 2 on the list of countries I’d love to visit, I’m looking forward to the challenge of our group stage. It’s been described as the ‘Group of Death’ but I think we can come out of it strong and it will make for some exciting games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Team are you most excited to play against?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathieson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to us playing the USA again. Last time we managed to score 40 points against them which was a big deal and I think with the team we have this year we will show them how far Scottish roller derby has progressed since then. Goal – first blood!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plissken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USA, that’s the dream but I’m sure its everyone on the team has the dream to be selected for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you could be in any other bracket, which bracket would you choose and why? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plissken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t! we have a great set of teams to play, and we have the 6 teams instead of 5 so we get loads of games to play, plus I get to go against the giants, Team USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I would chose any of the other brackets, the bracket we are in will be the one to watch ☺&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathieson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d go into the Orange group so that we could play against Argentina, they were the heroes of the tournament last time, El Pibe &amp;lt;3!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be Mathieson's second time representing Power of Scotland in the Men's Roller Derby World Cup. I wanted to find out if this had had an impact on his 2016 training regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You played in the World Cup in 2014, are you doing anything different this time to prepare?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last tournament was one of the best weekends of my life but on the lead up to it I was studying for my professional exams so I had to juggle the two with derby sometimes taking a back seat. This time around though this is my main focus and I’ll be putting everything I’ve got into it, attending as much training and scrimmage as possible. I’ve watched the footage of myself in the last world cup and although I scored the first points against USA it’s a horrible jam to watch, so many falls. But watching it back gives me the drive to do better this time round, upping my game and upping my fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally I asked for their predictions for the World Cup...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathieson
Scotland to lift the trophy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plissken
There’s going to be a lot of talent, so I predict a lot of cheering (please!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USA for the win, Canada/England for second and third and I think Scotland defiantly have the potential to better the last world cup position, it’s a very strong team!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge thank you to Mathieson, Morris and Plissken for taking the time to answer my many, many questions.
Wishing Power of Scotland all the luck!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>4nations</category><category>articles</category><category>granite city brawlermen</category><category>interviews</category><category>men's roller derby</category><category>power of scotland</category><category>roller derby world cup calgary 2016</category><category>super smash brollers</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/11/27/getting-to-know-power-of-scotland/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2015 11:48:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Capital City Host the Final SMRDN game of 2015</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/08/27/capital-city-host-the-final-smrdn-game-of-2015/</link><dc:creator>despicablev</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year we saw the launch of the Scottish Men's Roller Derby Nationals (SMRDN), which saw Bairn City Rollers, Mean City and Capital City all fight for the bragging rights of being the top Scottish Men's team. With two games played and two wins to BCR's Skelpies they have taken the title of champions for this year. There is however still one more game left to play which is sure to be an exciting clash for more than one reason, which is Capital City vs Mean City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/920630431323750/"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone wp-image-4863 size-large" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/08/ccrd-banner-smrdfin.jpg?w=614" alt="ccrd-banner-smrdfin" width="614" height="227"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two teams have yet to met on track in a public game, with this their first encounter deciding who will take second place in this years SMRDN and the looser picking up 3rd and last place for 2015. With so much to play for, both teams will be fighting for every point from the first whistle to the last. And if this wasn't enough to tempt you along, Capital City have turned the event into a double header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get everyone ready for the main event, they are putting on a coed game first at which we will get to see some of the the Granite City Brawlermen in action for the first time as they join forces with some of the girls from Granite City Roller Girls as well as other guys and girls from the likes of Capital City, Mean City and Bairn City to form both of the coed teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This double header will take place at Meddowbank on Saturday the 19th of September, for more information visit the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/920630431323750/"&gt;event page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

At first many thought it was a new men’s league in Scotland, but it is something much more exciting for the Men’s leagues and derby in Scotland. Due to the confusion of it being a league, they have since changed their name to the &lt;a title="Scottish Mens Roler Derby Nationals" href="https://www.facebook.com/SMRDN"&gt;Scottish Men's Roller Derby (SMRD) Nationals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you will know In 2015 we will see some of the women's leagues in Scotland taking part in the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BritishRollerDerbyChamps"&gt;British Championships&lt;/a&gt; which will pull together leagues fom all over the UK playing against each other in regional/level based groups. In essence this is what the the SMRDN is about, but on a smaller scale. Bringing together all the Scottish mens leagues (Bairn City Rollers, Capital City, Granite City Brawlermen and Mean City) to play each other over the course of the year, tracking scores and wins and providing a winner with the most points at the end of the year. For the first season (2015) there will only be three leagues competing (Bairn City Rollers, Capital City and Mean City) with Granite City Brawlermen working hard to put together a team for 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/01/1549327_613471468758290_2453333471572179977_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-4514 size-large" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/01/1549327_613471468758290_2453333471572179977_n.jpg?w=614" alt="1549327_613471468758290_2453333471572179977_n" width="614" height="215"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; All the Scottish Men's Derby Leagues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For well over a year now, all four of the men's leagues in Scotland have been in discussion about putting together the SMRDN. As they knew that they would all be playing each other regularly and were looking for a way in which to make it more interesting for spectators and fans of the leagues.  With this in mind they knew that crowning a league the champion of Scottish Men’s roller derby for a year could help to promote the bouts and give everyone something to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How it will work:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The 2015 Season will see three teams play each other once during the year&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 points will be awarded for each game won and 0 for a loss&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Points Scored (PS), Points Against (PA) and Points Difference (PD) will be tracked over the year&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each league will host 1 home game&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Games will be played to latest MRDA ruleset&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Teams must not field "guest" skaters, all skater must be a full member of their respective league&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The season table will be updated on SMRDN facebook page for all to track see after each game&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Team with the most points at the end of the year will win that season&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
However, if at the end of the season there is a draw of points between teams, then PD will be compared. If the PD is also a draw, the team with the  highest PS will be chosen as the winner of the season.
&lt;p&gt;They have also announced the first game of the 2015 Season and the first game ever of the SMRDN which will see Bairn City Roller host Capital City on the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1528686777405809/%20"&gt;28th of February at Grangemouth Sport Complex&lt;/a&gt; in whats is bound to be a great bot to start this exciting new championship between all the Scottish Men’s Derby Leagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>annoucements</category><category>articles</category><category>bairn city rollers</category><category>capital city roller derby</category><category>granite city brawlermen</category><category>in the news</category><category>mean city roller derby</category><category>men's roller derby</category><category>scottish men's roller derby league</category><category>scottish men's roller derby nationals</category><category>smrdn</category><category>tournament</category><category>upcoming bouts</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/01/10/a-run-down-on-the-scottish-mens-roller-derby-nationals/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2015 22:20:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Granite City Brawlermen - A Roundup of 2014</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/12/31/granite-city-brawlermen-a-roundup-of-2014/</link><dc:creator>caleykapowski</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had a little chat with the wonderful Orion Packs (aka Edd Chandler) at the Granite City Brawlermen have made this year&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has recruitment for the Brawlermen gone in 2014? There has been quite a few new members, have you had to separate training?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had 2 recruitment sessions in 2014 and are looking to hold our next one in the spring of 2015 (likely some time in April)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a couple of our members moving away, our membership has almost doubled since our first intake all those months ago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We train for 2 hours on a Sunday at the moment. Skaters from other leagues are welcome (pay to skate rates would apply), all we ask is that they contact us in advance so that our coaches can have the final say.  For now, all levels of skater attend this session and we cover as much as we can either as a whole or in separate groups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/brawlermen.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-4484 size-full" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/brawlermen.jpg" alt="brawlermen" width="604" height="731"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Granite City Brawlermen official logo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aberdeen is quite far away from other men's leagues, how much opportunity have you had to scrimmage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of our skaters have been to Dundee for their open scrims and we'd like to thank the folks at DRG for hosting and inviting us down.  Some have also visited Grangemouth on a couple of occasions to take part in the open Power of Scotland training sessions and 2 took part in the Team Scotland bootcamp prior to the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few of us have been lucky enough to take part in coed scrims with Granite City Roller Girls.  The girls know that scrimmaging opportunities for us are limited so they invited our mins passed skaters along.  In return, we brought as many members as possible with us to support with NSO'ing etc.  We can't thank GCRG enough for all their support so far. The experience gained by taking part in those sessions is invaluable to our progress as a league&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about the Brawlermen's plans for 2015, so many people are eager to hear if you have any bouts planned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't have any bout plans for 2015 as our main aim is getting our current crop through their minimums and into scrimmages if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main focus is getting our skaters through their minimum skills assessments and scrimmaging whenever/wherever they can.  We also want to grow awareness of roller derby as a whole in the north east AND we will be helping with the organisation of the new Scottish Men's Roller Derby League with the overall aim being to eventually take part!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're always looking for new ways to grow and progress so although you may not see us on track, we can guarantee that 2015 will be another year of positive growth and development for GCB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>granite city brawlermen</category><category>interviews</category><category>men's roller derby</category><category>review of the year</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/12/31/granite-city-brawlermen-a-roundup-of-2014/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2014 10:00:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Granite City Roller Girls &amp; Granite City Brawlermen Recruitment Day</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/08/22/granite-city-roller-girls-and-granite-city-brawlermen-recruitment-day/</link><dc:creator>caleykapowski</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/08/gcrg-recruits-6-september-2014.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone  wp-image-3611" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/08/gcrg-recruits-6-september-2014.jpg?w=212" alt="GCRG recruits 6 September 2014" width="212" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/08/gcb-recruitment-6-september-2014.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3612" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/08/gcb-recruitment-6-september-2014.jpg?w=212" alt="GCB recruitment 6 September 2014" width="212" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granite City Roller Girls and Granite City Brawlermen are recruiting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday 6th September is an exciting day for Roller Derby Recruitment in Aberdeen with not one but two intakes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, Granite City Roller Girls are holding their intake day at Aberdeen Lads Club (Dill Road) from 11:00-13:00. Then from 13.30 to 15.30 the Brawlermen will be welcoming new recruits as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both GCRG and GCB have experienced coaches who can teach people of all levels so no skating experience is necessary and we can provide equipment - please drop us a message on Facebook to let us know what shoe size you take so we can make sure we have skates for you on the day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCRG are also on the lookout for referees so any ladies or gents who would like to get involved with this aspect of the sport should pop along too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roller Derby is a brilliant way to get fit and meet new people! All we ask is that you’re over 18 years old, wear non restrictive clothing and bring plenty of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put on some skates, be your own hero!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information please email newrecruits@granitecityrollergirls.org.uk or granitecitybrawlermen@gmail.com&lt;/p&gt;

As yet they have no logo, but I am sure an appropriately manly and fishing-related artpiece can be only days away...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting things off to a flying start, the Brawlermen will be hosting a "Learn about Derby" session at The Garage, 17 Windmill Brae, on the 11th of October. This is intended for people new to derby who want to find out what it's all about, and will apparently feature some bout footage from previous mens derby bouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to collect all their new recruits, the first fresh meat session will be on the 9th of November, appropriately at Aberdeen Lads Club in Tillydrone.&lt;/p&gt;
