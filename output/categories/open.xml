(We've seen at least three versions of this topic raised in the last couple of months...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, one of the most common answers is: "we use Facebook because getting people to use something else is really hard".
This is true, of course: Facebook's entire raison d'etre is selling access to its community to advertisers, so it's extremely good at finding ways to stop that community leaving it. The problem is that Facebook is also fairly terrible at being a system for managing a league - finding things which didn't happen in the last few days is very hard, and there's few good tools for decision making or project planning.  Additionally, Facebook's policy decisions, in general, are at the whims of their management; the history of Facebook's changes to its social content to improve the advertising revenue, at the cost of service to the user community, is telling.
Facebook Events &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a pretty good solution for promoting public events - and they're &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than the features in most other social networking sites - but only if your target audience is also on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's the other part of the rub: despite Facebook's best efforts, not everyone has an account on it. Increasingly, especially younger, people - the people your league wants to recruit to grow - are either using other social networks (Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat), or not using social networks at all (just communication tools like WhatsApp). All social networking services "age out" after a while, and becoming dependant on a particular social network for running your league gives you a built-in sell-by date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we've previously noted, there's a lot of ethical and philosophical overlap between Roller Derby culture - "For the X, by the X", regardless of if "X" is "Skater", "Member", or otherwise - and the various open culture and consensus democracy movements on the Internet. Luckily, those movements also have built a lot of software for helping organise the various issues communities face...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to break down the (software) problems of managing a league (or an NGB, which is really a community of leagues) into a few sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/2/"&gt;Project Management&lt;/a&gt; (page 2) - the core aspect of running any community with goals - managing who is responsible for them, and how things are going.
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/3/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consensus decision making&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (page 3)  - making decisions that your community can own.
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/4/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-time &lt;em&gt;Communication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (page 4) - bringing your community into contact with each other, transparently, in discussion.
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/5/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event &lt;em&gt;Calendaring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (page 5) - keeping track of time, especially to promote your events to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not going to talk about "sports club" specific software here, although it does exist. Mostly those tools cover the items on page 2 - Project Management - with a sports-themed emphasis.
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Community Task Management : Taiga, Podio&lt;/h3&gt;
The most important thing that a community with tasks to accomplish needs is a way to track and manage all the responsibilities for making those tasks happen. This is such a common requirement for any community - be it a sporting group, a software development team, a newspaper or a political party, a FTSE100 company... - that there are countless solutions which address this space. Some of these solutions are tied to particular "styles" of project management, and some are more free-form.
&lt;p&gt;As with all of the other solutions in this article, we're going to talk about "hosted" solutions - software which runs on someone else's servers, where they're responsible for all the data you give them - and "self-hosted" solutions - where you run your own service, on servers which you own [this can be actual physical machines, or services in "the cloud"], where you have more control, but also need more technically skilled people to run things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, one of the most popular hosted solutions for project management is &lt;a href="https://podio.com/site/en"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Podio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
As well as project management, Podio tries to be a kitchen-sink solution - also rolling in forums, voting systems and document management - and offers a free trial option (for small teams &amp;lt; 5 members), and a series of paid options (paid per member). We've not used Podio much in anger, but, as with many project management tools with "extras", it seems that the core project management is much better than the things bolted on to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very many free, or open-source solutions in this space as well - open-source communities also need to manage their own tasks, and tend to write their own tools to do so! Out of these options, we currently favour &lt;a href="https://taiga.io/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Taiga is more focussed on the task-management aspect of things (although it does do many of the things Podio offers in addition), and prefers solutions in the "agile development" space, which encourages breaking projects up into rapid, incremental goals to allow a team to adapt to changing circumstances. Taiga offers both hosted solutions (free for public projects, paid per member for private projects), and also supports self-hosting - the source code is completely free, so anyone can run their own Taiga server.
The Taiga team also have a handy guide to project management, and Taiga, here: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://taiga.pm/"&gt;https://taiga.pm/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiga and Podio both offer mobile-phone Apps for phone-friendly access, as well as the desktop friendly web interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other good solutions, depending on the Project Management paradigm you like, include Trello and Wrike (both hosted services), and Orchard Collaboration (an open-source, self-hosted solution). There are also several app-only services aimed specifically at running sports clubs, but these seem to be vexingly limited and are usually pay-only. One of the best of the sports club solutions seems to be &lt;a href="https://teamstuff.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TeamStuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which, despite being a hosted closed-source solution, does have a free option with most of the features you'd want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Community Consensus : Loomio&lt;/h3&gt;
In order to drive your community's priorities, you need to make decisions which involve your whole community. Hierarchical cultures will make decisions from "on top", whilst more open, "democratic", communities will involve the membership in all decisions, from "bottom up".  The project management software from the previous page will often allow for both styles, but tend to focus on adversarial voting systems to do "democracy".
&lt;p&gt;Generally,  the best approaches to community decision making tend to be Consensus, not direct voting; approaches whereby the community &lt;em&gt;negotiates&lt;/em&gt; a mutually acceptable solution for any given problem, collaboratively, rather than adversarially.
Consensus approaches for government are pretty widespread in many cultures in the world, from the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) through to the Religious Society of Friends (the Quakers). They've not caught on as much in Western-style mainstream politics, where adversarial voting systems are more common, and the "minority loses absolutely" mindset can be difficult to shake, even when relatively minor compromises could improve solutions for everyone. Majority votes easily split communities, and can be a big source of frustrations and feelings of disenfranchisement for those in the minority (especially if that minority is large, or if the "majority" is less than 50% itself)*.
We know that many leagues adopt consensus style systems to make decisions - but many also don't, and it's definitely worth considering them if your league uses adversarial voting and has strong tensions due to minority votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use software to help you make decisions by consensus, then you will probably need to use a separate service to your project management solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-26483" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-07-at-22-14-22.png?w=899" alt="Loomio Example" width="899" height="1024"&gt; An example proposal, responses, and the top of its discussion thread from Loomio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best Consensus decision-making application we're aware of is &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loomio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
A product of the Occupy movement, and run by a self-owned community, Loomio provides both a hosted option (you can sign up for accounts on the Loomio website and use it right away, with free and paid options - including a very discounted paid option for non-profits), and also options for hosting your own copy on your own servers (the code is, of course, entirely open-source, and therefore compatible with the community spirit of roller derby). Loomio has become increasingly widely-used by communities at all scale, even national governments - the &lt;a href="http://blog.loomio.org/2016/05/16/national_assembly_wales/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welsh Assembly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loomio also provides mobile-phone friendly interfaces to allow you to interact easily on whatever device you have, although there's no "App" per se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You can read about how the Loomio Collective embodies the same spirit as Roller Derby does, and the way they structure themselves to support this in their freely available handbook: &lt;a href="https://loomio.coop/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://loomio.coop/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , and read their free, and open-source guide to Consensus and Facilitation here: &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.school/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://www.loomio.school/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*This is as true in countries as it is in smaller communities - we're sure readers can point at several contentious political decisions in the recent past where "narrow victories" led to the absolute acceptance of the "winning" position with no compromise, and resulting anger from all sides.
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Community Communication : Mattermost, Riot.IM&lt;/h3&gt;
Every community benefits from a place to just, well, communicate. Whilst Loomio, and project management tools, all provide a way to discuss things, modern communities are used to freeform, rapid, social messaging. (Ironically, this also used to be the case with earlier internet cultures, who used IRC for precisely this, so this is something of a re-invention of an old concept.) Having one of these communication services absolutely is not a replacement for a proper decision making system, or a project management tool - for the same reason that Facebook is awful for project management: finding things in a long, stream of consciousness history, 6 months later, is almost impossible. However, rapid communication is definitely essential "in the moment", and to bind together your other services with your community itself.
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the current "mainstream" solution for real-time comms seems to be &lt;strong&gt;Slack&lt;/strong&gt;, that product has several limitations which make it less than ideal for large volunteer communities. For a start, Slack is closed-source; and there's no way to run your own separate version of the service - all your data is on Slack's servers, and subject to Slack's rules.
Additionally, the balance of features between the Free and Paid tiers of service is not particularly good, especially regarding retention of logs - it's very easy to hit the "max 10,000" messages limit and then start losing your league's history of communication.
Finally, because of that very closed-source, hosted-only solution, Slack has the balance of power in your relationship with it - very recently, they've started&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://opkode.com/blog/slacks-bait-and-switch/"&gt;turning off features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which allow you more flexibility in using their service, as part of the usual pattern to achieve vendor lock-in in the tech industry. Having to rely on your service being a good-guy, all the time, is not a good place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the open-source movement has our backs, and there are many alternatives to Slack which are just as good, if not better, ethically and performance-wise. We will only mention two here, as examples of the rest of the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.mattermost.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mattermost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provide a Slack-like series of options (free, paid, and "even more expensive paid"), but you need to &lt;em&gt;host&lt;/em&gt; your own server running the software. Of course, the free version of Mattermost is open-source, and does not have most of the limits of the free version of Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.riot.im/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riot.IM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provide a hosted solution which is currently totally free for every feature (they are planning paid hosted options, but it's been a year without any appearing); they're also a completely open-source solution which you can host yourself. [Technically, Riot.IM is a front-end to a messaging system called Matrix, which is also open-source and free.] At present, the "free" Riot.IM hosted instance seems to be having some performance problems, but we believe that this is temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-26484" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-07-at-22-22-36.png?w=1024" alt="Riot.IM" width="1024" height="1009"&gt; A test room in Riot.IM (all of these chat systems look near identical, and much like chat systems always have done since the 1990s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Mattermost and Riot.IM support Slack-compatible "integrations" - allowing your Loomio consensus discussions, and your project management tool, to send notifications and messages to your chat rooms, reminding your community of decisions to be made, or tasks which need to be performed. (The Loomio integration even lets you respond directly from the notification!) With both sets of integrations turned on, your chat channel can be the social "glue" which binds your decision making and your project management together.
Mattermost and Riot.IM also both offer mobile Apps for phone-friendly access, which are just as good as Slack's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Mattermost and Riot.IM (and other alternatives like RocketChat etc) are both open-source, and provide self-hosting solutions, they are very unlikely to try (or succeed at) the same vendor-lock-in approaches which Slack is currently attempting. We'd strongly recommend that leagues look at any of the Slack alternatives with open-source options just for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Community Event Calendaring: Google Calendar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final thing that any league needs is a way to keep track of events, and to promote the public ones to the world. This is really two problems: a calendar, and "social media suite".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, promoting public events is something that Facebook itself is actually fairly good at, as we mentioned at the start of the article - as long as your community is all on the platform (which they increasingly are not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more open-access calendaring and event promotion, there are relatively few truly "open" services. The problem with "promotion" is, of course, that you do need an audience and a way to push your things at them. In the past, this was handled by common services - like RSS - which could be "subscribed" to by interested people, who would then get updates. In the present, your calendaring service needs to be able to be promoted on all your social media platforms, which (given the increasing fragmentation of the market) is much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One &lt;em&gt;hosted&lt;/em&gt; service which does work pretty well for this - and has less lock-in than Facebook - is &lt;a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Obviously, Google is not the most "grass-roots" of providers - and they have a disappointing track record in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Discontinued_Google_services"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;turning off services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at little notice. However, their Calendaring service is one of the more used of their core products, so it's a slightly safer bet for longevity than some of their other products. Google Calendar is also used as the "backend" for many other applications which manage schedules and events for users.
In itself, Google Calendar handles the calendar part of things pretty well, and for free (Google, like Facebook, get money from having data about you, and pushing ads at you). A Google Calendar event is inherently public, and can be linked to by you from anywhere, without the viewers needing a login.
&lt;a href="https://zapier.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zapier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IFTTT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the two most popular "app automation services", fully support the "social media" side of things - they can be set up to automatically share a public calendar event on any and all social media platforms you have logins for. (They also have integrations for Mattermost to post things in your public chat, and several of the Project Management applications - like Trello and Wrike - can add things to a Google Calendar for you automatically.))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the other side of things, there are a whole suite of applications to share things across social media with the click of a button, most of which are paid, hosted services - ranging from the relatively affordable (Loomly, Hootsuite, etc), to the ridiculously expensive and "professional" (Kapost, Percolate and others). The more expensive of these offer huge ranges of services to schedule promotional posts across whole suites of social media profiles and platforms... your league probably already has their social media team using whatever their favourite tool is (and it's probably Hootsuite). Most of these can integrate with a lot of the tools from earlier sections (including your communication service), and can draw items from Google Calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the technically minded people in your league, we'd actually recommend &lt;strong&gt;hosting your calendar yourselves&lt;/strong&gt; on your website, and linking people there across all your social media accounts. (You can make Facebook Events and Google Calendar entries to match it, of course, but owning your data on your website gives you more control and freedom).  If you do this, please do turn on the RSS (or Atom) feed, as it's a very cheap and open way to provide updates to your schedule for anyone who wants to subscribe.* This also frees you from needing to rely on third-party services like Zapier, as you can push your social media notifications directly from your server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Our weekly event roundups for the world mostly draw from Facebook Events as a pragmatic acceptance that that's where leagues advertise things [and we prefer that to the growing trend of leagues just posting an flyer on Instagram, which doesn't help syndication at all].... but being able to subscribe to RSS feeds would also make our lives easier ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;BONUS: Community Forums: Discourse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we've covered the most popular modern means of communication in the &lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/4/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-time &lt;em&gt;Communication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; section, some leagues may also want to host a more static discussion.
Whilst project management software, and Loomio, provide discussion threads as part of their service, there can be some benefits to running a separate Forum, in addition to your real-time discussion rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, you will want to self-host your own forum software, as the hosted services are not that great. There is a wide range of, mostly open-source, forum software to choose from, and our recommendation here does not mean you shouldn't go for one of the alternatives.
However, since we have to recommend at least one solution for each topic, we will be suggesting &lt;a href="https://www.discourse.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discourse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Discourse is, unlike most of the other forum software, written in Ruby, and has a very responsive Javascript powered interface. Whilst overuse of Javascript in webpages is definitely a security issue in itself, Discourse benefits significantly in usability compared to older forum software which has a less responsive design.
Discourse also offer a hosted solution, although it's rather expensive ($100 a month!). We'd definitely recommend using their container-based self-hosting solution in preference to this, just for the cost-saving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In common with the software in many of the other section, Discourse also provides a number of "integrations" with other services - a chat integration so your real-time chat can be notified of new topics, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern Roller Derby is a product of, and inescapably shaped by, the Internet, as is much of culture produced since the mid-1990s. Whilst this has positive effects, it also can have profoundly negative ones, especially regarding the transient and ephemeral nature of our cultural records and history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of time, records have been made with physical marks (scratches in clay, ink on paper, papyrus or animal skin, and so on; or even the physical structure of vinyl records or CDs), and mostly permanently. Secret physical records are kept secret by locking them in a safe, rarely by encrypting or enciphering them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As information technology became more prevalent, over the 20th century, and predominant over the early 21st, more and more of our records - which are our history for future generations (or even ourselves a few years later) - have no physical, human-readable representation. Documents, and photos, and forum posts, are patterns of bytes on a server which we often don't even own, or have direct access to. &lt;em&gt;Secret&lt;/em&gt; documents are encrypted patterns of bytes on a server we don't own, and are completely unreadable if the key to decrypt them is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, it is now much harder to maintain a historical record of the recent past - the recent culture - than it was even two decades ago. This worrying phenomenon is sometimes referred to as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_dark_age"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Dark Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , and we should be more concerned about it than we are. In previous periods, some level of archiving and historical preservation happened "for free" - if you don't deliberately destroy a piece of paper, it will last a fairly long time. In the modern period, records from that old forum your league had before you updated are &lt;em&gt;gone forever&lt;/em&gt; unless you deliberately copied them and saved them elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roller Derby's entire modern culture is stored mostly on electronic documents - there are very few physical artefacts, outside of bout programmes, to cover the history of the sport. (It's also important to preserve those physical artefacts - and projects like the UK-based &lt;a href="http://nmrd.org.uk/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Museum of Roller Derby&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are working on that.)
We currently have volunteer-run operations preserving some statistical records, for example, &lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat Track Stats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an open repository of all the bout scores, and bout stats, uploaded to it, and this is a &lt;em&gt;more important&lt;/em&gt; social and cultural role than the ratings and rankings it produces for subsets of those stats. However, these are both volunteer-run, and patchy in their coverage: for various reasons&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/09/the-vanishing-history-of-roller-derby/#footnotes"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, much of Latin America ignores FTS and does not upload their records there, so we don't even have a good historical record for &lt;em&gt;games&lt;/em&gt; in Latin America (Mexico maintains its own website for game results, which does not sync with FTS, for some reason).
Similarly, &lt;a href="http://derbylisting.com/word/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derbylisting.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; attempts to record the status of leagues across the world, but is also very much dependant on engagement by leagues and the community itself. (And it's not clear to us how well it records historical changes.) There are also several other sites which have tried/are trying to do a similar thing - &lt;a href="https://derbyposition.com/en/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;derbyposition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and fragmentation of effort here makes things much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/09/the-vanishing-history-of-roller-derby/2/"&gt;In the next page, we'll talk about the harder problem of recording our shared cultural heritage - the stories of Roller Derby.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="footnotes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;*The most important reasons being lack of volunteer effort in some regions, because:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;FTS still talks about, and displays, mostly WFTDA branding on itself, even though it takes records from all flat-track derby, not just WFTDA-member, or even WFTDA-rules, leagues (the MRDA branding, which it also has, is not visible on the front page - and &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; WFTDA is actually mentioned in the site's description of itself). Several leagues we've talked to in the past were under the impression that they simply couldn't use FTS if they weren't WFTDA members, or if they were, they couldn't use it for anything but their A teams.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;FTS doesn't have a rating or ranking scheme for Latin America. FTS's popularity in Europe is driven by (ironically, in contrast to the above) the fact that it provides a ranking and rating for all European teams, regardless of their WFTDA membership or if they're an A or B (or even C) team. This is the carrot part of the FTS system, and it simply doesn't exist (officially) for Latin America.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 Strictly, it does, as &lt;a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRank.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SRDRank&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a rating and ranking system for the entire world, using FTS's records; but we're not anywhere near as visible as FTS, and we are acutely aware that the SRDRank site needs updates after resources devoted to it were diverted to the Roller Derby World Cup for several months. Lack of resources is a problem everywhere, sadly.
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recording Culture and Stories&lt;/h3&gt;
Statistics are easy to record.The situation for more complex cultural records - forum posts, discussion threads, the entire contents of online magazines or journals - is both more subtle, and also more difficult to resolve. Members of the Roller Derby community who joined post-2014 may not even recognise the name "DNN" -&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.derbynews.net/"&gt;Derby News Network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but that titan of Roller Derby reporting and bout streaming was a central part of the Roller Derby community for the seven whole years - almost two fifths of the entire time Roller Derby has existed - before it died. We're extremely &lt;em&gt;lucky&lt;/em&gt; that the owners, and community, came together to keep the servers holding the site running - albeit with reduced resources - and to archive its valuable historical records. Because of this effort, we can still, for example, look back at &lt;a href="http://www.derbynews.net/2008/09/09/5_texas_stops_9_detroit_83_46/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;how Texas fared against Detroit back in 2008&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (and their rosters at the time!).
&lt;p&gt;For public sites, there is at least the hope that you can pretend it's someone else's problem - the &lt;a href="https://archive.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exists explicitly to combat the loss of history due to the ephemeral nature of websites by trawling the web and taking archival, historical snapshots of sites it can access. This isn't perfect: the Archive can't check every site every day - or even every site every year; and it tries to focus on the websites with the most interest and links, as they're likely to be the most important. But it does give a certain minimum insurance against total loss - something, albeit possibly a tiny fragment, will possibly survive, even if you don't care to take precautions yourself.
When the next site with a huge chunk of Roller Derby culture dies - and &lt;a href="https://indieweb.org/site-deaths"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sites die all the time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - we may not be so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're taking some steps to combat this, starting with a small thing today: we're working on an archive, to be public, of Roller Derby collective culture - the stories that make up the history of the sport from 2001 onwards - collected from the community itself. You can submit your stories to our Google forms - we have &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFg0uCe1GrSUdv-2VrRU4Sczv_NhIygRZg3UwjjM-AxvIJKQ/viewform?usp=sf_link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;one version in English&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRppNu4hkwlRzofmcD_stFmuYzgM9-ZNW1jK_GWulDzPgagA/viewform?usp=sf_link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;one in Spanish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more accessibility - in any language you want, and about any event in roller derby you can relate. (We're especially interested in making sure we get stories from the early days of the sport before they are lost, and from regions and leagues who aren't often covered... but all stories are welcome.)
In the near future, we'll be talking about how we'll make this archive available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/09/the-vanishing-history-of-roller-derby/3/"&gt;In the next page, we'll talk about the issues recording the history of Roller Derby's governance.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Recording Our Sport's Governance &amp;amp; Transparency&lt;/h3&gt;
Much of the existing Roller Derby cultural history isn't even public - it's in private silos across the internet. The majority of governing bodies in Roller Derby maintain almost entirely private spaces, as do the majority of leagues. (Even when those spaces are not private, the use of restrictive copyright may also inhibit preservation - as several digital archiving projects have discovered; this is another reason why using better, more open licenses - &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or otherwise - enriches the community.)
We can trust that WFTDA, or MRDA, say, keeps a full and complete backup of all of their forum discussions. But we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to trust, because we have no way to have an independent record of any of that contents - both because of technological walls (the forums are private, password-protected spaces), and legal ones (the WFTDA, etc, NDAs prevent public disclosure of those contents by anyone who does have access to them).
This is not to pick on WFTDA alone, as we're hopeful is clear - all Roller Derby governing bodies have this problem to various extents, even when they've committed to more open and transparent communication. For example, UKRDA has made some positive steps towards this - making minutes of Board Meetings &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1387CqPTaHx_dp1JAgoxSrHlnrbC45aBj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;public&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - and have shown interest in working towards further transparency, but they're still working &lt;em&gt;towards&lt;/em&gt; them.
&lt;p&gt;We should note that problems of transparency have dogged many Sports Governing Bodies in the last few years - and &lt;a href="http://www.playthegame.org/news/comments/2016/034_the-rules-of-the-game-the-need-for-transparency-in-sports-governance/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;there are calls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="http://www.playthegame.org/knowledge-bank/downloads/sports-governance-observer-2015/c14e0343-6716-42b5-9aa0-a6c700daeb48"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) from those in the wider sports governance community for all SGBs to become as transparent as other democracies already are. WFTDA&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/09/the-vanishing-history-of-roller-derby/#footnotes2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; does do better than a great many SGBs; but some SGBs are particularly opaque (FIFA comes to mind).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparency is sometimes hard, but it doesn't have to be this way. The British Government, which has not been an exemplar for good transparency over most of its existence, still manages to publish and archive a &lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;completely public record&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of all debates in Parliament&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/09/the-vanishing-history-of-roller-derby/#footnotes3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, since around 1800. This &lt;em&gt;Hansard&lt;/em&gt; system is also used by many other democracies across the World - New Zealand, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Singapore - and other similar systems are used by, for example, the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United States of America &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(in fact, the Constitution of the USA &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; that Congress keep such public records), and the &lt;a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/home.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;European Parliament&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
In all of these cases, these records required a lot of effort to generate - they're hand-stenotyped transcriptions of verbal debates, with post-editing for readability and references - but because they exist, we know much more about the history of those institutions, their culture, and how this changed over time. (And because they're almost all public, copyright-free records, other copies can be made of them, so the risk of them being lost to the world is negligible.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, almost all of the debate in Roller Derby happens online, in text conversations on forums and chat rooms. Making available an "MRDA Hansard", or a "WFTDA Congressional Record" is almost trivial - the data already exists in written form, it just needs to be published somewhere, and with the correct level of access for the community. (We'd argue that if national governments can manage to make their debates Public to the World, it shouldn't be a big deal for any Governing Body of a sport whose founding ethic is "For The Skater, By The Skater").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is obviously a trade-off here between transparency and the right to privacy. All organisations need private spaces - for grievance committees, embargoed information from other sources, and so on - but they need much fewer private spaces than they often create for themselves. Organisations also need to protect the rights of individuals to privacy of personal information - for example, any organisation in Europe needs to comply with the &lt;a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/gdpr-faqs.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GDPR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on this topic - and this will require some secrecy in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also important to note that just because a space is publicly accessible does not mean that it has to be open to public's input - only Members of Parliament may speak in the British House of Commons, but the entire world can see (and hear, nowadays) what they say. In the case of roller derby, Derbylisting.com records around &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1800&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; leagues playing under WFTDA/MRDA rules - even though the majority are not members of either organisation, they do have some moral rights to know what the community has coming for it, in return for the legitimacy they lend the organisations merely by adopting those rules. (Transparency can also be a good way to engage your community in the present, as well as allowing your record to be preserved in the past!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more of our history and community in the public domain (both visible, and licensed to distribute more rights), maintaining our history becomes a shared possibility for the entire roller derby community.
We at the Scottish Roller Derby blog are also looking a hosting some smaller-scale public resources to help encourage transparency and community - we'll be writing more about the technology side of this in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="footnotes3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;*The British Government also, since 2000/2002 commits to making a lot more of its internal documents and records available to the public of the world, via the Freedom of Information Acts (&lt;a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/contents"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - England &amp;amp; Wales, &lt;a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2002/13/contents"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2002&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Scotland), after consultation started in 1997 ("&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/your-right-to-know-the-governments-proposals-for-a-freedom-of-information-act"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Right To Know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"). Many other governments have committed to similar levels of free access to the public - not just their own citizens, but the world; Sweden may hold the record for first raising this issue in 1766!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="footnotes2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**WFTDA deserves credit, for example, for the amount of material it does publish, when out of NDA, on officiating the rules; for making its rating calculations completely public (something MRDA does not do, by contrast); for (albeit without a good interface other than sending an email) making bout stats for all Sanctioned Games available to anyone who asks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>dnn</category><category>in the news</category><category>international</category><category>international derby</category><category>open</category><category>wftda</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/09/the-vanishing-history-of-roller-derby/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 09 Mar 2018 11:59:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Team who Sur5ed: Fierce Valley host Harry Potter-themed open event</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/10/18/the-team-who-sur5ed-fierce-valley-host-harry-potter-themed-open-event/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's now become a tradition that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://fvrg.co.uk"&gt;Fierce Valley Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; host big events towards the end of the year, and this year is no different. After the success of previous Sur5al tournaments, FVRG are adding an additional detail this year: all teams are coed (or "open", as we believe the newly popular term is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;22nd&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;October&lt;/strong&gt; sees this event, with a Harry Potter theme embraced by many of the teams, at Fierce Valley's usual venue of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Grangemouth+Sports+Complex/@56.0117322,-3.7230718,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x488879aaeb85b4ed:0x204ad804f85c6304!8m2!3d56.0117322!4d-3.7208831"&gt;Grangemouth Sports Complex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of Sur5al is that you can host a relatively large number of teams in a surprisingly small space of time, and the Scottish roller derby community have taken full advantage of this, with the following teams signed up to skate:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Golden Snatches&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#ffff00;background-color:#000000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yellow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Dita Von Cheese&lt;/em&gt; [Fierce Valley Roller Girls])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Snapes on a Plane&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#3366ff;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Thump'her&lt;/em&gt; [Fierce Valley Roller Girls])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Slytherwins&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#008000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Fury Eyes Only&lt;/em&gt; [Auld Reekie Roller Girls])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Block Street Boys&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Black&lt;/strong&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Tiny Tearaway&lt;/em&gt; [Dundee Roller Girls])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Neville loves Prada&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#808080;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Khileesi&lt;/em&gt; [Dundee Roller Girls])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Why so Sirius?&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#ff6600;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orange&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Sadie O'Hades&lt;/em&gt; [Glasgow Roller Derby])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Immobulud&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#ffffff;background-color:#000000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Skimbleshanks&lt;/em&gt; [Mean City Roller Derby])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Nameless Ones&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Sylk&lt;/em&gt; [Mean City Roller Derby])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Snitches and Bitches&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#ff00ff;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pink&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Hazzard&lt;/em&gt; [New Town Roller Girls])&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline-block;width:120pt;"&gt;Magic Hot Pocket&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="color:#800080;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Captain: &lt;em&gt;Harm&lt;/em&gt; [Lothian Derby Dolls])&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
With ten teams taking part, the usual Sur5al round robin format will require a massive &lt;em&gt;45&lt;/em&gt; bouts, each lasting a single jam, for a total of 90 minutes of track time (probably approaching 2 hours of total time).
&lt;p&gt;In total, we are told that, in addition to those teams providing captains, skaters from Bairn City Rollers, Ayrshire Roller Derby, Granite City Roller Derby, Granite City Brawlers, and Capital City Roller Derby are also represented, making this a truly inclusive event for the Scottish derby community. (Even the officials are represented, as Block Street Boys Captain Tiny Tearaway is returning to the track from her now usual Refereeing role for this event.)&lt;/p&gt;
