Now’s your chance; Fierce Valley Roller Cubs is looking for guest coaches from the wider world of Scottish roller derby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="  wp-image-1833 aligncenter" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/10/cubs.jpg" alt="cubs" width="291" height="288"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based in Falkirk and training every Sunday, Fierce Valley Roller Cubs is open to all between the ages of 5 and 17, and currently has a range of skaters from beginners to advanced level. Cubs skaters have taken part in several intraleague games, the first of their kind in Scotland, and last year crossed the border to take part in their first external game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="  wp-image-4611 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/04/10744964_366809973478799_46185807_n.jpg" alt="10744964_366809973478799_46185807_n" width="530" height="376"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you could spare a couple of hours to share your knowledge and skills with the next generation of derby players and help take Fierce Valley Roller Cubs to the next level, please get in touch for more information: cubs@fiercevalleyrollercubs.co.uk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fierce Valley Roller Cubs was the first junior roller derby league in Scotland, and began training in September 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>fierce valley roller cubs</category><category>fvrc</category><category>junior roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/04/04/fierce-valley-roller-cubs-needs-you/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2017 10:47:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Cubs Take On New Opposition</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/10/07/cubs-take-on-new-opposition/</link><dc:creator>camelondiaz</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Fierce Valley Roller Cubs celebrated their third birthday, and on Sunday October 9th, they will play their first game against other junior skaters. This mixed junior game will take place as part of a triple header hosted by Barnsley Black Heart Rollers and will feature skaters from Sheffield Steel Junior Rollers and Newcastle Junior Roller Derby League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9210" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/13880228_1012374508875985_648255813429450617_n.jpg" alt="13880228_1012374508875985_648255813429450617_n" width="784" height="295"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cubs will be sending thirteen level 3 and advanced skaters to take part, some of whom will be playing in public for the first time, while others are veterans of several intraleagues. Needless to say, the level of excitement is high and the bus journey to Barnsley at 6.30am on Sunday promises to be a lively one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last word (as always), goes to the Cubs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s great to finally play against people that aren't in our own team. As good as it is to have bouts amongst our own team this bout against a different team gives a chance to see how well we are progressing. I'm really excited for the road trip and can't wait to get out on track” – Vanilla Crush.
“I am really happy and excited that we are getting to meet another junior team and play against them” – Lu Dog Millionaire.
“It’s not often that I see 6.30am at the weekend, the long journey will be worth it though, are we there yet?” – Purple Punisher.
“I am super chuffed to be captaining our first away game, it will be an eye opener for all involved I am sure” – Stunami.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4611" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/04/10744964_366809973478799_46185807_n.jpg" alt="10744964_366809973478799_46185807_n" width="960" height="681"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FVRC welcomes boys and girls aged 5-17, with no previous skating experience necessary.  We can provide kit to borrow for the session, with the exception of a mouthguard and helmet, so there is no commitment.  The taster will cover basic skating skills, most importantly, how to stop and fall safely!&lt;/p&gt;

With three fresh meat intakes throughout the year, skater numbers have grown to around thirty 5-17 year olds regularly attending training, across three skill levels. We have retained a large number of skaters from our first few intakes, meaning that at the moment, the majority of our members are level three skaters, although a successful taster session at the start of December should help to boost numbers in levels one and two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/12/cubs2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5271"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone  wp-image-5271 aligncenter" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/12/cubs2.jpg?w=300" alt="cubs2" width="420" height="280"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
This year, Fierce Valley Roller Cubs were invited by three different leagues – Bairn City Rollers, Dundee Roller Girls and Fierce Valley Roller Girls – to take part in double headers. The game in Dundee marked the first time the Cubs played away from Grangemouth – the Cubs word is spreading far and wide! Several newer skaters played for the first time in public at one of these games this year, and all loved the experience. From a coaching point of view, it’s always satisfying to see everything we work on in training come together in a game.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/12/cubs1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5270"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone  wp-image-5270" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/12/cubs1.jpg?w=300" alt="cubs1" width="348" height="232"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year also saw some changes to the way we structure our training, due to a change in the JRDA minimum skills, which brought them almost in line with WFTDA’s mins. This meant that our advanced skaters, i.e. those that had passed the “old” level three, had to work towards the new skills. Despite a step up in skill level and difficulty, all of our skaters worked hard and we already have quite a number who have passed the new level three.
For 2016, our goal is to play against another junior team, which has proved difficult so far due to the lack of other juniors. Fierce Valley Roller Cubs is almost unique in being both co-ed and open to kids as young as five, with most others being either female only, aimed at teenagers, or both. We are ever hopeful that the growth in junior roller derby will produce plenty of opponents for us!
The last words go to a Cub, Hayley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long have you been part of Cubs, and why did you get involved?&lt;/strong&gt;
I've been involved with the Cubs for just over a year now. Like many I first found out about roller derby after watching Whip It, and I quickly became obsessed with the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the Cubs were still in the process of setting up and I went to see my first game in Edinburgh, which made me want to play even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended missing the Cubs starting as i was busy with school and the idea of playing derby slipped my mind, until my dad suggested I see if a junior team had started yet. I then found out that the Cubs had started up and were the only junior team in Scotland, and that they were holding a freshmeat intake in the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really nervous about joining, despite having bought skates a few years back when I had first found derby and getting a bit of practice in. At the taster session I fell and ended up having to get carried out by my dad and I went to the hospital the next day, thankfully nothing was broken (I did however end up with biggest bruise of my life), and from then on I was absolutely hooked on derby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has your involvement in Cubs changed this year?&lt;/strong&gt;
This year I have been helping out at the Sunday sessions for level 1 and 2 skaters as an on skates helper. In doing so my own skating skills have improved, as I've been able to spend more time on skates, but I've also been able to see our fresh meat getting better and more confident at skating and help them develop into great skaters. I've been able to use this volunteer experience to help with my university application and I'm incredibly grateful to all the coaches at the Cubs for this, as skating has given me skills that I can use in other aspects of my life, such as perseverance and commitment, as well as strengthening my confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your biggest achievement this year?&lt;/strong&gt;
My biggest achievement has been passing level 3 for the second time, after the requirements were changed to be closer to WFTDA's minimum skills, which included the dreaded 27 laps in 5 minutes. When I first started skating I thought there was no way I could ever skate that fast or be able to do things like transitions and backwards skating. This year I've really seen myself improve, going from fresh meat at the end of 2014 to advanced now. I've also played in two games this year, including my first game ever, which were also a big achievement. Although both times my team lost, it was amazing to see everyone working together and trying their absolute hardest, no matter what position they were playing. I'm sure anyone that was in attendance will say our last game of the year was an incredibly tense and well fought game, with a lead change of 2 points in the last jam!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/12/cubs3.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5272"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-5272 aligncenter" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/12/cubs3.jpg?w=300" alt="cubs3" width="357" height="238"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hayley jamming in her first game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And what was the most memorable thing you did as part of Cubs?&lt;/strong&gt;
Taking part in my first ever game has to be the most memorable and terrifying thing I've done with the Cubs. I was so nervous before and couldn't imagine myself jamming and definitely not getting lead jammer and picking up points for the team. Although I was shaking before I felt great afterwards. I was incredibly proud of myself and my team for working so hard. I was also proud of the skaters on the other team for putting up such a good fight and playing so well. The second game I played in this year was also memorable as I could see just how much myself and the other skaters had improved in only a few months, as I found that we were playing together as a team much better, by playing offensively to help our jammers and using techniques such as star passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would you like to see in 2016 for FVRC?&lt;/strong&gt;
Unfortunately I won't be with the Cubs for all of 2016 as I'll be turning 18, but I would love to see the Cubs playing other junior teams and continuing to grow in numbers and talent. As there are more junior derby teams starting up in the uk I think 2016 will be a great year for the Cubs to hopefully get to show off all the hard work that the skaters and coaches have put in. I hope that even once I've left I'll be able to come back and support the Cubs, and see the young skaters I've trained with continue to get better and better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fierce Valley Roller Cubs is the only junior roller derby league in Scotland and one of only a handful in the UK. From the first training session in September 2013, the league has grown to over 30 skaters over four levels, and has recently played a third public game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fierce valley roller cubs</category><category>fresh meat</category><category>fvrc</category><category>junior roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/07/24/fierce-valley-roller-cubs-new-skater-intake-2/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2015 10:54:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Fierce Valley Roller Cubs New Skater Intake</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/04/14/fierce-valley-roller-cubs-new-skater-intake/</link><dc:creator>camelondiaz</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fierce Valley Roller Cubs are recruiting!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/cubsrev3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="  wp-image-4418 aligncenter" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/cubsrev3.jpg?w=300" alt="cubsrev3" width="482" height="321"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year began with an intake of skaters in January, and the interest in junior derby has remained high enough to hold a further three intakes throughout the year. As of the end of 2014, FVRC currently has around forty skaters from across Central Scotland regularly attending at least one of our three sessions per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014 was also a year of learning and adapting, not only for the young skaters but for the coaches too. When we found that a number of Cubs were passing their level one and level two assessments (taken from the JRDA), it became clear that two sessions on a Sunday would not be enough so a third session, for skaters aiming to pass level three, and focussing more on derby skills and gameplay, was added on a Friday evening. We also took the decision to have all skaters at the same level train together regardless of age rather than splitting them into two groups of 5-10 and 11-17 year olds. This has worked very well to this point and has helped kids of all ages to progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first major milestone of 2014 came at the end of May, when Fierce Valley Roller Cubs were invited by ARRG to stage a demonstration at half time in one of their games. Despite some initial nerves, the Cubs were thrilled to have the opportunity to show off their skills in front of a large crowd at Meadowbank, and it was a proud moment for the coaches too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this, July saw a week-long derby summer school held, which started with a taster session and included sessions from guest coaches from Power of Scotland and FVRG. The summer school was well-attended and popular with the Cubs, and is something we will look to repeat in summer 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culmination of the summer school, not to mention the months of hard work beforehand, was FVRC hosting the first ever public junior derby game in Scotland. Two teams of advanced Cubs skaters faced off in front of a large crowd in Grangemouth, and it was great to see the level of support from the wider derby community for our event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/cubsrev1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="  wp-image-4419 aligncenter" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/cubsrev1.jpg?w=300" alt="cubsrev1" width="443" height="295"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As word of the Cubs spreads, we have been asked to visit schools and other groups to demonstrate what junior roller derby involves. Another demonstration scrimmage at half time in Capital City’s debut bout followed and brought us to the attention of a wider audience still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014 was rounded off with another game, this time as part of a Harry Potter-themed double-header with Fierce Valley Roller Girls. With more skaters involved, a number of whom who have now passed their level three assessments, the progression in skills, tactics and derby knowledge was apparent in a closely fought game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Away from the track, we set up a Parents’ Committee which has been a great help to us in organising events including a family fun day, Halloween party and Christmas roller disco. In this way, we’ve seen that roller derby is something that whole families can become involved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, 2014 has been hugely successful for Fierce Valley Roller Cubs – 2015 has a lot to live up to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last word on 2014 goes to Teeny Bash, who has taken part in every event this year and captained Team Ravenclaw in the second Cubs game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/cubsrev2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-medium wp-image-4420 alignleft" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/cubsrev2.jpg?w=300" alt="cubsrev2" width="300" height="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;14 was a busy year for FVRC, what will you remember most about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will remember my first bout because it was the most exciting day ever. I couldn't sleep the night before and all I could think about was how it would feel to do the skate out that I have watched the roller girls do. My mum took me to watch a FVRG bout and I just wanted it to be me out there skating. I said one day I am going to make that team. That's my goal but I have to wait a whole 7 years, boo. :-(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FVRC made their public debut at an ARRG bout back in May, how did that feel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major butterflies!!! It felt amazing to be out there skating in front of the crowd cheering for the cubs. I felt so proud of being a roller cub that day. I think we showed them what us kids can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And how did it feel to play in the first junior roller derby bout in Scotland?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will never be a first one again and I was there taking part in it. We made roller derby history that day and I was there, yey! I won't ever forget that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did you learn this year, and what do you think was your biggest achievement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be good enough to do a double game with the big girls. My biggest achievement was passing my level 3 skills test which means I can now go out and play another team. I can't wait to play another team, and show how good we are getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love love love roller derby!!! I tell everyone I know about roller derby and how great it is. I didn't want to do dancing like all the other girls my age did so was stuck, now I have something I love doing. I can skate and keep fit and enjoy myself. I made a lot of new friends at derby and we all get on with each other. I will never stop skating, ever.&lt;/p&gt;

A year has passed, and many more firsts have been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/08/cubstaster.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3650" src="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/08/cubstaster.jpg?w=300" alt="cubstaster" width="300" height="199"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the official start date was September 2013, the history of the Cubs actually stretches back much further, to around November 2011. A number of obstacles, not least funding, had to be overcome before getting our first intake of kids on skates, but when it finally happened, we were overwhelmed by the level of interest and support that we attracted. Our first two taster sessions were very well attended and a large number of those first Cubs are still with us today. It was as steep a learning curve for the coaches as for the Cubs themselves, working towards JRDA skills and assessments and figuring out how to adapt training plans to suit juniors. As word spread and interest grew, and many of our first batch of recruits passed their level one assessments, we were able to hold another taste session before Christmas and start a new intake in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Cubs kept progressing, passing their level two assessments, it became clear that the four training sessions every Sunday wouldn’t be enough for our growing numbers and increasing skill levels, so a third session, on Friday evenings, was introduced for level three skaters. This session focuses on learning derby as opposed to skating skills, and has proven very popular. More recently, we've stopped splitting level one and two into juniors and seniors so all of our skaters, regardless of age, train together from the beginning.&lt;br&gt; As well as increasing numbers of kids taking part - we had further intakes at Easter and in the summer, we also have a dedicated parents' committee who organise fundraising and social events for the Cubs, the first of which was a successful Easter family fun day. It's great to know that we have a reliable group of supportive parents who are willing to help out in lots of different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the highlights of the first year was being asked to take part in a demonstration scrimmage at half time at an ARRG bout in May. It was a fantastic experience for those who took part to skate at Meadowbank in front of a crowd, and also to meet the skaters afterwards. We're grateful to everyone involved for letting the Cubs be part of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest event in the past year has been, without a doubt, their first public game, which was also the first ever public junior roller derby game played in Scotland. We held a four day summer school in the run up to the game, to finalise those skills and tactics, with guest coaches from FVRG and PoS. We had a great turnout for the day itself and the kids thoroughly enjoyed themselves, showing what they can do. It was fantastic to see the support from the wider derby community and a proud moment for the coaches to see everything coming together on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/08/cubsbout.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3651" src="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/08/cubsbout.jpg?w=300" alt="cubsbout" width="300" height="126"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, it's hard to believe that a year has passed since the first Cubs session, but at the same time, it's difficult to remember a time that the Cubs didn't exist! The past year hasn't been without its challenges but the overwhelming success of the Cubs makes it worthwhile. As coaches, we have learned so much, and we are very lucky to have such a fantastic group of kids to work with. We currently have over forty skaters over three different levels , and each one of them impresses us with their hard work, determination and enthusiasm every time they put on their skaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what's next for Fierce Valley Roller Cubs? We're planning another intake before the end of the year, and - exclusive - their second game. We can't wait to see where the next year will take us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photos courtesy of Claire Brunton of Zenspirations Photography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fierce valley roller cubs</category><category>fvrc</category><category>junior derby</category><category>junior roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/08/31/fierce-valley-roller-cubs-one-year-on/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2014 18:09:03 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
