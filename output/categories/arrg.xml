&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;As the skaters pack away their skates for Christmas Break all I can hear in the distance is the gentle fizz of Cherry Lambrini, ice clinking in Lex Luthor’s Gin and the gentle whir of wheels spinning as my skates get their yearly maintenance. Not to mention the continuing echo of “All I want for Christmas” in my head after Auld Reekie Roller Girls' Christmas scrimmage on Thursday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;We had massive attendance from our Intermediate and our Advanced skaters to take part in this once a year opportunity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The Festive Periods took on the Ba Humbugs in some super fun skating that involved a few Clockwise Jams, Dancing Jams, Singing Jams and even a "Throw your hands in the air like you just don't mind terribly and would only be mildly inconvenienced" Jam. No idea who won, that wasn’t really the goal. We had Pass the Parcel, raffles and some conveniently named officials Ref's for the evening were - The Yule be Sorry &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;and The Prosec-NS-Ho-Ho-Ho's ( You can probably guess who they were), we had 2 Santas, a troupe of elves and a few Grinches who didn't dress up ( Me) . There was more festive cheer than you could shake a candy cane at. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So, with the Year drawing to an end, I thought it an apt moment to conclude the year for ARRG and summarise some of the amazing games and scores from all 3 travel teams this year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Starting with the &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;ALL STARS&lt;/span&gt; (our A- Team) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/node/75175"&gt;12/3/16&lt;/a&gt;    ARRG &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;188&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; - 147 Newcastle RG(A) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;It has been a great year for ARRG, and I think I can speak for everyone when I say we are excited to get stuck into 2017. The New Year brings a fresh Roster selection, New Captains and Vice, New rules to look over and, hopefully, new game prospects and new friends to make. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;From everyone at ARRG we wish you all Merry Festivities and a Happy New Year when it comes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Glasgow and Fierce Valley playing away, the Scottish home games are happening at Auld Reekie's traditional venue, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Meadowbank+Sports+Centre/@55.956622,-3.1585026,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4887b86eb150070f:0x6955a8c9b9a10cc5!8m2!3d55.956619!4d-3.1563086"&gt;Meadowbank Stadium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, doors open at &lt;strong&gt;2:20pm Saturday 11th&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7441" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/06/13235130_10156950736565224_2994993262049877442_o.jpg?w=1024" alt="13235130_10156950736565224_2994993262049877442_o" width="1024" height="385"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading up &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/350352705088707/"&gt;the double-header&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Auld Reekie's All-Stars are taking on Kallio Rolling Rainbow, one of Finland's finest teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After their usual impressive performance at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/03/16/the-big-o-2016-schedule-timezones/"&gt;The Big O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in Oregon, Auld Reekie are riding high, ready for another challenge - Kallio are slightly higher ranked than they are (FlatTrackStats &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/79684/rankings"&gt;predicts a win&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for the Finns, albeit with some uncertainty). This will be a WFTDA Sanctioned bout and contribute to both teams' rankings, so it will be an especially hard-fought contest, as both teams will want to reach Division 1 (or remain in Division 2) of the WFTDA Rankings in order to qualify for Playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other bout is no less exciting in its own way, marking the debut of ARRG's new 'C'-team, the 'All-Star Rookies'&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/06/02/june-11ths-packed-scottish-derby-schedule/#sup"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as they take on Granite City Roller Girls B, the Fight Hawks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, with a team debut, it's hard to make predictions as to the result of the bout; this will be a contest between Auld Reekie's new skater training and the experience gained by the Fight Hawks over the last year. (Having seen some of ARRG's rookies in "rising stars" bouts in the last few months, however, there's some very impressive performers there...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets on the door will be £8 (just £4 per bout), or £5 online via &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2553305"&gt;BrownPaperTickets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Concessions tickets will be just £6 on the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Glasgow Roller Derby are apparently the stars of the show down in Oldham, as Rainy City Roller Derby are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://rainycityrollerderby.com/event/euro-weekender/"&gt;hosting a weekend of derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, in which Glasgow feature in 3 out of 4 bouts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Scotland versus Wales playoff, Glasgow's A team, the Irn Bruisers, will be taking on Tiger Bay Brawlers' A; and their B team, the Maiden Grrders will also be facing off against TBB's B-Bombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FlatTrackStats predicts an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/predictortool/q/7953/7929"&gt;incredibly closely-matched bout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; between the A-teams (the result depends on which team you give "home-team advantage" to). The B-teams are almost as close in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/predictortool/q/10262/11067"&gt;FTS's predictions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, although it looks like their stats very narrowly favour the Welsh team (albeit by only a few percent). With only one exception, match-ups between GRD and TBB have been hard-fought, high-level affairs, so we do anticipate some great derby here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Rainy City Roller Derby are scheduled against simply "Glasgow Roller Derby", which we might guess is the A team... Last time they faced each other, Glasgow came out with a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/59869"&gt;convincing win&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;; but Glasgow's significant team changes this year have FTS &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/predictortool/q/10262/11067"&gt;predicting a win&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for the home team this time around. Glasgow will have to pull out something special to keep the win record on their side...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the rankings of Tiger Bay Brawlers A, and Rainy City Roller Derby, these bouts also fill in a chunk of the higher-level UK matchups missing from British Champs this year. With the results from these games, we'll be publishing an "extended" BC Tier 1 ranking, extrapolating where some of the teams not competing in T1 might have ended up, this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[On the Sunday, Kallio Roller Derby are also featuring in this derby weekend, so presumably there's some exciting train travel in Kallio's Sunday morning schedule...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://britishchamps.com"&gt;British Champs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, after an extended period &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/05/17/british-champs-at-dundee/"&gt;hosted in Scotland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the Tier 3 North fixtures continue in the North of England, with Hallam Hellcats hosting a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/587023974805101/"&gt;double-header&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of bouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7445" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/06/13267947_1010255862421996_6895825634478283487_n.jpg" alt="13267947_1010255862421996_6895825634478283487_n" width="530" height="750"&gt; Hallam's bout poster was also available as a limited edition physical print! (Design by Ed Syder) &lt;a href="http://edsyder.tumblr.com/"&gt;http://edsyder.tumblr.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hosts will be taking on Preston Roller Girls, while Scotland will be represented by Fierce Valley Roller Girls taking on Manchester Roller Derby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FVRG will be hard pressed to defeat currently unbeaten Manchester, but a loss will keep them at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.britishchamps.com/womens-tables-2016/"&gt;bottom of the table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and in danger of relegation. Meanwhile, Hallam and Preston will be fighting it out to avoid the second-from-bottom spot in the table - there's not much to call between them, but FTS believes that home-team advantage gives the hosts &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/predictortool/q/25963/8972"&gt;a slight edge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="sup"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;the Auld Reekie current team naming scheme is a bit confusing - the A team are simply "All-Stars", whilst the B team append "Reserves" and the C team "Rookies". This makes it a bit hard to unambiguously form acronyms for the two, but we're working on this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>arrg</category><category>auldreekierollergirls</category><category>british roller derby championships</category><category>fierce valley roller girls</category><category>fight hawks</category><category>fvrg</category><category>gcrd</category><category>glasgow roller derby</category><category>granite city roller derby</category><category>grd</category><category>hallam hellcats roller derby</category><category>kallio rolling rainbow</category><category>manchester roller derby</category><category>preston roller girls</category><category>upcoming bouts</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/06/02/june-11ths-packed-scottish-derby-schedule/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2016 11:04:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Auld Reekie Roller Girls WarriARRGs take on Dundee's Bonnie Colliders</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/05/04/auld-reekie-roller-girls-warriarrgs-take-on-dundees-bonnie-colliders/</link><dc:creator>kirstynsmith</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a battle royale as new Auld Reekie Roller Girls team the WarriARRGs take on Dundee's Bonnie Colliders this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="aBn"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;Sunday May 8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two east-coast teams will lock horns in an explosive game of roller derby, as the WarriARRGs showcase the latest line-up of what will be an ever-evolving squad.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the decision for ARRG to add a permanent ad-hoc team, WarriARRGs captain Cirque du Slay said:&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a large and dynamic league and it is important for us to provide opportunities for all of our members to play games against outside teams, in front of an audience, to feel part of a team and to work with new people.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“WarriARRGs will allow different groups of skaters to develop in a huge variety of ways which will help our league as a whole to get bigger and better all the time.”&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cirque said her main focus for the team was to get a sense of team bonding and thrill the audience.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said: “I'd like for us to learn to work together and try out our skills against an external team who train together and use tactics we're not used to.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I'd also like for us to go on track trusting our teammates and knowing they trust us and to have fun.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I'd like the audience to cheer themselves hoarse watching some cracking roller derby played by two teams of skaters who are on their way up.”&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is open to league members and their families and friends, who will gather at Jack Kane Sports Centre on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="aBn"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;Sunday May 8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to watch the WarriARRGs skaters fight their derby debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>annoucements</category><category>arrg</category><category>articles</category><category>auld reekie roller girls</category><category>bonnie colliders</category><category>dundee roller girls</category><category>interviews</category><category>upcoming bouts</category><category>warriarrgs</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/05/04/auld-reekie-roller-girls-warriarrgs-take-on-dundees-bonnie-colliders/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 16:20:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Auld Reekie Roller Girls head stateside to play world’s best roller derby teams</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/04/19/auld-reekie-roller-girls-head-stateside-to-play-worlds-best-roller-derby-teams/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/e041c-1458243751815.jpg" alt=""&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARRG’s All Stars will jet to America to take on some of the most talented roller derby teams on the planet later this month.
Edinburgh’s top-rated team has secured a coveted place in the three-day &lt;a href="http://ecrg.com/bigo/"&gt;Big O &lt;/a&gt;tournament in Oregon on the west coast.
This will be a whole weekend of roller derby played at the very highest skill level.
Nearly 40 teams will compete, including Team USA and six of the top 10 women’s teams in the world.
Despite an unbeaten record in 2016, the team are under no illusions as to the sizable challenge that awaits them in Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Stars co-captain Crazylegs said the team were travelling across the Atlantic for the challenge of playing higher ranked teams and to improve their WFTDA ranking position: it wasn't possible for the All Stars to secure any games against the D1 teams in Europe this season.
She said: “Competing in The Big O is huge for ARRG. It's one of the best tournaments out there, and it’s a massive opportunity for us, not only to play some of the best derby around but to improve our international ranking.
“It’s also a fantastic challenge as we are set to play four teams who are ranked as high as 20 places above us.
“Over three days we’ll be playing really experienced, well-practiced teams of a level we've probably not come against in recent times.
“We will face teams like original WFTDA member league Windy City (Chicago) who have been playing at the highest tournament levels since before our team existed!
“We hope that if we perform well enough we'll make it to WFTDA Play Offs this year - it was hard missing out by one point last season!
“To get that experience would be really good for our skaters, who also coach the rest of the league, so as always, we'll be passing along everything we learn."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://ecrg.com/bigo/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/10/THE-BIG-O_White_AS.png" alt="" width="498" height="210"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year will be the second time ARRG has travelled to the Big O. Crazylegs said the sport court skating surface had been difficult to get used to last time, so the whole team has attended special training sessions in Oldham earlier this year to prepare for the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said: “The sport court flooring does offer unique challenges, it can be unpredictable if you're not used to it - you can slide out with no warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This year we've had a couple of 10 hour round bus trips to Oldham specifically to train on the Rainy City sport court track - we're really grateful for their support in letting us use their venue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge though will be for the team to hold their focus against the top tier teams, Crazylegs added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It will be a huge test to hold our focus against these tough teams when things maybe don't go our way and to keep calm and together,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve trained incredibly hard, developed some new approaches to our game, aiming to play smarter and consolidating key tactics. We are ready for the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whatever happens, we're stoked to be there and we will bring the full might of Auld Reekie to the US in every game we play. We’ll get the outcomes we want from this tournament."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a comedy gig with a famous guy (remember Dylan Moran back in January!).
The Reserves took on the Oxbridge double.
The All Stars came second in the first ever British Championships!
And we hosted THE best Champs day in May!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The All Stars took on Glasgow in June again, a month that also featured an excellent family fun day in Portobello!
We had a Hunger Games themed Bootcamp in July! Those May the Quads be Ever in your Favour tops were a popular choice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Fringe, the All Star Reserves took on Glasgows Maiden Grrders, and then we held an awesome All Star Expo with skaters from across Scotland and Northern England!
Throughout the year we held some Taster Days and Fresh Meat intakes!
And of course the year has culminated in the Home Season and All Star Reserves season!
We've also said some sad goodbyes, but welcomed many awesome members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home Season 2015 was won by THE LEITHAL WEAPONS!! In a very closely fought game against The Skatefast Club, with the score being extremely close throughout. Congratulations to the Cherry Bombers for taking the victory in the third place game against our guests, The Rolling Bones - what a win!
Thank you to ALL of everyone who helped at the Home Season, whether you skated, officiated, announced, helped as a member of the game crew, EVERYONE. THANKS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also got the FIRST Certified officials in Scotland! Which is pretty huge! And we had official reps at some of the biggest tournaments/games around Europe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our All Star Reserves came back from an excellent trip to Copenhagen at the start of November!
They played both Copenhagen Roller Derby and Malmo's Crime City, in the one day! They did amazing for being pitted against such tough teams! So many giants. Hipster hostels. Team hang outs. Christmas. I think we can say it was still a successful trip!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now the Reserves have a couple more games in the new year! In January they will be taking on Dresden Roller Derby at home, and we can’t wait! And then another in March!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new rosters have also been announced, and the All Stars themselves have started training in time for, yes, THE BIG O! This is a fantastic opportunity and an amazing tournament. SO many amazing teams will also be there! Even the other ARRG (Arch Rival Roller Girls). And whether you can make it over to Portland (we wish), or can cheer and support from here, there is SUCH EXCITEMENT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>arrg</category><category>articles</category><category>auld reekie roller girls</category><category>british roller derby championships</category><category>home season tournament</category><category>leithal weapons</category><category>maiden grrders</category><category>review of the year</category><category>upcoming bouts</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/12/31/2015-was-arrgmazing/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2015 13:45:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Auld Reekie Roller Girls - Home Season Final 2015</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/12/28/auld-reekie-roller-girls-home-season-final-2015/</link><dc:creator>jennifergelignite</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img class="spotlight alignleft" src="https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpl1/v/t35.0-12/12359395_10153180288466022_1192149624_o.jpg?oh=24e2550bb0d345849186b5816bf3ebeb&amp;amp;oe=56835C21" alt="" width="755" height="501"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A HEART-STOPPING home season final saw the Leithal Weapons swoop to victory by just two points.
Auld Reekie Roller Girls' (ARRG) three home teams - the Leithals, Skatefast Club and the Cherry Bombers - had battled throughout autumn for the chance to take home the 2015 trophy.
Skatefast had beaten the Leithals in the first home season head-to-head and, with the Leithals struggling to field a full team for the final due to injury and illness, looked like the stronger team at the first whistle.
Skill levels were closely-matched and the lead switched several times, as both teams pushed their opponents to pull out their very best performance.
Skatefast were leading by half-time and victory seemed likely, but the Leithals re-entered the track with renewed determination.
With five minutes to the end, Skatefast had pulled ahead by 20 points, leaving the Leithals praying for a power jam.
Suddenly, the opportunity opened up with excellent defensive work from the Leithals in the very last jam.
EmKarp blasted through the Skatefast blockers and the crowd held its breath and held back tears as the points gap closed.
A smart star pass to Tuna Lovegood for an extra energy kick sealed the deal... Or so the Leithals hoped.
The unofficial result was carefully checked as both teams teetered on the brink of celebration for a score that could have gone either way.
Finally those two crucial extra points were verified and the Leithal Weapons were officially declared the 2015 winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="spotlight alignright" src="https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/12299301_10156272236840224_1957699839736333339_n.jpg?oh=fddaf7b01dbf9fe3a6fba64e58b5d64f&amp;amp;oe=57194B21" alt="" width="480" height="360"&gt;
Leithals captain Prawncess Die said she was thrilled for her team.
She said: "We went in as the underdogs.
"We thought we had a good chance but we were playing short and we had lost the last game against them.
"It was so close - I kept looking at the score thinking we can still do this.
"We drifted down 20 points a few times and, in the last few minutes, I did think that was it.
"I thought 'at least we've put up a close game'.
"Then to actually win was just fantastic."
Prawncess Die added she was particularly proud of the newest players on the team.
She said: "Dani was just outstanding, especially as a jammer.
"Everybody was playing really well but she played every position and switched from one to the other, which was very impressive."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skatefast Club captain Trifecta Gadget said everyone was very emotional.
She said: "It was a really tight game through every single jam and we never really felt safe.
"It was good to be in the lead at the end of the first half but I knew we were going to have to bring our strongest game.
"The teams were very evenly matched and I think we lost it on just a couple of jams against some really amazing Leithals players."
Gadget also praised the newest skaters on her team.
She said: "We all kept our defence strong and stayed together really well.
"It was only because we played so well as a team the score was so close.
"I could see how much more confident everybody was by the end and I'm really proud of every skater."&lt;/p&gt;

A RED-HOT new roller derby team will assemble for Auld Reekie Roller Girls’ first Edinburgh Festival Fringe game of 2015.
&lt;p&gt;Sparks are sure to fly as &lt;a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/auld-reekie-roller-girls-presents-live-roller-derby"&gt;Edinburgh’s All Star Reserves play Glasgow Roller Derby's Maiden Grrders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team captain Mallory Powers said the new skaters will raise temperatures with the fastest crossovers, big hits and speedy whips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said: “We have a brand new team and are really looking forward to bringing everyone together and building on the excitement and atmosphere of the two recent All Star derby derbies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This will be the first time the Auld Reekie and Glasgow Roller Derby B teams have played each other in a while and the teams are very different now, so no-one really knows what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The focus will be on developing our newer skaters and working as a team to achieve our goals - but we'll bring the same level of gritty determination, cheery competitiveness and fun as our wonderful All Stars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vice-captain Lady Scrapnell said she was looking forward to the new skaters playing their first festival game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said: “It's always exciting when new people skate on a team for the first time, and this time around we are lucky to have five new Reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We've all been working really hard in the All Star Reserves off-season, helping the All Stars train for their high level games, so lots of skaters have developed really quickly and we'll be really proud to be skating out with them at Meadowbank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Between us all we'll bring enthusiasm, athleticism and attitude, and will help to create one hell of a crowd atmosphere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Families are welcome to watch this test of strength, speed and agility as skaters battle through their rivals’ team using only the power of their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show rolls into town on &lt;a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/auld-reekie-roller-girls-presents-live-roller-derby"&gt;Saturday, August 8&lt;/a&gt;, at Meadowbank Sports Stadium on London Road from 2pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>arrg</category><category>articles</category><category>auld reekie roller girls</category><category>upcoming bouts</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/07/17/arrg-newbies-hit-the-fringe/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2015 15:33:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Scotland heads the Premier Tier of British Champs!</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/05/31/scotland-heads-the-premier-tier-of-british-champs/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of only a few hours ago, the first ever &lt;a href="http://www.britishchamps.com/tables-and-fixtures-ukrda-premier/"&gt;British Champs Premier &lt;/a&gt;Tier tournament ended, with the 15th and final bout of the series a surprisingly tight and tense bout between Auld Reekie Roller Girls and Central City Rollergirls.
With ARRG emerging victorious, the final placings for the 6 teams in Premier Tier are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Glasgow Roller Derby
2 Auld Reekie Roller Girls
3 Middlesbrough Milk Rollers
4 Tiger Bay Brawlers 
5 Central City Rollergirls
6 Rainy City Roller Girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scottish teams therefore take both 1st and 2nd place in the Tier, and CCR and RCRG will unfortunately relegate to the National Tier for the 2016 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully we will have more from Glasgow and Auld Reekie on their placement later.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://arrg.co.uk/"&gt;Auld Reekie Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt;, All Star Reserves take on &lt;a href="http://rollerbillies.com/"&gt;Cambridge Rollerbillies&lt;/a&gt; in their second game of the year. Having beat Oxford in the first match of he new season, the All Star Reserves will be keen to make it an Oxbridge double victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks set to be an interesting match, Cambridge are a strong team, turning in nine victories out of twelve games last year...and six out of nine in the 2013 season. Last season they lost only to LRG, Plymouth and a narrow 4 point nailbiter against Belfast. Cambridge were also finalists in the 2013 Heartland Series and winners of the 2014 Series, and are ranked 32nd in Europe, as opposed to the All Stars ranked at 61st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARRG All Star Reserves had a loss heavy season in 2014, winning only two games out of seven. They did play an extremely international season, against a broad selection of European teams, and produced impressive wins over Newcastle and Crime City.
&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/59567/rankings"&gt;Flat Track Stats&lt;/a&gt; predicts a strong win for Cambridge with a 31:23 score ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bout takes place at Meadowbank Sports Centre, Saturday 28th February, &lt;a href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/1220016"&gt;tickets&lt;/a&gt; are available in advance and more information can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/749991648420675/?ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming&amp;amp;unit_ref=popular_with_friends"&gt;Facebook Event page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2014 was another exciting year for ARRG. &lt;em&gt;January&lt;/em&gt; saw us embark upon our third annual intraleague
Home Season - and, as we’ve witnessed for the past two years, we saw the Skatefast Club and the
Leithal Weapons make it to the final, but this year, for the first time, the amazing Skatefast Club took
the title! &lt;em&gt;February&lt;/em&gt; was a busy month of training for us all, and in &lt;em&gt;March&lt;/em&gt; the Twisted Thistles played a
closed game against Tiger Bay Brawlers, and won.
&lt;em&gt;May&lt;/em&gt; saw the Thistles head off to Oregon to compete in the &lt;a href="http://thebigotournament.com/"&gt;Big O&lt;/a&gt; tournament, whilst our Cannon
Belles took on Newcastle at home, and won. We had our annual awards ball in &lt;em&gt;June&lt;/em&gt;, which is an
amazing celebration of our work both on and off skates, and a lovely excuse to get dressed up and
have a night out. In &lt;em&gt;August&lt;/em&gt; we played our annual Fringe games, first our Belles took on Dirty River
Roller Girls and then the Thistles faced London Roller Girls Brawl Saints. Sadly we were defeated on
both occasions, but the Belles did not &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; defeated and they went on to beat Hamburg at home in
&lt;em&gt;September&lt;/em&gt;. Nor were the Thistles, who also came out with a win when Royal Windsor Rollergirls
came to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the Belles headed off to Oslo for a tournament with some really highly ranked opponents;
Oslo Roller Derby and Dock City Roller Girls. The tournament was incredibly hard and both games
saw us defeated, but we fought hard for every point, coming home and ready for the last game of
the year against Malmo’s B team, ending the year on a high with a comfortable win. [And, of course, quite a few Thistles travelled across to Dallas as part of Team Scotland, as well as one in Team Belgium.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so another year ends, but this time with some BIG changes afoot for 2015. First and most
excitingly, the Thistles and Belles are no more! We have retired these names and as of January 1st,
the teams will be known as the Auld Reekie Roller Girls All Stars and All Star Reserves. This is an
exciting movement forward for us, and we are super excited. We’ve also seen big changes with our
home season, which is now taking place at the end of the year, from September to November. By
the time it comes around, we’ll have a massive number of new skaters in the league so it will
definitely not be one to miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also got a lot of really exciting games planned for this year, including being part of the &lt;a href="http://www.britishchamps.com/"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.britishchamps.com/"&gt; Championship&lt;/a&gt; Premier League where we will play with the other top 4 leagues in the UK to battle it out for
the top spot! Look out for more information on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see more and more fans at our home games, and for more information on the fixtures, check on arrg.co.uk or for any enquiries, email &lt;a href="mailto:communications@arrg.co.uk"&gt;communications@arrg.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
