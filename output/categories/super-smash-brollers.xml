&lt;p&gt;Whilst there have been many tournaments run in Scotland, there have been relatively fewer "Men's Derby" focussed events. Given the lack of MRDA member leagues in Scotland until almost a year ago, when Granite City Brawlers were accepted, it was also impossible for there to have been any "officially" sanctioned tournaments at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, though, with two MRDA member teams (Glasgow Men's Roller Derby having quietly unofficially joined a few months ago, in June, although only officially announced by MRDA this week), the time is right for an international Men's Roller Derby tournament, and where better than the home of the first MRDA members in the country, Aberdeen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Silver City Cup - named for the poetic description of Aberdeen as the "Silver City, with the Golden Sands", possibly dating to an early guide to the city* - will host 6 teams from across Europe, in a group+placement format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we reported on the Men's European Cup, we noted that several of the teams involved were also facing each other in other MRDA sanctioned events this year. Conversely, the Silver City Cup seems to have attracted all the teams who aren't appearing as much elsewhere... so this is a great opportunity to see some matchups you can't get elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27437" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/09/silvercity_map_out.png" alt="Silvercity_map_out" width="1332" height="1436"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;England: Super Smash Brollers (Nottingham), Crash Test Brummies (Birmingham)
Finland: Tampere Rollin' Bros (Tampere)
France: Kamiquadz (Montpellier)
Scotland: Granite City Brawlers (Aberdeen)
Wales: South Wales Silures (Cardiff)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt;GROUP 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt;GROUP 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt;Granite City Brawlers [661]{2.94}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt;Crash Test Brummies [618]{2.92}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt;South Wales Silures [706]{3.24}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt;KamiQuads [737]{3.8}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt;Tampere Rollin' Bros [777]{2.9}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt;Super Smash Brollers [612]{2.5}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center;" colspan="2"&gt;[FTS MRDA rating**]{SRDRank May 2018 rating}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
Within each group of 3, the teams will play round-robin (3 games per group), to produce a final group-ranking.
The 1st place winners in each group will play each other for Tournament 1st Place, whilst the 2nd places in each group will play for overall Tournament 3rd, and the bottom teams in each group will play for Tournament 5th.
&lt;p&gt;Looking at Flat Track Stats' "MRDA" ratings (which are derived only from MRDA sanctioned games played by teams), there's a pretty wide spread in predicted strength across the groups - second-highest-rated contenders, DCCLM's Kamiquadz are expected to beat lowest-rated contenders, Super Smash Brollers, by around a three-to-one points ratio! Ironically, the hosts have given themselves the harder of the two groups, based on prediction: they will be playing FTS' 1st and 3rd ranked teams of the tournament, as FTS' 4th ranked team themselves. In order to achieve their "rightful" position, they'd need to defeat the fearsome SWS in their group, before taking on the 2nd place team from Group 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at pure history, rather than ratings, the Kamiquadz are really the wildcards here. Most of their past bouts on record are, understandably, given the geography, against French men's teams, or teams from nearby Barcelona in Spain. As far as we can tell from their FTS record, the Kamiquadz have never played outside of mainland Europe before, so this will be a big change for them - the weather in Aberdeen will be a bit of a change to Montpellier! On the basis of their performances in France, however, we have no hesitation in considering them the favourites to take the 1st place in this tournament overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only slightly less of an historical wildcard for the other teams, Tampere Rollin Bros actually did play the Kamiquadz - way back in 2015 - but also have a more extensive set of travel experiences under their belts (being based in Finland forces that upon you, to some extent). In recent years, Tampere's bouts have not been MRDA-sanctioned (according to FTS), and so have not factored into their estimated strength*** - we'd actually say Tampere are somewhat overranked at present, going by their performance in their last tournament in 2017. [On the other hand, that tournament was in Barcelona, one of the most distant places Tampere have played, so it almost certainly represents a lowest bound on their expected strength at the time.]
The SRDRank ratings, which do include those games from 2017, tend to agree, placing Tampere in the same "closely-competitive" group as the rest of the field excluding KamiQuads and SWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the UK based teams, Wales's South Wales Silures have had the strongest, year to date, although far from the busiest. Despite losing 2 of their three games in May (to Manneken Beasts, and, by 2 points only!, Gothenburg Salty Seamen), their incredibly strong first game performance against the Crash Test Brummies has kept their overall performance estimate high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned Brummies have, along with Nottingham's Super Smash Brollers, been extremely busy this year - with fixtures in British Champs MRDA-side (Tier 1 for the Brummies, and 2 for the Brollers) at the start of the year, and MRDA Qualifiers for the Super Smash Brollers as well. Fittingly, perhaps, the most recent bout for the two teams to date is against each other, a narrowish win for the higher-rated Brummies (162 to 199). The two teams will get to repeat that match-up again in their Group 2 bouts, almost certainly deciding which plays for 3rd and which for 5th overall in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the hosts, Granite City Brawlers, have been stepping on the gas in terms of bout scheduling since getting MRDA membership - meeting the activity requirements to be ranked in the official rankings is a strong incentive for all members of official governing bodies. They, also, have played one of the other contenders most recently: a repeat matchup with the Super Smash Brollers resulting in a second win in a row for the Aberdeen team. FTS's MRDA rating for them, based on their past 4 games, is still trending upward, but it's not clear if it is "really" above the 700-odd mark needed to beat the Silures in their group - however, if Tampere really is as overranked as we think, the Brawlers may only need to be slightly stronger than they're currently rated to be to take their groups' 2nd place spot, and play for a likely 3rd overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Silver City Cup will be held at &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3fr8ugyweUs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Beach Leisure Centre, Aberdeen&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;22-23 September&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The "Silver" here is generally considered a reference to the "silver darlings", the herring which formed the basis of Aberdeen's historic fishing industry.

Whilst MRDA has Champs and Playoffs, there has never been a sanctioned tournament held in Scotland. Granite City Brawlers, Super Smash Brollers, Crash Test Brummies, Kamiquadz, South Wales Silures and Tampere Rollin' Bros are all looking to take the inaugural 'Silver City Cup'. With the Brawlers hoping to make their mark in the MRDA rankings, we took some time to speak to GCB's Co-Captain, Pudz (Chris Mathieson) about the upcoming tournament.
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27393" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/09/34909209_2057023227701408_2544234365819289600_o.jpg" alt="34909209_2057023227701408_2544234365819289600_o" width="1920" height="1280"&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Straight off the bat, tell us how this tournament came about?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We joined the MRDA last September and as part of this the team is required to play 5 sanctioned games a year in order to gain ranking. The bigger teams can get their games quite easily in a tournament weekend through Champs and Playoffs, however there wasn’t much opportunity for the lower seeded teams. So we put our organisational heads together and decided to put on a tournament weekend for those below 40 or unranked in the MRDA. This allows 6 teams (including Brawlers) to gain 3 of their games in a single weekend!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it feel to be able to host/create the first MRDA tournament in Scotland as well as it having quite the international flavour to it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are over the moon at having 6 teams coming from 5 countries to our little tournament in Aberdeen. We even been working with some local bodies to promote the tournament and the city. VisitAberdeenshire have even put together a web portal (&lt;a href="https://www.visitabdn.com/cp/silver-city-cup"&gt;https://www.visitabdn.com/cp/silver-city-cup&lt;/a&gt;) full of information to help our tourist friends. A lot of people see Aberdeen as this grey city with not much going on but there is such a history to it! Three top things to check out on your visit would be Dunnottar Castle (for the Game of Thrones fans), Footdee (a small area of quirky houses, 5 minutes from the venue) and Slains Castle (the backdrop of our fab logo, you might even see one of the ghouls).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As for this being the first MRDA tournament in Scotland we are delighted to showcase to the rest of our international association just what Scotland has to offer and that we can put on one hell of a tournament!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think we all want to know, how do you think GCB will fair given the tough competitors and the grueling nature of a tournament?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is GCB’s first ever tournament and as such we’re going to need to bring our A game up against some tough opponents! With a few Scotland skaters at the helm, we have some tournament experience that will hopefully help the rest of the team prepare mentally and physically. We’ll be aiming for the win and to keep the Silver City Cup in the Silver City but every team has a good chance of taking that trophy home, the very nature of a tournament weekend is that anything could happen!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You say you’ve been preparing for the tournament, how have you done this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last month we hosted a double scrim with skaters from almost every league in Scotland. This allowed us to prepare for back to back games against some high level skaters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We also have our weekly outdoor fitness sessions with Intrepid PT, these have worked doubly as both exercise and team bonding. Though its been a year and we all still hate burpees!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should the tournament fair well, could we be seeing an annual Silver City Cup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ask me when its over! Maybe not an annual tournament in Aberdeen but we’d love to see a division two type structure appear within the MRDA as it continues to grow. Obviously our end goal is MRDA Champs but that’s a few years away yet!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any final words that you would like to share with us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We really want to put on a good tournament, representing all of Scotland and we’d love a big Scottish home crowd behind us – get your tickets now - &lt;a href="https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/3446103"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/3446103&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some inspiring words from Granite City Brawlers own, Pudz. From the sounds of it, this will be an exciting weekend of roller derby so make sure you get your tickets and be a part of Scottish history on &lt;strong&gt;September 22-23 at the Beach Leisure Centre in Aberdeen&lt;/strong&gt;!

This weekend's extravaganza will feature Team England, Team Wales, Team France and Team Scotland.  I managed to wangle an opportunity to speak to 3 members of Team Scotland's Power of Scotland; Andy Morris, Skate Plissken  and Chris Mathieson, mainly I wanted to be nosy about how the Power Scotland have been preparing for the Wold Cup in Calgary. Since starting this blog piece, I have been informed that Plissken and Chris Mathieson have been voted in as the captains of Power of Scotland,  huge well done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/11/received_10156211484200587.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full" title="received_10156211484200587.jpeg" src="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/11/received_10156211484200587.jpeg" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left to right: Mathieson , Plissken and Morris (photo credit Nikki Morris)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the style of many tv hosts, I kicked off by asking a bit more about the individual skater, their history with sport and team affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up was Plissken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long have you been skating for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come January, 3 years, with no real prior skating experience…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which team do you currently skate for? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nottingham Rolled Derby’s Super Smash Brollers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a history in any other sports? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I grew up playing rugby, then moved on to American football for a little while when at uni…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was Chris Mathieson, also known as Pudz and 'that guy who scored the first points in Power of Scotland vs Team USA in the 2014 Mens Roller Derby World Cup'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long have you been skating for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been skating since July 2011, so just under four and a half years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which team do you currently skate for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granite City Brawlermen from Aberdeen and Power of Scotland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a history in any other sports?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to play football as a kid but I wasn’t great at it, other than that a little bit of street hockey when I was 10 but I sprained my ankle once and never put on a pair of skates again until I tried roller derby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my last victim for interrogation was Andy Morris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long have you been skating for? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Brawlermen started in November 2013, I did my first scrim in December 2014 after the Womens World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which team do you currently skate for? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granite City Brawlermen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a history in any other sports? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played Rugby at school, I snowboard, Surf, Cycling, Motorbikes I’m a petrolhead!
Pre Selection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then I wanted to learn more about the selection process for Power of Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When did you first try out for Team Scotland and did you try out more than once?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plissken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 2 try out selection dates; I could only make one as SSB were playing a game on the other, so I went up in May having no idea what to expect. A little nervous to say the least! But after 4 hours of skate drills, derby drills and an hour scrim I felt good about how I had performed… followed by the news I had made the 30-strong selection squad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathieson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended both tryouts in April and May 2015, and then we had to wait a month or so for the decision. It felt like forever between tryout and selection which is understandable as the quality in Scottish roller derby has increased so much since the last tournament in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making the 30 we had to train as a team for the next 4 months in the run up to a selection bout hosted by the lovely Dundee Roller Girls. The 30 played against each other in this game showcasing the best talent in Scottish men’s derby. It was a high pressure game but with a score tied until the last jam it showed how well the teams were split which made it even more exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later we found out if we had made the squad going to Calgary. I found out the news just as I was flying to London for a weekend away so a fair few celebration drinks were had and maybe even a wee visit to Double Threat Skates to get sized up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was there a long wait before you knew about being on the top 20 squad? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email for the final 20 came through a week after the PoS vs PoS game, that was the longest week ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plissken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had made the selection squad I knew I had to work hard, so I went to the 4x training sessions and 1x Scotland v Scotland (two teams made up of the selection squads) and took everything I could from each session, going back to my home league with something to work on. We were told in the first week of November if we had made the final 20, news I was very relieved and excited to hear. Now we have our final 20 we are working towards what we can take to the world cup and showing the world we the Power of Scotland can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then went on to discuss how selection for the Mens' Roller Derby World Cup had impacted their training regimes. I've seen various skater training videos (and some montages) going around on social media, so I wondered if this was typical behaviour and the guys did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you changed your training regime since being selected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plissken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely! There was no way I was going to meet other world class teams without stepping up my game. I joined a gym (not been in years), started eating better, and am currently well on the way to quitting smoking! At the gym I have been working on strength training, HIIT training (if you don’t know it, check it out) and over all endurance. This is to help strength, balance, speed and recovery time between jams. I’ve cut out take-outs, pop (well, mostly ;) can’t beat a pre-game irn-bru) and snacks (and I tell you, you don’t want them as much as you think you do!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended the gym on the run up to the PoS vs PoS game and pre tryouts quite a lot and since then I’ve taken it easy, come January I’ll be back to 5 -6 days a week. My diet hasn’t really changed a huge amount, I eat a lot of protein otherwise I don’t have the energy levels to play my best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathieson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been focused on making the Calgary squad for the last year, so have been hitting the gym since January, including some 5am sessions. There have been a few blips in the training regime and diet along the way but since making the 20 I’m back properly at the gym in preparation for 4 Nations. I also cut McDonald’s out which used to be my standard post game/training meal, which is tough seeing as there’s at least 4 between Grangemouth and Aberdeen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then wanted to find out more about Team Scotland training.  The roster for Power of Scotland features skaters from Scotland and England and as small as the UK is, so it can't be easy gathering everyone together for training. Team Scotland training takes place once a month in Grangemouth Leisure Centre, from 2016 this will increase to twice a month in the run up to the Mens Roller Derby World Cup.
I wondered if this regular travel necessitated taking time off of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plissken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a 700mile round trip for me but I generally don’t take time off.  It’s travel up, train for 4 hrs, travel back down, all within about 30 hours...and the rest!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathieson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been training monthly pre final selection but are ramping it up to twice a month in the new year. We train in Grangemouth which is about a 5 hour round trip from Aberdeen. It’s a long journey which I’ve sadly gotten used to and am currently looking into the options of a timeshare there with Momo. No time off work, but maybe just a little tired the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been training once a month but from January onwards its every two weeks. I think there will always be things getting in the way of training even more so for the guys down south, cost has a large factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a team of 20 plus bench and lineup and management is expensive no matter where you go but Canada is pretty far away and flights are not cheap. Next I quizzed the chaps on what they are doing in order to raise funds for this amazing opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathieson filled me in on Power of Scotland's fundraising activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a few fundraising events on at the moment, there are 3 skaters fighting it out to raise the most money to avoid losing their beards, craft fayres and some guest coaching sessions all over the country. I’ve just been up to Elgin training Helgin Roller Derby and Inverness City Roller Derby, which was a pleasure, giving some of them their first experience in wall and pack work drills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a general fundraising page, which if anyone has a few pennies to spare to help the team it would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally we got onto the subject that so many of us as looking forward to, the Mens Roller Derby World Cup 2016. The Men's Roller Derby World Cup 2016 in Calgary will be a first time for Morris and Plissken with Mathieson making his second appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What part of the World Cup are you most looking forward to? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere at the last one was incredible, I can’t wait for that excitement again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plissken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, challenging myself against other national skaters, I know it’s not going to be easy but how good is it going to feel if I can get lead on Johnathan R? We can all dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathieson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than going to Canada, which is number 2 on the list of countries I’d love to visit, I’m looking forward to the challenge of our group stage. It’s been described as the ‘Group of Death’ but I think we can come out of it strong and it will make for some exciting games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Team are you most excited to play against?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathieson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to us playing the USA again. Last time we managed to score 40 points against them which was a big deal and I think with the team we have this year we will show them how far Scottish roller derby has progressed since then. Goal – first blood!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plissken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USA, that’s the dream but I’m sure its everyone on the team has the dream to be selected for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you could be in any other bracket, which bracket would you choose and why? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plissken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t! we have a great set of teams to play, and we have the 6 teams instead of 5 so we get loads of games to play, plus I get to go against the giants, Team USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I would chose any of the other brackets, the bracket we are in will be the one to watch ☺&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathieson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d go into the Orange group so that we could play against Argentina, they were the heroes of the tournament last time, El Pibe &amp;lt;3!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be Mathieson's second time representing Power of Scotland in the Men's Roller Derby World Cup. I wanted to find out if this had had an impact on his 2016 training regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You played in the World Cup in 2014, are you doing anything different this time to prepare?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last tournament was one of the best weekends of my life but on the lead up to it I was studying for my professional exams so I had to juggle the two with derby sometimes taking a back seat. This time around though this is my main focus and I’ll be putting everything I’ve got into it, attending as much training and scrimmage as possible. I’ve watched the footage of myself in the last world cup and although I scored the first points against USA it’s a horrible jam to watch, so many falls. But watching it back gives me the drive to do better this time round, upping my game and upping my fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally I asked for their predictions for the World Cup...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathieson
Scotland to lift the trophy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plissken
There’s going to be a lot of talent, so I predict a lot of cheering (please!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USA for the win, Canada/England for second and third and I think Scotland defiantly have the potential to better the last world cup position, it’s a very strong team!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge thank you to Mathieson, Morris and Plissken for taking the time to answer my many, many questions.
Wishing Power of Scotland all the luck!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>4nations</category><category>articles</category><category>granite city brawlermen</category><category>interviews</category><category>men's roller derby</category><category>power of scotland</category><category>roller derby world cup calgary 2016</category><category>super smash brollers</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/11/27/getting-to-know-power-of-scotland/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2015 11:48:04 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
