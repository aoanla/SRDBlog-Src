There are exciting things to write about, across the world, as well, so we'll break this up region by region! Because of the prevalence of Facebook (and the fact that its Events are one of the few useful things about it), all links to events will be there; but we'll include enough info for you to get to the event without needing anything owned by Mark Zuckerberg. Where possible, we link to league websites, or to their Instagram when it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;

With people travelling across the world to attend, the schedule elsewhere is a little sparse, but there are still exciting things happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also included a bonus section in this week's roundup highlighting sessions at Rollercon itself which we think are either interesting, or important, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This list was updated on Thursday 18th to include late announced bouts on Sunday in Mexico and Argentina&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Short Track Roller Derby events calendar is building for the year already, and there's a lot of things to talk about, so we're bringing you a new edition of the Short Track News roundup earlier than we expected to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first development is that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com/"&gt;Rolla Skate Club&lt;/a&gt; now host a dedicated &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com/short-track-roller-derby-resources/"&gt;Short Track Roller Derby Resources&lt;/a&gt; page, with the rules and other info.
(We know that it's also set to gain more resources, too, as they're produced.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Animated Gif of Short Track resources page" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/05/ShortTrackResources.gif"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The new Rolla Skate Club "Short Track Resources page"!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the USA, the biggest Short Track event upcoming is probably the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rollercon.com"&gt;Rollercon&lt;/a&gt; event series. Building on their appearance at the last Rollercon (the public debut of the ruleset, in fact),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Rollercon 2019 will feature multiple items:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;ul class="first last simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"AA-level" Short Track Exhibition Game "Short Skirts versus Sleeves" (20 July, 20:45)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 MVP-pass holder on Skates sessions on Short Track with Rolla Skate Club [19 July 16:50, 20 Jul 18:00]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Track Scrimmage for Short Track (19 July, 20:00)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're at Rollercon from the 17th July, then we encourage you to go check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other US and Canadian teams continue to use Short Track Roller Derby; Pittsburgh Short Track Roller Derby, in particular, continue to be a purely Short Track league, and are holding regular open training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Canada, we know that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/nelsonrollerderby/"&gt;Nelson Killjoys&lt;/a&gt; of British Columbia, will be hosting a tournament for 6 teams, at some point later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alberta, Canada, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://fmrollerderby.com/"&gt;Fort McMurray Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; are planning to use short track rules for their home teams season, allowing them to support more home teams with their current roster. (Scheduled for around October 2019)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="The first edition of Iru Navarro's fanzine, including an introduction to Short Track rules." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/05/shorttrack-fanzine-latin-america.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The first edition of Iru Navarro's fanzine, including an introduction to Short Track rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further afield, Latin America continues to explore the Short Track ruleset [an Argentine fanzine is covering the rules in translation issue by issue], and in South Korea, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/OHDerbyKorea/"&gt;OH! Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; (Facebook link) are hosting scrimmages using the ruleset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In South Africa, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.capetownrollergirls.com/main/"&gt;Cape Town Rollergirls&lt;/a&gt; are planning a second Short Track event after the success of their first on the 26th April. Whilst not announced officially yet, the &lt;strong&gt;8th June&lt;/strong&gt; is the provisional date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Calendar of events (blue - games, yellow - Rollercon, purple - bootcamps and workshops)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Europe&lt;/strong&gt;, however, there's a bunch of exciting workshops / bootcamps / tournaments coming up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literally next weekend: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/chromesirensrollerderby/"&gt;Gdańsk Chrome Sirens Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; are following up on the previous success of a Short-Track double header with a Polish Short Track Tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;25 May&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2269056513308318/"&gt;[FACEBOOK EVENT]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vratislavia MadChix Roller Squad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worst Warsaw Derby Team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3City Piranhas Roller Derby (Gdańsk)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gdańsk Chrome Sirens Roller Derby [two teams]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mystery 6th team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;This will be a full round-robin tournament, with 10 bouts to decide the overall winner. Entry will be free - and the whole event will be livestreamed at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.twitch.tv/chromesirens"&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/chromesirens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the very near future, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gogogent.be/nl/home-nl-2/"&gt;GO-GO Gent Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; host a special edition of Star Track (their SKOD spin-off) with a Short Track focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;1 - 2 June 2019&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1002943783428385/"&gt;[FACEBOOK EVENT]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coached by UAE Roller Derby All-Stars' Inga Knee'her, the current design has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="last simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st June:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Morning session: Short Track Rules &amp;amp; Drills with Inga Knee'her and UAE Roller Derby (including low-contact and other variants, potentially)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Afternoon session: Short Track mini-tournaments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd June:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short Track mini-tournament continues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes for this structure are still possible, depending on attendance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia continues its promotion of Short Track with multiple events:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;&lt;ul class="first last simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public Short Track Roller Derby bout (Baltic Witches (St-Petersburg C) versus Raptors Derby Moscow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;img alt="The Short Track Experiment (Leeds) Logo" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/05/ALLIN-SHORTTRACK.jpg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.allincrd.uk/"&gt;ALL IN Roller Derby Community&lt;/a&gt; host their "Short Track Experiment"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;A 1 day workshop exploring the Short Track ruleset - including low-contact rules as well as the full contact standard. Includes OTA and WFTDA-gender policy games (open to not-quite-mins-passed-but-internal-scrim-ready skaters for the Low Contact games). Includes time for discussion between games, and a low-pressure environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This will run from midday to 5pm in the Ramgarhia Sikh Sport Centre, Leeds.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

National Teams are themselves built on the same concept: an expression of a common aspect of identity, drawn from a sense of belonging to or of a particular geographical region, culture or ethnicity.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;A positive effect of all such teams is that they can give visibility to the concerns and experiences of the community they represent; this can be, and commonly is, the founding aim of such a team. This is certainly the case for the newest such project: the Jewish Roller Derby team, which launched only a few weeks ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;We talked to Jewish Roller Derby's founders, Tiggz and Jodi Bon Jodi, both from Rose City Rollers, about their aims for the team, and how you can be involved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Tiggz was drawn to form the team partly from her experience within another team drawn from shared history: the 2018 Team Russia Roller Derby. Whilst she enjoyed her time in a National Team and at the World Cup, she was conscious that she didn’t experience the same level of shared-history as the rest of the team did with each other. As the only team member qualifying via a relative with Russian-Jewish heritage, Tiggz was drawn to think about the importance of that other aspect of her culture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;This experience was, perhaps, emphasised by living and working in Portland, itself a city with a very small Jewish population (as Jodi noted to us, “if I played for Gotham, maybe I’d not have felt the same need to make a team to represent Jewish people”, given New York’s ownership of the largest Jewish community outside Israel).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;But, more than that, it was also the feeling that this was a time when Jewishness needed more voices to counter rising bigotry which drove the pairs’ final decision to make the team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;It would take considerable ignorance of history to not be aware of the long-standing spectre of anti-Semitism across the world. Whilst many vocal proponents of this insidious bigotry became quieter in the later half of the 20th century, over the last few decades (and especially the last few years), anti-Semitic speech and conspiracy theories have once again become a dangerous thread in politics, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and elsewhere. Only a few days ago, for example, a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2018/11/europe/antisemitism-poll-2018-intl/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;CNN International poll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; reported that around a quarter of Europeans polled believed that "Jews have too much influence in business and finance" and "have too much influence in conflict and wars worldwide", and similar figures are reported from the USA. Coupled with dog-whistle attacks from powerful world leaders, and an alarming increase in anti-Semitism motivated murders and assaults worldwide, it's an increasingly dangerous and difficult time to be Jewish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;One way in which we can counter bigotry is to educate and shine a light on those groups discriminated against; bigotry stems from ignorance, and merely being more visible can help to fight fear and intolerance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The word and concept of "Jewishness" incorporates, inherently, a number of interrelated-yet-distinct qualities - belief in (and or practice of) a particular religion, participation in a particular culture, possession of a particular ethnicity or lineage - which any particular Jewish person may participate in all aspects of, or only some or one. (Indeed, there are multiple ethnic divisions within the overall “Jewish ethnicity”, with distinct traditions and languages.) As such, Tiggz and JBJ consider the question of "eligibility" of applicants to be one that should be settled by the applicant themselves, not imposed by a strict definition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;"I'd say to someone wanting to know if they can apply: ask yourself, 'what would it mean to you to be part of a Jewish Roller Derby team?', and decide based on that", says Tiggz.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;In fact, the founders are excited to see what a spectrum of Jewishness sign up for the project: from people of the Ashkenazi heritage who form the basis for much of Europe’s idea of “Jewish”, through Sephardim, Mizrahim, Maghrebhim and others; and to take opportunities to educate both each other and the Roller Derby community about their diversity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The first "competitive aim" for the Jewish Roller Derby project is to field a WFTDA-gender-policy team at the next Rollercon, against an opponent to be decided. After that, the founders have no concrete plans, although there's always more teams that can be challenged; from National teams to others attached to important campaigns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;More importantly, of course, the Jewish Roller Derby project aims to, whatever bouts it participates in, provide both a space in which Jewish skaters can find community with one-another, and a space and platform for educating and advocating for the Jewish community, at a time when it is needed once again. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The Jewish Roller Derby project can be contacted via Facebook on their page: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/jewishrollerderby/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/jewishrollerderby/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; and by email at:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:jewishrollerderby@gmail.com"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; jewishrollerderby@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
