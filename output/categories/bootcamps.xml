Even doing that, it's a packed schedule, including: Bologna's Hyenas hosting two days of roller derby at the Ferrara Tattoo Convention, a double header of derby up in Aberdeen, Nantes and Gdańsk both hosting events to celebrate their leagues' respective anniversaries,  a whole sur5al tournament in New Zealand, and a &lt;em&gt;two-track&lt;/em&gt; international tournament in Hull! (And more - the first MRDA-sanctioned triple header in Spain, a weekend of derby in Querétaro... !)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're trying to stick to our rules below, so a lot of events - especially in Australia, which is currently at the height of its Spring events schedule - are having to be missed off the list. (We're open to considering treating very large countries in terms of their constituent States, for the purpose of allowing events, but we'd like the community to let us know how they feel about that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're not even mentioning the Short Track Roller Derby events this weekend to save space - they're all in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/shorttrack-102019/"&gt;this roundup post&lt;/a&gt; if you want to catch up with them (although we've marked them on the map). They're all highlights, but this is a super busy weekend, so something has to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3rd fixture of the Chilean national tournament happens this weekend, as does the final of the New Zealand Top 10 Championshops 2019; as well as a number of large tournament events (perhaps the largest being in Sydney, Australia, and Lille, France). There's charity derby in Teesside, and even an international roller derby bootcamp up north in Iceland!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).

We have two 10th birthdays of leagues, several bootcamps and tournaments (including possibly our favourite one, the Hot Chilli Cup - providing both Junior derby bootcamp and tournament in Australia), and a bunch of exciting derby in Argentina. As there are so many deserving events, we'll be having an addendum to cover significant things in the Sunday-Monday period later in the week.&lt;/p&gt;

Sunday seems to be the preferred day for things in Latin America, with two events in Bogotá (including a collaboration exercise between 4 of the local leagues), one in Mexico, and the previously mentioned Patagonian bootcamp in run by Vendaval in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK, meanwhile is full of bootcamps and mini-bootcamps for all those not at British Champs over the weekend...&lt;/p&gt;

Queensland's state tournament has its Grand Final this Saturday; as does British Championships, with their Playoffs deciding the winners in both divisions. There are several leagues celebrating reaching their 1st decade of existence in various ways, an exciting bootcamp in Cancùn, Mexico, and a lot of roller derby in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

The coming few days, as well as seeing the first of the WFTDA Playoffs (with attendees from) also see the first in a regular series of Short Track events in the UK, a a gaggle of bootcamps and clinics from the UK to Argentina, and even more tournaments.

In particular:
not one, but two Australian teams play in the first WFTDA Continental Cup of the season; and the first of two Playoffs for the Mexican National Tournament is held in Chihuahua over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an unprecedented number of Sunday tournaments in France on the 23rd, so we've picked two of them (the most fun, and the most "international") as a representation. There's actually 5 in total!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also one Monday event in the list, so watch out for that in Edinburgh, especially if you're interested in the Officiating side of the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kat Malin-August's series of &lt;strong&gt;NSO Workshops&lt;/strong&gt; is now at its fifth edition, and is doing something a little different. Previous sessions have been focused on a particular NSOing role, but this one covers what we'd call "essential officiating ambient knowledge". That is: all the things that experienced officials "just pick up" over years of officiating, but never think to actually have a session on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will include, but not limited to: Completing and maintaining a games history, how to apply for tournaments, how WFTDA Cert + Online Training works, recommendations for paraphernalia (whistles, stopwatches etc), and recommendations for other resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign up is still open, and as always, these workshops are free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event starts: 1900 &lt;em&gt;Monday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue: CodeBase, Argyle House, 38 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh, Scotland&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/452017048701178/"&gt;[FACEBOOK LINK]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rollerderbyrennes.fr/"&gt;Roller Derby Rennes&lt;/a&gt; present a Harry Potter themed mini-tournament event, "Harry Pot d’Beurre* et les gros hits de la mort". Four "house teams" formed by open subscription play short format games (1 period each) for the Cup, followed by a scrimmage betweeen Rennes' B skaters and Le Mans B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pouffsouffle (Hufflepuff) versus Serdaigle (Ravenclaw)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gryffondor (Gryffindor) versus Serpentard (Slytherin)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third Place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mortal Condate (Rennes B) versus Chicaneuses (Le Mans B) [Scrimmage]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event starts: 1200 Sunday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/calacas_acidas/"&gt;Calacas Acidas&lt;/a&gt; host a "Triangular Acido", a triple-header round robin (the most popular format in Argentina, we think) event. This one is slightly unusual, as two of the competing teams are hybrids: Calacas Acidas + MDQueens, and Brujas + Rebeldes del Asfalto!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teams:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calacas Acidas (Necochea) + MDQueens (Mar del Plata)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atomic Bombs Roller Derby (Lanùs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brujas Roller Girls (Bahía Blanca) + Rebeldes Asfalto (Mar del Plata)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are not listed in FTS, as two of the teams involved are not rateable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event starts: 1000 Sunday ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue: 73 Y 36 EET Nº3, Necochea, Argentina&lt;/p&gt;
