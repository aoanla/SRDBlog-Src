National Teams are themselves built on the same concept: an expression of a common aspect of identity, drawn from a sense of belonging to or of a particular geographical region, culture or ethnicity.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;A positive effect of all such teams is that they can give visibility to the concerns and experiences of the community they represent; this can be, and commonly is, the founding aim of such a team. This is certainly the case for the newest such project: the Jewish Roller Derby team, which launched only a few weeks ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;We talked to Jewish Roller Derby's founders, Tiggz and Jodi Bon Jodi, both from Rose City Rollers, about their aims for the team, and how you can be involved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Tiggz was drawn to form the team partly from her experience within another team drawn from shared history: the 2018 Team Russia Roller Derby. Whilst she enjoyed her time in a National Team and at the World Cup, she was conscious that she didn’t experience the same level of shared-history as the rest of the team did with each other. As the only team member qualifying via a relative with Russian-Jewish heritage, Tiggz was drawn to think about the importance of that other aspect of her culture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;This experience was, perhaps, emphasised by living and working in Portland, itself a city with a very small Jewish population (as Jodi noted to us, “if I played for Gotham, maybe I’d not have felt the same need to make a team to represent Jewish people”, given New York’s ownership of the largest Jewish community outside Israel).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;But, more than that, it was also the feeling that this was a time when Jewishness needed more voices to counter rising bigotry which drove the pairs’ final decision to make the team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;It would take considerable ignorance of history to not be aware of the long-standing spectre of anti-Semitism across the world. Whilst many vocal proponents of this insidious bigotry became quieter in the later half of the 20th century, over the last few decades (and especially the last few years), anti-Semitic speech and conspiracy theories have once again become a dangerous thread in politics, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and elsewhere. Only a few days ago, for example, a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2018/11/europe/antisemitism-poll-2018-intl/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;CNN International poll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; reported that around a quarter of Europeans polled believed that "Jews have too much influence in business and finance" and "have too much influence in conflict and wars worldwide", and similar figures are reported from the USA. Coupled with dog-whistle attacks from powerful world leaders, and an alarming increase in anti-Semitism motivated murders and assaults worldwide, it's an increasingly dangerous and difficult time to be Jewish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;One way in which we can counter bigotry is to educate and shine a light on those groups discriminated against; bigotry stems from ignorance, and merely being more visible can help to fight fear and intolerance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The word and concept of "Jewishness" incorporates, inherently, a number of interrelated-yet-distinct qualities - belief in (and or practice of) a particular religion, participation in a particular culture, possession of a particular ethnicity or lineage - which any particular Jewish person may participate in all aspects of, or only some or one. (Indeed, there are multiple ethnic divisions within the overall “Jewish ethnicity”, with distinct traditions and languages.) As such, Tiggz and JBJ consider the question of "eligibility" of applicants to be one that should be settled by the applicant themselves, not imposed by a strict definition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;"I'd say to someone wanting to know if they can apply: ask yourself, 'what would it mean to you to be part of a Jewish Roller Derby team?', and decide based on that", says Tiggz.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;In fact, the founders are excited to see what a spectrum of Jewishness sign up for the project: from people of the Ashkenazi heritage who form the basis for much of Europe’s idea of “Jewish”, through Sephardim, Mizrahim, Maghrebhim and others; and to take opportunities to educate both each other and the Roller Derby community about their diversity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The first "competitive aim" for the Jewish Roller Derby project is to field a WFTDA-gender-policy team at the next Rollercon, against an opponent to be decided. After that, the founders have no concrete plans, although there's always more teams that can be challenged; from National teams to others attached to important campaigns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;More importantly, of course, the Jewish Roller Derby project aims to, whatever bouts it participates in, provide both a space in which Jewish skaters can find community with one-another, and a space and platform for educating and advocating for the Jewish community, at a time when it is needed once again. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The Jewish Roller Derby project can be contacted via Facebook on their page: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/jewishrollerderby/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/jewishrollerderby/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; and by email at:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:jewishrollerderby@gmail.com"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; jewishrollerderby@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Orkney's ViQueens have been working hard on becoming bout ready since their founding in January 2017, and have taken less than 20 months to do so, which is fairly impressive work. This will be an away game, as is common for debut bouts, hosted in the Capital of the Highlands, Inverness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Inverness City Roller Derby are the closest bouting league to Orkney, it will still be a 180 km trip, as the crow flies, for the skaters attending their first ever bout as a team. (Whilst Elgin is a closer location, direct, it's faster to get to Inverness, due to the need to land at a sea- or airport at the mainland.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inverness City Roller Derby themselves, whilst very experienced, have only 2 public bouts on record themselves, as the travel costs for Highlands teams are difficult in general. (We'd hope that, together with Helgin Roller Derby, and potentially new league Ullapool Slayers, the newly bouting Orkney would allow a small "Highlands Leagues" cluster to support more sustainable competition in the future.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We caught up with Orkney ViQueens founder, DeafWish, to learn about the team's history and feelings at this critical point in their existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-27229 aligncenter" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/08/orkneyviqueens.jpg" alt="OrkneyViQueens" width="370" height="370"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Orkney is a bit more isolated than the majority of locations for Roller Derby leagues. How have you been coping with the higher cost of travel - for your skaters, and for guests? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;We know it’s not the easiest place to get to, so we offer to accommodate visiting skaters and coaches wherever possible.  We can also advise on cheaper routes and travel options. We try to make dates known as far in advance as we can, to help with being able to get cheaper options.  We also have some great support and sponsorship: [Orkney-based jewellers] Ortak will allow us to use some of their self-catering accommodation to host officials for when we have a game at home (hopefully next year!) and when we travel [Northern isles ferry operator] Northlink offer us a discount on ferry travel, which really helps.
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Whilst this is your first public bout, Orkney ViQueens have had a very active first year and half. What's been the most important thing the team has done? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Undoubtedly it’s been our bootcamps.  We had four in the first year, which let us progress to the next stage of our skills, learn from some amazing skaters, and meet people from other leagues who came to skate with us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What have you been working on most, ahead of your first game? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The biggest challenge we have is being so isolated. We have no referees, NSOs or experienced skaters to help us navigate some of the more intricate penalties or elements of gameplay. We have been focusing on gameplay aspects like jam starts, responding to penalty calls, maintaining a pack and identifying people’s preferred roles.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
Inverness City have been a fixture of the ‘Northern’ cluster of Scottish Derby for a long while - how do your teams get on?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Both Inverness and Aberdeen's Granite City (our other nearest neighbour [by travel distance]!) are brilliant. We have had coaches and skaters from both come up to bootcamps with us, and they are always ready to answer our questions and offer advice and help. Natorious and Monica Yeller were our first bootcamp coaches so we are thrilled that Inverness are now our first opponents.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
What are your aims for your debut bout? Do you have a target score, just looking to play the game, or something else you want to do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;We would like to play the game well as a team. For us that means working together, developing confidence in our roles, keeping our penalty count down and having fun.  Inverness are an experienced team so they are going to be a challenge for us, which we are looking forward to!
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What's next for Orkney ViQueens? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Building our pool of officials to help us have a better grasp of the game and have more effective scrims, and also recruiting and training bench and LUM staff. We are lucky for this game to have Hydra (Rule 56 and Rainy City Roller Derby) benching for us and some of our pre-mins skaters and family having the opportunity to learn NSO and LUM roles in this game. We will then build on this knowledge going forward.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;We have a busy few months coming up, with plans for another bootcamp with (Pay as you Feel Coaching's) Nuke and Udder in October; Granite City Roller Derby are coming for a skating holiday with us and we are hoping to have another away game in November. We are also continuing to develop our youth team, Orkney ViTeens, with after-school sessions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inverness City Roller Derby versus Orkney ViQueens Roller Derby will be held at &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DZjmoUJMWVE2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inverness Royal Academy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;18th August&lt;/strong&gt;, from &lt;strong&gt;midday&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>interviews</category><category>inverness city roller derby</category><category>orkney viqueens</category><category>upcoming bouts</category><guid>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/08/15/orkneys-viqueens-invade-inverness/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2018 10:25:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Roller Derby comes to Kyoto! ローラーダービーが京都に来る。</title><link>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/06/12/roller-derby-comes-to-kyoto-roradabigajing-du-nilai-ru/</link><dc:creator>SRD</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here at SRD, we always like to see Roller Derby expanding into new places; especially places where there's been no roller derby before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst Roller Derby has been in Japan (in Okinawa and Tokyo, and, until this year, Misawa), there's been little growth outside of those regions. (Tokyo Roller Derby have expanded to contain teams based in the surrounding cities, such as Yokohama, but not outside the Kantō region; the most recent independent team, Kamikaze Badass, is also based in Tokyo.) So, it was particularly exciting to see the announcement this year of a new league, based in Kyōto, in the Kansai region!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We caught up with Kyoto Roller Derby's founders, Kat and Josie, to find out a bit more about them, and what inspired them to seed more roller derby in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-26824 aligncenter" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/06/kyotord.jpg" alt="KyotoRD" width="621" height="480"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's been a while since the last Roller Derby league was founded in Japan. Can you tell us a bit about yourselves as founders? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Kat: I skated with Bath Roller Derby Girls in the U.K. and I absolutely loved it! The team was in its early stages back then and it was so nice to be a part of something at the ground level. After moving to Japan and being really far away from any teams here, I kept writing messages of desperation on Facebook forums hoping to pique some interest. Eventually someone replied! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Josie: That would be me! I had been living in Japan for two years, teaching English and loving life up in the mountains, but every day I was still pining for the outlet that is derby. I messaged Kat having seen a plea of hers, and was thrilled to meet another skater out here. At the time we lived a few hours apart, so it wasn’t easy to meet up. But quickly we realised that a derby team was needed in the Kansai area. I began skating first at drop-in sessions with Bristol back in 2012, then for Severn Roller Torrent in Gloucester. I skated with SRT for two years, before moving to Japan in 2015. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The moment we met we couldn’t help reminiscing about all the things that derby meant to us. It’s such an important space and community that we felt could really bring a lot to Kyoto. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All but two Roller Derby leagues in Japan were founded by non-Japanese skaters; how are you reaching out to the people of Kyoto to grow the league? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Josie: We’ve been fortunate enough to work with and become friends with some amazing people out here, and we are really keen for all of our practices, future events and bouts to be a community thing. We are committed to using Japanese and English in all of our communications on social media and really strive to be as inclusive as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Kat: This is definitely really important to both of us, and we want to encourage as many new Japanese members to join us as possible. I recently watched the animation Aggretsuko, and couldn’t ignore the parallels between that and derby as a form of stress release. The show is about an awesome red panda who works in a sh&lt;em&gt;tty office, full of sh&lt;/em&gt;tty male bosses who talk down to her all day, and although she is sweet during working hours, at night she blasts out thrash metal karaoke to release her stress. I basically feel like derby could be this for so many of my friends! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kamikaze Badass Roller Derby Tokyo found that one issue they've had is with the conflation of Roller Game and Roller Derby in the minds of potential recruits. In the short time you've been in existence, have you identified any specific issues to deal with?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Often staff at venues have a negative view of it and think it’s going to be too dangerous, because of the associations with Roller Game.  Also a lot of younger people see roller skating as very dated, and don’t consider it as a sport for the modern age. We’ve reached out to a lot of leagues for help and guidance on this type of thing, as we are aiming to be as transparent and respectful as possible, whilst also smashing any preconceptions, as respectfully as possible of course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting a league off the ground also needs resources as well as people power. How can the Community help Kyoto Roller Derby - and how are you planning to grow your resources? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;We’ve actually just announced our first fundraiser at our local Japanese-run burrito joint, where we’ll be selling baked goods and our first official merch &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/162229187965089/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;see here for this event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;. Ideally we hope to hold a number of fundraisers throughout the year in order to spread the word and purchase essential kit for our fresh meat team. We’ve also been in touch with the wonderful Derby Without Borders &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/06/05/derby-without-borders-an-interview-with-founder-mae-dae/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;see our interview here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; who provide second hand kits for up and coming leagues across the globe, and that was after a tip from you, and from another within the Tokyo derby community. Worldwide derby spirit is definitely already pushing us in the right direction and we are so grateful, so we hope that as many people as possible will want to help us get going. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do you see Kyoto Roller Derby in the future? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;We want to see Kyoto Roller Derby as an active league in Japan, visiting teams around the country as well as worldwide! We want to have a really positive influence within the local community, with as many people as possible coming to watch our games, and feeling encouraged and empowered to get involved. Roller derby has had such an incredible impact on both of our lives and we can’t wait to watch it grow in Kyoto.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about Kyoto Roller Derby, and support them, on their social media platforms:&lt;/p&gt;

One of the recent great examples of the way the Roller Derby community can band together to support itself is the &lt;a href="http://www.skatingoutofbounds.com/derby-without-borders/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derby Without Borders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Project, which has been working to supply resources to Roller Derby leagues in need since last year.
As the project continues, we caught up with founder Mae Dae to find out where the project came from - and how you can help it to continue to help Roller Derby everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-26810 aligncenter" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/06/derbywithoutborders.png" alt="derbywithoutborders" width="600" height="400"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;So, for people who don't know you: let's start with "who's Mae Dae, and what is Skating Out of Bounds?"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I’m 28 years old and I love roller derby. I first started skating with a small league in Northern California, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://sonomacountyrollderby.org/"&gt;Sonoma County Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, in 2014. In 2017 I left my league, and home, to go on a back packing trip through Europe. I knew I couldn’t possibly live without derby in my life so I brought my skates with me. Skating Out of Bounds was originally a blog about my travel and derby experiences elsewhere. Mainly it was for my friends to read. I also would send people little care packages from different places I visited through the site as well. Since then, it’s evolved into something entirely different. I’ve actually deactivated the blog even, because it doesn’t feel relevant to it’s purpose anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we're here to talk about is something which started as a spinoff of Skating Out of Bounds - the Derby Without Borders project. I think the idea first came to you at the 2017 WFTDA &lt;a href="https://wftda.com/rdws/"&gt;World Summit&lt;/a&gt; in Manchester, so can you talk us through the background?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, at the Summit there was a panel of skaters from what were identified as “emerging regions” in derby. They all discussed different struggles they had with making derby accessible in their own leagues. One of the struggles that was universal was that for varying different reasons they all struggled with getting skates and protective gear. This is a huge barrier for the sport to grow in these areas as it can be so discouraging to wait months for skates to arrive. It was sort of a lightbulb moment and I chatted with several of the panellists after to see if they would somehow be interested in receiving some donations if I could get some together. I also chatted with Master Blaster there and she thought it was a great idea. I told her about my blog and travels so she said to come by her shop in Berlin and we could make it happen. She was the first of several people to believe in my idea, and well the rest all kind of fell into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derby Without Borders' first "concrete goal" was to provide kit to support &lt;a href="http://sailorcityrollers.com/"&gt;Sailor City Rollers &lt;/a&gt;in Argentina - for which you ran a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/derbywithoutborders"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; , as well as a stall at RollerCon. What was the support like for the project at RollerCon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t even expecting to have a booth at Rollercon to be honest. But I figured if I didn’t ask I wouldn’t so I emailed to see if they would be ok with me having a booth. I was so excited when they told me they’d donate a space to me! I think the support was great, people who heard about the project were happy to help and we got a considerable amount of donations. I struggled to get the information out to enough people ahead of time so there were a lot of people who had said they wished they had known sooner and they would have brought more donations with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you have any unexpected help, or setbacks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My neighbouring booth at Rollercon, F Yeah Printing, were so sweet and we made good friends! They have been so supportive since then and have offered a fundraiser through their printing service, [&lt;a href="https://fyeahprinting.com/collections/derby-without-borders"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;link]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where you can buy Skating Out of Bounds and Derby Without Borders merchandise and a portion of the proceeds go to helping fund the project. They’ve also been really helpful with sharing social media posts about the project which is a lot more helpful than people think!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t call them setbacks, but definitely some big learning moments. I had a bit of a mix up with travel plans at the end of Rollercon and had to leave mid day on Sunday. Which meant packing up the booth early. I didn’t think about it at the time, but of course, everyone wanted to leave donations at the end of the event. So even though the booth was packed up people still left quite a few donations behind. I definitely changed my approach for the World Cup booth because of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Following up on that, the project's next appearance was at the &lt;a href="http://www.rollerderbyworldcuplive.com/"&gt;Roller Derby World Cup 2018&lt;/a&gt;, back in Manchester. As well as passing on the kit the project had collected for Sailor City to Team Argentina's skaters, you extended the project to a huge number of other teams - can you tell us a bit about the current beneficiaries, and how they were selected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure! So I already had a contact with &lt;a href="http://goldencityrollers.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Golden City&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [Johannesburg] in South Africa and knew that Team South Africa would be at the World Cup so it made sense to collect for them too. Everything we collected at the World Cup went with them, and the Rollercon donations got passed on to the Team Argentina skaters from Sailor City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the other beneficiaries have been through word of mouth for the most part. Either friends of mine have mentioned a league somewhere and I’ve reached out, or leagues in need have heard of the project and reached out to me directly. Our list keeps growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26811" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/06/miraclewhipsdwb.jpg" alt="MiracleWhipsDWB" width="960" height="720"&gt; Team Canada's Miracle Whips hanging out by the Derby Without Borders stall at the Roller Derby World Cup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running Derby without Borders must be a big logistical task. Can you tell us who is currently involved in the project with you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be completely lost without all the help I’ve gotten so far. I’ve had tons of friends help out in all kinds of ways. Two of my former league mates, WiFly and H.A.M. Slice, helped design my two logos, and I had amazing volunteers at both booths. My two closest friends, KT Wrecks and Leethal, have also been amazing cheerleaders and sounding boards for the project since it started. I also had to work out some serious logistics for getting the Rollercon donations from my storage unit in California to Manchester for the World Cup. That was a combination of a good friend, Wicked Lizard, driving my donations to an event she was reffing at and Pia Mess, who would be coming to World Cup, picking them up from her and then me paying for an additional checked bag to get them there. Totally doable, but a lot of figuring out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my closest friends in London, Jem, has been a cornerstone for me since re-igniting the project here. She’s helped out a lot with planning, the booth at the World Cup, helping transport donations and being supportive of the project even when I feel like giving up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current league mates at &lt;a href="http://www.londonrockinrollers.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;London Rockin’ Rollers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have donated tons of items and quite a few volunteered at the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been so grateful for the support of Master Blaster and Smarty Pants. They’ve both been really supportive and have offered several resources throughout the whole project. Both &lt;a href="http://www.quadrollerskateshop.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quad Skate Shop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://strongathletic.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Athletic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have sponsored the project in some way. Smarty also connected me with Sisu mouthguards and we were able to get a new mouthguard donated for every set of kit we got at the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quad Skate Shop helped collect donations and sent them to the league in Beirut [&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Roller-Derby-Beirut-763063127094159/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roller Derby Beirut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]. During World Cup they offered a discount at the shop, if you donate an old item you get 10% off the new one, so bring in old wrist guards get 10% off your new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smarty has been working with me on several ways to make the project more accessible too. We started a league sponsorship program where her league did a collection and sponsored the shipping to the league in Cairo [&lt;a href="http://www.cairollers.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CaiRollers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jes Rivas has also reached out about supporting the project with donating some of her old items since she’s now retired and helping with social media blasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also connected with &lt;a href="https://www.doublethreatskates.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double Threat Skate Shop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in London and they’ve donated items and are continuing to collect items for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m so thankful and inspired for all the support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see Derby Without Borders growing bigger with time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. I think with a little more time and some work it can become something great that helps support people in the sport and increases accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's your "vision" for the project - do you want to support emerging derby in other ways, beyond just kit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had absolutely no boundaries on how the project could grow I would love to see it develop in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to get kit to beneficiaries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponsor experienced Coaches to host bootcamps for beneficiaries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host roller derby after-school programs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scholarship fund to get individuals from beneficiary leagues to large scale derby events such as Rollercon, Camp Elite and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If people want to help out with Derby Without Borders, how can they help out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything helps. At the moment I managing the whole project, but my skill set does not lie in logistics. The biggest things I need at the moment:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Website management/rebranding&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Social Media (both with managing the page but also just sharing posts so more people hear about it)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Logistics/Admin: organising beneficiaries, potential sponsors etc&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Shipping expert: anyone who knows a lot about international shipping and estimated costs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Charity/Nonprofit Management: I’d love to register the project as a charity&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Outreach: finding new beneficiaries and potential sponsors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What kinds of items of kit are most in demand - and how second-hand is second-hand?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely skates. Most people want to sell old skates to help offset the cost of buying a new pair, which is totally understandable. But skates are also the hardest thing for people to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-hand: meaning it has to be still safe for people to use. I’m not interested in putting people at risk. I always ask if helmet donations have taken any impact and don’t take helmets that have. As long as pads are relatively usable, even with some tape, I’ll take them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you don't have kit to donate, how else can people help out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest ways people can help are donating time, money or publicity. I can definitely use volunteers in a number of ways, both here in London and digitally from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial donations help cover shipping costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply spreading information about the project is really helpful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do want to donate to Derby Without Borders, you can do so via their &lt;a href="http://www.skatingoutofbounds.com/derby-without-borders/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/derbywithoutborders/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boasting an action packed day for both DRG's A and B team, doors open at &lt;strong&gt;12:30&lt;/strong&gt; with tickets on the day at &lt;strong&gt;£6.&lt;/strong&gt; You can look forward to &lt;em&gt;Fair City Rollers&lt;/em&gt;' Fear Maidens facing off against the Bonnie Colliders at 1pm, with &lt;em&gt;Auld Reekie Roller Girls&lt;/em&gt;' All Star Reserves taking the track against the Silvery Tayzers at 3pm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a new season of games, come new captains! So we thought we would have a wee chat with both teams' captains to see how the season is shaping up. First up is ALLY-J and Tiny Tearaway captaining the Bonnie Colliders!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt;Motto&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Lets do dis"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Nothing is impossible, the word itself says "I'm possible""&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt;How long have you been skating?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;I’ve been quad skating with DRG since March 2016, so 2 years now (time flies!) but used to inline skate from the age of 10!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;I have been skating 6 years this coming May (scary) and I have been with DRG for 2 years&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt;What does this season hold for the Colliders?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;We've had the opportunity of playing in Copenhagen, Newcastle and in our home town, and this season we're going to build as a whole Team! We totally found our feet working with each other, and we are looking at focusing on attendance, positivity and building our knowledge of the game!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Yes its going to be very exciting for the Colliders. We have some fantastic games lined up already and a strong team full of skaters determined to be the best.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt;As a B team, what challenges to you face?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Finding our way of working together as a team. Fitting in our newest skaters and helping them gain lots more skills and understanding of the game.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;We are all part of a very supportive league so the challenges I see aren’t limited to us as a team. We face the same challenges as the A team; attendance, working together well and pushing ourselves to the best of our abilities.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt;How does the league, as a whole, carve space for the B team?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;As a league, our A and B team train together, which is an amazing opportunity. We are constantly learning from each other, talking over drills and skills; with us skating alongside folk from Team Scotland, really being able to learn from the best is our greatest asset.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;B team, A team who? We're a league that trains together. Skaters for both teams, crossovers and new skaters. We all do the same drills and are expected to put the same amount of hard work and effort into every one from the newer skaters to those who were on Team Scotland.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt;And if you could set goals for yourself and for the team this season?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;My personal goal is to work on my jammer skills and tactical knowledge. I want to work well for the team and push myself this season! For the Colliders: to focus on ourselves as a team. Although we are all building our personal skills, I really want everyone to bring positivity and sportsmanship to the Colliders.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Our B team has played and flourished with smaller numbers the past season. It would be great to see us play with higher numbers. This would give us the chance to have a solid jammer rotation and walls that are to be reckoned with. To be part of that jammer rotation is my goal for this season.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Second up is the captains of the Silvery Tayzers, Seaton and Bosies!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt;Serelson&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt;Motto&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Shitemare"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"SITFU"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt;How long have you been skating?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;6 years, started and stayed with DRG since then.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Skating for six years, initially with GCRD and have been with DRG for almost 2 years&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt;What does this season hold for the Tayzers?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;I'll probably cry and give dramatic speeches alot. Hoping that as a league we'll be able to continue to perform like we did last season but also move passed that, honing in our skill set. The Tayzers have always performed under a "get the job done, nae fancy shit" mentality and I want to continue that while progressing within the WFTDA rankings.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;We are continuing to evolve the skills, tactics and endurance that we've developed last season. Which will set us in good stead for the exciting and tough games we have lined up for this year.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt;As an A team skater, how do you stay ontop of your game&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;I hydrate and then spew it up if I go too fast.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Pepsi Max, avocados and hummus. And cross training.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt;How has becoming a WFTDA league changed your priorities and training?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;I think it gives us clear global equivalents to try to compete against, which we haven't really had before. It's good to be able to feel super involved with the development of the sport as a whole, as well as having access to more teams.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;It allows us to skate against teams of a similar calibre at national and international level, as well as competing in tournaments! This emphasises the need for a strong mental game, the ability to work as a tight unit and to continue to function when the fatigue sets in!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt;And if you could set a goal for yourself and your team?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Finish a game without a spew or a cry, working on my mental game is a constant priority as well as my on track skills. As a team, I just want to end every game as a happy wee unit proud of what we have just done.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:justify;"&gt;My personal goal is the same as it was when I first started skating, which is to get lower! As a team if we can continue to work together, support each other on and off track and leave each game with a sense of achievement, then that's a job well done&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Since the first league started in Glasgow in 2007, Roller Derby has spread across the Nation - but not always uniformly, or consistently. Whilst there's certainly a lot of Roller Derby in Scotland now - with 19 leagues in existence (by one count) now - communication and organisation across the community has not always been as good as it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;October 7th&lt;/strong&gt;, in Edinburgh's Charteris Centre, three people aim to change this. Auld Reekie Roller Girls' Crazylegs and (Steph) Skinner, and Glasgow Roller Derby's head referee Candy Moho, are organising what they hope will be the first of a regular series of gatherings of the Scottish Roller Derby Community in one place and one time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-24409 aligncenter" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-13-at-16-17-08.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-09-13 at 16.17.08" width="335" height="315"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Big Blether&lt;/em&gt;, as it's now known, aims to bring together all of the extant leagues and clubs in Scotland, as well as others in the sport, in order to share and discuss the future and present of the sport. Every active league in Scotland has been invited to the event as part of the organisation process,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked to two-thirds of the Organisers - thrice Team Scotland skater,  founding Roller Derby Nations Committee rep, and founding Auld Reekie Roller Girls member, &lt;em&gt;Crazylegs&lt;/em&gt;; and long-standing Glasgow Roller Derby Head Referee and organiser of the Scottish Roller Derby Events Spreadsheet, &lt;em&gt;Candy Moho&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crazylegs was inspired to kickstart this idea at the last European Rollerderby Organisational Conference, as she told us. "I guess for me the inspiration came from EROC - I love attending that event, and I guess the more I go to events like that and attend sessions, and deliver talks,  I kind of think, we've got such a compact community in Scotland - and I don't think we take advantage of it enough.
Our league [ARRG] gets so much out of events like EROC in terms of knowledge and new ideas to refresh you. It's so much easier for us to get together in Scotland - the leagues in Australia might find it harder to all meet up, for example - but we're so close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chatted to Candy at the end of EROC, and she mentioned that she'd been thinking of something similar, so it was in my mind from then."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candy, meanwhile, had a slightly different perspective. "My main focus was the Officials side, off of the back of a project I'd done for the Open Uni. And also being in the Event Organising Group, the Interleague Liasion group, a lot of the issues there - it just seemed it would be easier to get people in the same room to talk to each other!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;One of the things I am planning to do at The Big Blether is to present the findings from my OU project, which focussed on Scottish Derby Officials - I've not had a chance to pass on the results of that to the community, and I thought this is the perfect forum to do it, and make the results public after. That took in feedback from Officials as well as skaters from leagues. A lot of the stuff from that is still very relevant, and it's relevant to UK officials as well."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Unlike EROC's speaker-centered sessions, The Big Blether is intended to foster a less hierarchical approach - each topic will have a "facilitator" to moderate, but will emphasise communication and discussion between peers, not a top-down dissemination of from on-high.&lt;/p&gt;
Topics on the agenda currently cover the spectrum of community concerns and interests, from best practice in Training, through the creation of better links for interleague support and with local communities, and how to move the sport on in terms of recognition on both local and National/International scales; however, in keeping with the design of the event, there are no topics which are out of bounds if attendees wish to discuss them.
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the organisers, again, they each have their own favourite areas from the menu presented. For Crazylegs, a key topic is governance and organisation, on all scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want to cover topics like League Governance - so: the legalities of how you set up a league, how you structure a league, what works for different leagues, of different sizes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;I guess leading on from that you'd look at&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; sports &lt;/span&gt;governance - as in governing bodies, as in the national teams, UKRDA, WFTDA [MRDA], just I think maybe putting a bit of information out there for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;I think there's a lot of myths out there concerning the various bodies - but we also need to talk about what Scotland itself needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;I know Stef's driving force for this comes from her job, she's a community sports officer, and she's been has been doing a lot of research around the growth of sport, how we can better use Sport Scotland, and have better links with them for funding and support. We were also discussing working on having clear pathways, to show people how they can get to where they want to go - if that's high level competition, or having fun - from where they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;And I think training as well - what support setups different leagues need, if we feel that there needs to be more information out there about training and structures, and how to set things up from beginning to getting wherever your league or team wants to go."&lt;/p&gt;
Candy, with her other hat on, is most concerned with another topic. "On the Events side: getting a Scottish Tournament (doing another "Highland Fling", perhaps) but also the topic of if we need to look into a League structure - as they have in Germany  and France. I think you tend to find that when you have that kind of structure, and people working well together, then you also drive the sport, and the level of competition as well. "
&lt;p&gt;But, most of all, the event is about everyone meeting up and building the community links that can make Scottish Derby stronger together. As Crazylegs notes, "having a relaxed chat to people that you don't know, but you've heard of their leagues - if you get that kind of face-to-face conversation with people you've only interacted with on social media, then you make better connections, and everyone learns something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue's amazing, it's close to town, we'll get some nice stuff going on in the breaks to build connections - and we'll be providing a delicious lunch!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically LeedsRD were new to Champs this time around, as this is their first year of competition. However, being formed from the merger of Leeds Roller Dolls and Hot Wheel Roller Derby, they have a lot of experienced skaters, and inherited LRD's position in Tier 1. The team were only just formed at the time of their first Champs games (and they are only just at the point of getting a new logo now), so this was always going to be a difficult competitive year for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-23291" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/08/20642312_1417657074969467_922557361_o.jpg?w=1024" alt="20642312_1417657074969467_922557361_o" width="1024" height="683"&gt; Leeds Roller Derby v Birmingham Blitz Dames Credit: Tallboy Images&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final fixture for the Tier 1 comes in a few weeks, on the 26th August, as LeedsRD face London Brawl Saints, as do Birmingham Blitz Dames; whilst Bristol Roller Derby take on the season's likely champions, Middlesbrough Roller Derby. Sadly, the adjustments needed within LeedsRD have left them at the bottom of the table to date, but the team is positive about their rate of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked to Leeds Roller Derby's A team co-captains, Nina and Lana Del Slay about their experience, and the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has Champs been for you?&lt;/strong&gt;
Nina: It's been brilliant! As a brand new team we knew that tier 1 was going to be tough, and it has been, but we've loved it. Our first game against Tiger Bay was on 26 February - less than 8 weeks after our first ever training session as Leeds Roller Derby - and we had some key skaters out with big injuries early on. Of course it would have been amazing to have gone out there and smashed it but these are some of the best and most established teams in the country and that just wasn't going to happen - we were under no illusions about that.
Lana: Back in February we said that our number one goal for the season was becoming a team, and we're really happy with how far we've come in just eight months. We've just announced our latest charter which we'll be choosing a roster for the Brawl Saints game from. We've played a few different skaters and there are a couple of new faces on this charter too. There's more and more competition for spots on the A team but also our B team too. It's exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What plans do you have post-Champs?&lt;/strong&gt;
Nina: Our B team is playing Croydon away in September, which we're looking forward to...
Lana: We're going to be celebrating 10 years of roller derby in Leeds in October which is a very big focus for us. There will be lots of events taking place to mark it, including the return of the Great Yorkshire Showdown, and we'll be unveiling our rebrand which we've all been working really hard on then too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23301" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/08/20615803_1417455691656272_79860269650687366_o.jpg" alt="20615803_1417455691656272_79860269650687366_o" width="1100" height="1100"&gt; The new LeedsRD A Team Roster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tier 1 Final: &lt;strong&gt;26 August&lt;/strong&gt;, Birmingham &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1444426895600235/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/1444426895600235/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Our team for Tier 2 North was &lt;a href="http://www.newcastlerollergirls.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newcastle Roller Girls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;' B-team, the Whippin Hinnies, who were one of three 3 B-teams added to British Champs this year. (London Rollergirls had led the charge the previous year, with the Brawl Saints competing in Tier 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-13711 aligncenter" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/01/newcastlerg_1.png" alt="newcastlerg_1" width="122" height="250"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend sees the final fixture in the Division, with Newcastle up against Wirral Roller Derby in &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/104769700121799/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manchester&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. With the Hinnies at the bottom spot currently, with Wirral just one place above them, this should be the closest bout of the tournament for them - SRDRank places them nigh-identically in ranking, whist FTS favours Wirral, but not much. At the top of the table, the other B team in the Division, Rainy City B (the Tender Hooligans) have a tight grip on the top spot, with Liverpool Roller Birds and hosts Manchester Roller Derby fighting it out for the second playoffs spot in the same event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked to Hinnies' Co-Captain, Ania Marx about their first Champs experience...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's been a tough Tier for the Hinnies' first Champs experience, so far, with teams like Rainy B in the mix. How has the experience been for the team - and what has it taught you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a challenge ​but we​ always​ knew it would be - being seeded last​ in our Tier against alongside some really strong teams​ and also being a B team​ means that we've also​ needed to absorb a number of charter changes as players move up to our A team​, the Canny Belters​​​,​​ but we're grateful for the opportunity to play at this level - we've learnt a lot and have thoroughly enjoyed the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With just one game left in the season, what are your plans for the post-Champs period...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll have a short break from ​competitive bouts but hope to fit in a few more before the end of the year - we'll update the fixtures page on our website as soon as we've got more games confirmed. Immediately after our last Champs game on the 5th Aug we​'ll definitely be let​ting​ our hair down and enjoy​ing​ the after party and hope all the other leagues will be doing the same​!​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...and your thoughts about Champs next year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a great opportunity for the Whippin' ​Hinnies which was only possible due to our A team​'​s ​WFTDA ranking and our own European ranking​ going into Champs​ - if we remain eligible​ as a B team​ we will seriously consider​ taking part​ next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As hinted at in the interview, whilst the Hinnies will be taking a break post-Champs, there's more happening with Newcastle in the coming months.
We'd keep our eyes peeled for an away game in August, as well as the return of the Hinnies (and the Canny Belters) later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

This one promises to be extra special, not only is this the first Brawlers game outside of Scotland BUT it's also the first Brawlers game outside of the U.K.! The Brawlers are heading to Tenerife to play against &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Tibicenas-Mens-Roller-Derby-796092177146242/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tibicenas Men's Roller Derby&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (TMRD).
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22166" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/07/img_0039.jpg" alt="" width="724" height="1024"&gt; Bout Poster courtesy of Tibicenas Men's Roller Derby&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to check  in with captains Pudz and Momo to ask about how the team are preparing for their next game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMRD have previously played Madrid MadRiders but despite some serious snooping, I can't find any teams to link GCB to TMRD. Since this makes it super hard to make any predictions about the game, there is additional excitement. [&lt;a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SRDRank&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gives the Brawlers the advantage over their hosts, but with low certainty - Ed.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You played Oldham earlier this year and were victorious, how are you feeling about taking on Tibicenas Men's Roller Derby? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have you seen them play before or met any of the players during your World Cup experiences?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pudz&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nervous but excited at the same time. We've scoured the internet for footage to watch but come up short so are going into this game a little bit blind as to our opponent's style. Unless you count their uploads of the T Rex on skates, if the dinosaur gets rostered we'll be facing a new challenge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Momo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We trained really hard on the run up to the Oldham game, I think we stepped up drastically from our previous game last year. We went back through the previous game and pin-pointed every weakness and focused heavily on certain aspects that were lacking; we're not perfect yet but the guys really worked hard and for the first time at the Oldham game we had in all sense's of the word: a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenerife is a complete wild card! None of us know what to expect from the team and I think a lot of the guys are underestimating how hot it's going to be; myself and Pudz have a good idea how hard it's going to be after playing in Canada [at MRDWC] last year. TMRD will have the advantage being used to playing in the heat, and I think we are only playing with 9* so it's going to be seriously tough. Whatever happens we'll do all we can do and have fun knowing we have a holiday after the game as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven't seen the roster yet and I'm not sure if anyone played in the World Cup but it's obviously quite possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*GCB will now be playing with 10 skaters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tell me about your fundraising efforts to get the team and crew over to Tenerife &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pudz&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five of our Brawlers are doing a sponsored leg wax to help cover the costs of skater insurance and the bus to the game in Tenerife. Whichever Brawler has the most money against their name will be getting a nice pre holiday leg wax. #waxonwaxbrawff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever has the highest funds against them is going to have an itchy time in the crazy heat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/07/img_0038-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22170" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/07/img_0038-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/waxonwaxbrawff"&gt;http://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/waxonwaxbrawff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What sort of special preparation are you doing as a team/individual for playing in such a super warm place?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pudz&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team have been doing "jumper scrims" in preparation for the game to try and adjust to the heat. These have been met with sad faces from our peely wally Brawlers but have been good fun and shown off Raffers' fine selection of Christmas Jumpers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also invited some guests to scrim against the Brawler Tenerife roster as a warm up which went very well. Our Brawlers' hard work is paying off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Momo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been training with jumpers on during scrims to help with heat training and our scrims are generally quite intense, almost "iron man" if you like, so it's good for the endurance, especially since we're playing with 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a scrim with the "Tenerife 9" vs the rest of the Brawlers, some GCRD members, and some Bairn City members last weekend, a good mixed bunch to help us prepare. They were great, totally mixed it up and they didn't take it easy on us! It went well and gave us a few more things to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How does preparation for an international game differ to preparing for a local game?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pudz&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to think about things like jet lag [not to Tenerife though! - Ed], lower roster numbers due to the distance travelled and, most importantly, the bar order; "Tres sidras por favor!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a team we are very excited to represent Scottish roller derby on an international scale, strengthening the roller derby community even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Momo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparing for Tenerife seems a lot more labour intensive from an organising point of view. If it wasn't for Nikki, Brawlers' Bench Manager, sorting the entire thing out I think we'd be walking from one end of the island to the other to get to the game. I did my bit as well though: I organised a rainbow of the best beach towels Scotland's ever seen! We're obviously doing our heat training and some of us have been working on our after party stamina to last the entire holiday, I guess maybe some of the guys have been working on their beach bods, not likely but maybe....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've lost a few skaters at the start of this year/ tail end of last year but we've gained some new young blood with loads of potential and honestly the Brawlers are the strongest we've ever been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're looking forward to what we have planned for the rest of 2017 and can't wait to see what 2018 brings!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A huge 'thank you' to Pudz and Momo for taking the time to answer my questions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, for one, am so excited for the first GCB international game and wish the team loads of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there's still time to donate and nominate your favourite brawler for a cheeky leg wax! &lt;a href="http://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/waxonwaxbrawff"&gt;http://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/waxonwaxbrawff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poland, despite having one of the largest populations in Central Europe, has only recently developed a significant Roller Derby population. We talked to one of Team Poland's organisers, Ewa Kaczyńska, about the formation of the National Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19856" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/06/screen-shot-2017-06-02-at-15-34-22.png?w=300" alt="Screen Shot 2017-06-02 at 15.34.22" width="300" height="188"&gt; The Polish Flag (standing in for Team Poland's logo)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Roller Derby having only come to Poland in 2013 - the first league in Poznań quickly followed by Warsaw, then Wrocław, Szczecin and Gdańsk - there was little possibility to compete in the 2014 World Cup. Since then, Polish Derby has grown considerably, to the point of holding their first &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1232048456872900/"&gt;Derby Sevens tournament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; this year, as well as hosting one of Scald Eagle &amp;amp; Lady Trample's &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1852698681626181/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WinTourOpe bootcamp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dates. Whilst not all the leagues are huge at the moment (there's a preference for mixed team events and scrims to cover the numbers for the smaller teams), Polish derby is still growing and in a strong position in the Central European vanguard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is often the case, inline skating is more popular in Poland than Quads, although, Ewa notes: "[interest in quad skates] is growing, here is a better access to quads in shops. However, not that much luck with roller derby related skate shops, as there are just 3 or 4 with limited offerings." It's perhaps the growth of Chicks in Bowls, which also has a Polish branch, which is helping to drive this interest, helping out Roller derby with the cross-over, as it does elsewhere. "Yes, they definitely [help]. It's good that girls are taking over the skateparks!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more derby related help, the community surrounding has been supportive, with bootcamps and shared bouts popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Thanks to skaters from all over the World we are able to organize bootcamps led by experienced coaches," Ewa told us. "That is so much different from learning from the book - as we did at first! 'Roller Derby 101: The Fresh Meat Training Manual ' was our first derby bible... Now, we get a lot of help and support from Czech and German teams - I guess it's just the thing with neighbours! &lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;We also get  lots of help from Polish (and other) skaters from all over the World.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the intent to participate applications opened for the 2018 World Cup,  Poland were actually the last team to sign up, as Ewa notes: "There’s been a discussion about founding Polish National Roller Derby Team going on since November 2016 in Poland. [...]No decisions were made until the very last moment before the registration period ended. We formed a Founding Committee and acted!
I think [the decision] was just about not letting people miss the opportunity to represent Poland."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ewa also had personal reasons for pushing for the decision to commit, "I believe that sometimes people need to be pushed a bit. Sometimes no decisions are made simply because of the lack of courage, or ability to take responsibility for one's actions. I started derby three years ago and I started it to compete later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;At first I thought that Polish skaters are not yet ready to compete on such level as World Cup. Since last November, we had numerous discussions with more experienced skaters. We got a lot of encouragement and support and then it suddenly became clear to us: t&lt;/span&gt;hings like forming a National Team need to be done to push things further, to make teams grow, to create opportunities for development. We cannot just sit doing nothing!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the last-minute decision, Poland's size and population have immediately produced results, with more than 50 skaters registered to try out or otherwise be involved, with around 50% from the existing Polish teams, and the rest from across the World. Poland has many nationals, and descendants of nationals, spread across the world - in Europe and in the USA - and many of them feel just as much pride for their country as those who live there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"After we decided to found Team Poland we got a massive response from other parts of the World, which is just amazing; [...] it is truly touching when we get messages from people that 'want to do it for their Grandpa', although we would [also] love Team Poland to have lots of Polish girls living in Poland!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for all National Teams, and especially the newer ones, Team Poland are driven by more than simply patriotism. With National teams comes the chance of better visibility for Roller Derby as well - and a chance to combat myths and prejudice. "What really pushed us to form TP is a bigger picture," explains Ewa. "We know that all the teams went the same way at the beginning: rented vintage skates, no proper protection, no coaches, no places to skate. Also most of people think about roller derby as of 'rugby on quads' or an aggressive sport for punk girls with piercings and tattoos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely, we do have them, but taking a part in such a big event could be an eye opener for people here! We would love them to acknowledge this sport as an athletic discipline, not only for 'outcasts'..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And part of growing that athletic image is, of course, better training. As we discussed with &lt;a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/04/26/team-austria-new-to-the-world-cup/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Austria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the advantage of  National Teams is also in the sharing of experience and skills, and Ewa agrees. "We all think that apart from World Cup, the following months will let us all benefit from the joined training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a big step for Polish roller derby, that's for sure!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
