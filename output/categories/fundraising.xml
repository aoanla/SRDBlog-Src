One of the recent great examples of the way the Roller Derby community can band together to support itself is the &lt;a href="http://www.skatingoutofbounds.com/derby-without-borders/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derby Without Borders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Project, which has been working to supply resources to Roller Derby leagues in need since last year.
As the project continues, we caught up with founder Mae Dae to find out where the project came from - and how you can help it to continue to help Roller Derby everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-26810 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/06/derbywithoutborders.png" alt="derbywithoutborders" width="600" height="400"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;So, for people who don't know you: let's start with "who's Mae Dae, and what is Skating Out of Bounds?"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I’m 28 years old and I love roller derby. I first started skating with a small league in Northern California, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://sonomacountyrollderby.org/"&gt;Sonoma County Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, in 2014. In 2017 I left my league, and home, to go on a back packing trip through Europe. I knew I couldn’t possibly live without derby in my life so I brought my skates with me. Skating Out of Bounds was originally a blog about my travel and derby experiences elsewhere. Mainly it was for my friends to read. I also would send people little care packages from different places I visited through the site as well. Since then, it’s evolved into something entirely different. I’ve actually deactivated the blog even, because it doesn’t feel relevant to it’s purpose anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we're here to talk about is something which started as a spinoff of Skating Out of Bounds - the Derby Without Borders project. I think the idea first came to you at the 2017 WFTDA &lt;a href="https://wftda.com/rdws/"&gt;World Summit&lt;/a&gt; in Manchester, so can you talk us through the background?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, at the Summit there was a panel of skaters from what were identified as “emerging regions” in derby. They all discussed different struggles they had with making derby accessible in their own leagues. One of the struggles that was universal was that for varying different reasons they all struggled with getting skates and protective gear. This is a huge barrier for the sport to grow in these areas as it can be so discouraging to wait months for skates to arrive. It was sort of a lightbulb moment and I chatted with several of the panellists after to see if they would somehow be interested in receiving some donations if I could get some together. I also chatted with Master Blaster there and she thought it was a great idea. I told her about my blog and travels so she said to come by her shop in Berlin and we could make it happen. She was the first of several people to believe in my idea, and well the rest all kind of fell into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derby Without Borders' first "concrete goal" was to provide kit to support &lt;a href="http://sailorcityrollers.com/"&gt;Sailor City Rollers &lt;/a&gt;in Argentina - for which you ran a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/derbywithoutborders"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; , as well as a stall at RollerCon. What was the support like for the project at RollerCon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t even expecting to have a booth at Rollercon to be honest. But I figured if I didn’t ask I wouldn’t so I emailed to see if they would be ok with me having a booth. I was so excited when they told me they’d donate a space to me! I think the support was great, people who heard about the project were happy to help and we got a considerable amount of donations. I struggled to get the information out to enough people ahead of time so there were a lot of people who had said they wished they had known sooner and they would have brought more donations with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you have any unexpected help, or setbacks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My neighbouring booth at Rollercon, F Yeah Printing, were so sweet and we made good friends! They have been so supportive since then and have offered a fundraiser through their printing service, [&lt;a href="https://fyeahprinting.com/collections/derby-without-borders"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;link]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where you can buy Skating Out of Bounds and Derby Without Borders merchandise and a portion of the proceeds go to helping fund the project. They’ve also been really helpful with sharing social media posts about the project which is a lot more helpful than people think!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t call them setbacks, but definitely some big learning moments. I had a bit of a mix up with travel plans at the end of Rollercon and had to leave mid day on Sunday. Which meant packing up the booth early. I didn’t think about it at the time, but of course, everyone wanted to leave donations at the end of the event. So even though the booth was packed up people still left quite a few donations behind. I definitely changed my approach for the World Cup booth because of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Following up on that, the project's next appearance was at the &lt;a href="http://www.rollerderbyworldcuplive.com/"&gt;Roller Derby World Cup 2018&lt;/a&gt;, back in Manchester. As well as passing on the kit the project had collected for Sailor City to Team Argentina's skaters, you extended the project to a huge number of other teams - can you tell us a bit about the current beneficiaries, and how they were selected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure! So I already had a contact with &lt;a href="http://goldencityrollers.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Golden City&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [Johannesburg] in South Africa and knew that Team South Africa would be at the World Cup so it made sense to collect for them too. Everything we collected at the World Cup went with them, and the Rollercon donations got passed on to the Team Argentina skaters from Sailor City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the other beneficiaries have been through word of mouth for the most part. Either friends of mine have mentioned a league somewhere and I’ve reached out, or leagues in need have heard of the project and reached out to me directly. Our list keeps growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26811" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/06/miraclewhipsdwb.jpg" alt="MiracleWhipsDWB" width="960" height="720"&gt; Team Canada's Miracle Whips hanging out by the Derby Without Borders stall at the Roller Derby World Cup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running Derby without Borders must be a big logistical task. Can you tell us who is currently involved in the project with you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be completely lost without all the help I’ve gotten so far. I’ve had tons of friends help out in all kinds of ways. Two of my former league mates, WiFly and H.A.M. Slice, helped design my two logos, and I had amazing volunteers at both booths. My two closest friends, KT Wrecks and Leethal, have also been amazing cheerleaders and sounding boards for the project since it started. I also had to work out some serious logistics for getting the Rollercon donations from my storage unit in California to Manchester for the World Cup. That was a combination of a good friend, Wicked Lizard, driving my donations to an event she was reffing at and Pia Mess, who would be coming to World Cup, picking them up from her and then me paying for an additional checked bag to get them there. Totally doable, but a lot of figuring out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my closest friends in London, Jem, has been a cornerstone for me since re-igniting the project here. She’s helped out a lot with planning, the booth at the World Cup, helping transport donations and being supportive of the project even when I feel like giving up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current league mates at &lt;a href="http://www.londonrockinrollers.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;London Rockin’ Rollers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have donated tons of items and quite a few volunteered at the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been so grateful for the support of Master Blaster and Smarty Pants. They’ve both been really supportive and have offered several resources throughout the whole project. Both &lt;a href="http://www.quadrollerskateshop.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quad Skate Shop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://strongathletic.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Athletic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have sponsored the project in some way. Smarty also connected me with Sisu mouthguards and we were able to get a new mouthguard donated for every set of kit we got at the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quad Skate Shop helped collect donations and sent them to the league in Beirut [&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Roller-Derby-Beirut-763063127094159/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roller Derby Beirut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]. During World Cup they offered a discount at the shop, if you donate an old item you get 10% off the new one, so bring in old wrist guards get 10% off your new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smarty has been working with me on several ways to make the project more accessible too. We started a league sponsorship program where her league did a collection and sponsored the shipping to the league in Cairo [&lt;a href="http://www.cairollers.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CaiRollers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jes Rivas has also reached out about supporting the project with donating some of her old items since she’s now retired and helping with social media blasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also connected with &lt;a href="https://www.doublethreatskates.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double Threat Skate Shop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in London and they’ve donated items and are continuing to collect items for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m so thankful and inspired for all the support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see Derby Without Borders growing bigger with time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. I think with a little more time and some work it can become something great that helps support people in the sport and increases accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's your "vision" for the project - do you want to support emerging derby in other ways, beyond just kit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had absolutely no boundaries on how the project could grow I would love to see it develop in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to get kit to beneficiaries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponsor experienced Coaches to host bootcamps for beneficiaries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host roller derby after-school programs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scholarship fund to get individuals from beneficiary leagues to large scale derby events such as Rollercon, Camp Elite and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If people want to help out with Derby Without Borders, how can they help out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything helps. At the moment I managing the whole project, but my skill set does not lie in logistics. The biggest things I need at the moment:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Website management/rebranding&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Social Media (both with managing the page but also just sharing posts so more people hear about it)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Logistics/Admin: organising beneficiaries, potential sponsors etc&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Shipping expert: anyone who knows a lot about international shipping and estimated costs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Charity/Nonprofit Management: I’d love to register the project as a charity&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Outreach: finding new beneficiaries and potential sponsors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What kinds of items of kit are most in demand - and how second-hand is second-hand?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely skates. Most people want to sell old skates to help offset the cost of buying a new pair, which is totally understandable. But skates are also the hardest thing for people to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-hand: meaning it has to be still safe for people to use. I’m not interested in putting people at risk. I always ask if helmet donations have taken any impact and don’t take helmets that have. As long as pads are relatively usable, even with some tape, I’ll take them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you don't have kit to donate, how else can people help out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest ways people can help are donating time, money or publicity. I can definitely use volunteers in a number of ways, both here in London and digitally from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial donations help cover shipping costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply spreading information about the project is really helpful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do want to donate to Derby Without Borders, you can do so via their &lt;a href="http://www.skatingoutofbounds.com/derby-without-borders/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/derbywithoutborders/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donations of funds can be made via the store at Skating Out Of Bounds: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skatingoutofbounds.com/shop/sponsor-a-league"&gt;SPONSOR A LEAGUE &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mae Dae and Derby Without Borders can be contacted to offer other kinds of help via their Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>a chat with...</category><category>articles</category><category>derby without borders</category><category>fundraising</category><category>fundraising events</category><category>international derby</category><category>interviews</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/06/05/derby-without-borders-an-interview-with-founder-mae-dae/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2018 19:36:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Team Scotland Events: Fundraiser coming to a close!</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/09/06/team-scotland-events-fundraiser-coming-to-a-close/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While over on Facebook, we've been regularly sharing info about the preparations for the various National Teams heading for the two Roller Derby World Cups next year... we've been saving a blog post for the Scottish National teams, starting with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Team-Scotland-Roller-Derby-235701999922927/"&gt;Team Scotland Roller Derby.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-13779 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/01/scotland.png" alt="scotland" width="200" height="200"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In common with many of the teams heading for the 3rd Roller Derby World Cup in Trafford, England, Team Scotland are &lt;a href="https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/team-scotland-roller-derby/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;raising money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to support their attendance. (Being a National Team has all the costs you would expect, from training venues, equipment, travel and accommodation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a special consideration this time around, &lt;strong&gt;20%&lt;/strong&gt; of the funds raised by TS will be donated to the charity &lt;strong&gt;Mind&lt;/strong&gt;, in support of mental health - and if you feel like you need a more tangible personal benefit for donating, all donations above &lt;strong&gt;£5&lt;/strong&gt; are eligible for Team Scotland branded merch, with donations above &lt;strong&gt;£75&lt;/strong&gt; enabling you to sponsor a specific Team Scotland Rostered Skater (who will wear a sponsors patch provided, during the World Cup).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have just until the &lt;strong&gt;11th&lt;/strong&gt; to donate to the fundraiser, and help it reach its goal of just £2000, so please consider donating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donation link is here: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/team-scotland-roller-derby/"&gt;https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/team-scotland-roller-derby/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in competing with Team Scotland, as well as supporting them, there's also the opportunity still to sign up as part of the mash-up team who will get to scrim against TS at their November training session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up in the Manhattan Works venue (Dundee Roller Girls' training venue), you will get to play with the best skaters that Scotland has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still time to sign up here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/111479986185051/?"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/111479986185051/?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, if you'd like to help Team Scotland, rather than compete against them, applications are now open for the position of "Team Sports Therapist" attending the team for their training sessions, and competition, including the World Cup itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apply here: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScwqegWr0F1-lAoO0hrXqrFLDx-fi1ueSwz7K9wZP4D3HugcA/viewform"&gt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScwqegWr0F1-lAoO0hrXqrFLDx-fi1ueSwz7K9wZP4D3HugcA/viewform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on in the Year, Team Scotland will be making appearances at a few other events, so stay tuned to see how you can catch them on track before the World Cup!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>crowdfunding</category><category>fundraising</category><category>fundraising events</category><category>roller derby world cup</category><category>team scotland</category><category>team scotland roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/09/06/team-scotland-events-fundraiser-coming-to-a-close/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2017 14:13:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Power of Scotland's Assistant Coach: Rosie Peacock</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/02/27/power-of-scotlands-assistant-coach-rosie-peacock/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Caley Kapowski &lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/02/15/power-of-scotland-fundraising-for-calgary/"&gt;reported for the blog&lt;/a&gt;, Scottish Men's National Team, Power of Scotland, are going all out to raise money for the trip to Calgary for the second ever Men's Roller Derby World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One member of the Power of Scotland Team who has recently started her own fundraising endeavour is new Assistant Coach, &lt;strong&gt;Rosie Peacock&lt;/strong&gt;. As she's offering roller derby coaching, we caught up with her to talk a bit about her coaching experience, and what she's offering for those who may be interested. Rosie is also currently on &lt;a href="http://arrg.co.uk/teams/allstars/"&gt;Auld Reekie Roller Girls All-Stars&lt;/a&gt; roster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before we start talking about Power of Scotland specifically, we should start by spending a bit of time just to introduce you yourself...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm not sure there's a lot of time I could spend on it. I've been playing roller derby for 5 years; started off with Nottingham Hellfire Harlots. Just before Team England tryouts first time around, I had a knee operation, so I was out for that, which was gutting. Then coaching for probably the last 4 years; been all around the UK coaching on different levels - from professional through to National teams. There's not a lot interesting about me.
I like the fact that, in roller derby, you do not have to look like what society determines is an "athletic body" to be really good at this sport. And I like the fact that the fact that I've got really short stature and a really big arse and yet seem to be able to perform at a really high level, seems to give a lot of people quite a lot of hope.
&lt;p&gt;Also, I've been part of Team Metal Legs, which is for people who've been injured playing roller derby and forced to be off-skates for 3 months or more. We've done a lot of work, and that's just trying to build people's physical and mental confidence back up, after pretty traumatic breaks.
And that's been a lot of fun to do as well.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; And a lot of people seem to like you, too: you won the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/talkderby/"&gt;Talk Derby To Me&lt;/a&gt; [Podcast] "Personality" award for 2015.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Oh, yeah. [embarrassed chuckle] That's, that's, right…
So, I used to come up to Edinburgh a lot to visit, because I went to Uni here and it's where I met my husband, but then moved down to Nottingham, and then discovered roller derby. But I used to come back up, and when I did, I'd go and skate with my brother [Deathworm Jim], who used to skate for Capital City [Roller Derby]. (I'm still trying to persuade him to come back!)
&lt;p&gt;But I remember coming up for a scrim, and it was my first scrim back after my knee operation, and there was this massive guy, that looked like a Viking, looking quite nervous. [laughs] It was his first ever scrim. And that was, now Power of Scotland skater, Optimus Grime. I could just see so much potential in him, and rightly so, he's an incredible skater, puts in incredible hard work as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, he seems to be quite fond of me, which is really nice because it's nice to have someone who's that cool who's on your side.
He and Marryk [Talk Derby To Me co-host King Crazy] have been [inaudible] for quite a long time, we've announced together a few times, yeah, and I think because those guys… I think Grime nominated me and then Marryk's obviously quite fond of me too. (I don't know why! Maybe it's because I baked cookies for him one time!).
But [winning the award] was really amazing, actually, I had a little cry about that. Don't tell anyone, but yeah.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, coming back to Power of Scotland, you fairly recently became Assistant Coach. How has that experience been?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, due to life pressures happening for a couple of the other Power of Scotland guys, I'm now Assistant Coach, which is [long pause] &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;So, I get to see these guys progress, from tryouts to gelling as a team, and really starting to hone in on some of the tactics and bring it together as a unit. Because they're all, as individuals, enormously talented guys, but I think the key for these National teams is to get the team working together as a unit. These guys will all be the best skaters in their home leagues, and used to fulfilling certain roles within their home leagues, but within the Power of Scotland unit, you know, they very much need to learn to trust one another as a unit. Which is a challenge when you're used to being the guy who's maybe the last one, the last line of defence, or the jammer who doesn't need to take offence. When you're going to be playing Team USA, then you're going to be needing some offence!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's hard to emphasise how important this is for a National team in particular - "top dogs playing together", some of whom aren't domiciled in Scotland, who need to adjust to the different context.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Definitely. It's definitely a challenge. I think it's a big transition mentally, as well, for a lot of the guys, because, I mean, the guys who are based within Scottish leagues all know each other quite well. Scottish Roller Derby is quite a small community, although it's growing all the time, it's still concentrated relatively around Falkirk/Glasgow /Edinburgh/Dundee; Aberdeen being probably the furthest away of the Big Leagues that I'm aware of.
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, there's guys obviously eligible for tryouts from down in London, all kinds of leagues, and actually, those guys have gelled in really really well. It's really good - but I think it is a bit of a mindset change, because going from being possibly the best one or two guys in the league and being in a probably one-off-one-on kind of rotation to perhaps being in a one-in-three or whatever, that's a bit of an adjustment too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing personalities, the "superstars"?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, I love roller derby because, you can be a superstar but you will never be as good as four or five guys who are working together. And I tend to find that, overall, the superstar, or the, I guess not "superstars"  [because] for me, those are the guys who tend to be incredibly incredibly talented and skilled, but are also capable of being part of that unit. I guess the guys who are flashy, and do this stuff as an individual...
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ah, the glory hounds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;uhuh, uhuh. They get to a certain level of competition, and then they peter out. Because they find it difficult to put their desire to outperform their teammates, if they can't put that to one side, and use their skills to support their team and be part of that unit. Sometimes that means that you don't "look" very good, because you're the guy who's just standing in a wall, and everybody's like "what are you doing", but actually you're doing a really important job here! Those guys tend not to make it to this level of competition, I think purely because you know it's that, you can be the Stef Mainey of Roller Derby, but if you're not working as part of a team, the other four guys are gonna render you redundant.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And of course, "The Stef Mainey" of Roller Derby is a very strong team player herself!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Exactly, exactly!
I think sometimes [teams say] "if someone's not good at doing this, we'll put them as a jammer, because jammers don't work together". But Jammers don't work on their own - you can't have effective team offence if the jammers aren't working with the rest of the team to make it happen. So, the days of "oh, it's okay that they have a massive ego, we'll just stick them onto jam", those are long gone!
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, you will be travelling to Calgary, the rest of the Team will be travelling to Calgary…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes! I haven't actually been able to pay for a ticket yet - I think because I stepped in relatively late on; I was part of the selection committee, but then took a step back, and it's only recently that I've stepped up into the Assistant Coach role. So I haven't actually had a chance to save any money, or plan, or prepare, at all. [laughs] So I am in a bit of a frantic frenzy of fundraising - not for myself, but for the Power of Scotland travel pot.
&lt;p&gt;The way that PoS are running it, is that there's an expectation that everyone will be doing something to fundraise, and if you've managed to raise £50 or £500 is irrelevant, it's about the effort that we're putting in as a team, to try and help one another with the cost of just getting over there and back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a bit late to the party, so I've got a bit of time to make up for that now!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power of Scotland are, themselves, offering Power of Scotland guest coaching as a fundraising approach (&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ayrshire-Roller-Derby-Official-618921518215712/"&gt;Ayrshire Roller Derby &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/DoonhameDerbyDolls/"&gt;Doonhame Derby Dolls&lt;/a&gt; both recently benefitted from this, for example). I guess that your coaching initiative is in addition to this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, I dunno, I'm like that jumper that you kind of only put on when you need something to put on, but it's still kinda comfy. [chuckles]
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know you don't like bigging yourself up too much, but we should say that you are a rather experienced coach!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Oh, my goodness. Okay, so , I guess, I can't even remember all of the leagues I've coached - and that sounds like I'm being an absolute dick but I honestly, I can't. But I've coached quite a lot around the Midlands; I've done a couple of bootcamps for some of the Northern English teams.
&lt;p&gt;Generally the newer teams starting out tend to be looking for guest coaches a lot more. Erm, because you can get to a certain level, with watching footage and coming up with stuff yourself, but then eventually you do want someone that's perhaps got a bit more experience to come and inject a few new ideas and kindof...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, recently we had [WFTDA #2 Ranked Victorian Roller Derby League's] Lorrae Adams &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/953866961316282/"&gt;come over to ARRG&lt;/a&gt;. My mind was blown, it was like: "wow, I can use my shoulders!" I guess I've never used my shoulders in Roller Derby because my hips are so much wider; every time I try and come in with a shoulder, it's a bit pointless - my bum's already there! But she really opened my eyes to a whole different array of ways to use my body to make people fall over, which was great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think, sometimes, passing that information on to other leagues, but in a way that works for them, is really crucial. I don't come in and just coach what I like to do! I ask the league what they're looking for, ask them if they've got any footage to get an idea of where they're at, and what the next steps for progress would be, and to make sure it's stuff that's going to work for them, drills they can take away and make their own, and develop. Rather than coming in and being all like "this is how I play roller derby, so everyone should play roller derby this way".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[For example], a lot of leagues will be doing different kinds of defensive wall now. In Scotland, people are predominantly, I think, using the braced three-wall with a sort of spare-guy. But perhaps elsewhere, you'll see a lot more of the cube-walls, and rotational walls, happening. So it's really important as a coach to understand and be able to coach all these things, whether your home league uses them or not.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So far you've talked about experiences with Women's derby, but we should say thay you've skated Coed with guys on track a lot too...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, I love Coed. I absolutely ... I would love if Coed had the same sort of competitive structure that WFTDA has. I actually think it's (don't tell anyone), I think it's a lot more &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; because you can really take advantage of the different body shapes and physicality of it all. I'm more of a thinky kind of skater, so rather than being particularly strong or particularly fast, I'll think about how to use somebody else's style as a way to knock them off balance, or control them, or frustrate them. I love Coed, because it's just something underestimated as an approach.
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, so I've done load of these kind of fun [events], like Last Action Hero, SciFight, just generally, if there's an opportunity to play any kind of high level Coed, I'll want to be there. We're defending our championship titles for SciFight this year as well, so that's Game On!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I guess it's inevitable that Coed experience involves lots of exhibition teams; there's not a lot of permanent teams (although that's changing, especially in Scotland!). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, so its understanding that, yes, there are differences in body dynamics that need to be accounted for [between men and women], but not overly focussed on. There used to be this thing of "well, girls block with their hips and boys block with their shoulders", and, although generally speaking men tend to have broader shoulders and their centre of gravity tends to be higher up, whereas women tend to have wider-set hips, and their weight tends to be lower down towards their hips level, that's absolutely not the absolute rule.
&lt;p&gt;There's loads of guys - there's a couple, [for example] Alan [Watt] in Power of Scotland who is an incredible blocker with his hips. And it really annoys me actually when people say "Oh, he blocks like a girl!", because, no, he blocks like an &lt;em&gt;incredible skater&lt;/em&gt;, gender has nothing to do with it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there's teammates that I've skated with that their shoulders are much broader than their hips, and they've got incredible power in their shoulders.
So, I would love it if it got to the stage where gender just didn't matter in roller derby. If it was "so, this is the team from [say] Manchester", and it's the team of the best skaters in Manchester, and how they identify in terms of their gender, or what their organs are, has no relevance. That's what I'd really like to see.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender policies and feelings about this are changing, though. For example, the UKRDA gender policy was an early leader in this kind of thing (before WFTDA themselves updated a bit).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;I really like the way MRDA is heading, in terms of "actually, you don't have to specify a gender, you just can't be a female skating on a female league, and also an MRDA member league".
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;They just need to drop the 'M' from MRDA…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah. I know that Mean City in Glasgow have taken quite a lot of positive steps in terms of starting off as a Men's League, I guess in answer to the fact that there was only a female league set up at the time [Glasgow Roller Derby]. And now they've got to the stage where they're "actually, we don't care how you identify, we want you to come and skate with us, we want you to be the best you can be". And I really like that.
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and a lot of the newer leagues in Scotland are defaulting to Coed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, and I guess in terms of the higher ranked teams, there's going to be that decision in terms of well, in terms of Rankings, a lot of it is done in terms of the WFTDA, which does have a more stringent gender policy, whether you agree with it or not, so it's "Women's Flat Track Roller Derby", and that is currently the primary Ranking System for the top level teams.
&lt;p&gt;So, it's like "wouldn't it be nice if we could see WFTDA and MRDA merge to 'RDA', and [have] that ranking system take off, and make that conscious decision to stop caring about gender, in terms of athletic ability".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying gender's not important to people on an individual basis - of course it is - but in terms of having an impact on someone's ability to perform in a sport, I think it's absolutely irrelevant.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sure, I think there's probably still sports where there's a genuine gender gap (powerlifting, for example), although they do tend to be narrowing over time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, and I think [in roller derby], the wheels are the great equaliser. You can be as big and strong as you like, but someone half your weight and a slip of a thing can out-manoeuvre you, and you're done.
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And you get lighter guys too, it's not just "Big Men versus Small Women". Jim Whyte, on PoS, is a pretty lightly built guy, but he does great things on track.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, and he's a fantastic blocker. I know he does a lot of jamming, because he is so incredibly skilled on his feet, but you know, I've made the mistake in games of thinking, "ahh, weight ratios, I'll take him on his chest, it'll be fine!" And it's not fine! He's really good at assessing the angle that someone's coming in at, and counter-leaning really well.
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This seems like a good place to start wrapping up; is there anything you'd like to particularly emphasise to the readers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;So, yes, I'm just really keen to get out and.. I've taken a little bit of a break from coaching, because of the move from Nottingham up to Edinburgh, and that's taken a bit of a transition, and I've been kind of focussing on getting used to the way that things are done at ARRG, because on joining any new league there's a transition experience in terms of tactics and things. But, yeah, I just really miss coaching, I would really like to get out, try and spread the Derby Love to some other teams.
&lt;p&gt;There's quite a lot of weekends between now, and July 20th, which is when we fly out, some of them are already pretty fully booked, but there's lots of weekends free.
And I'm doing quite a lot of travelling anyway, so hopefully, I can book things in when I'm already in the local area.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You could even try to get in some coaching when you're over at the Big O with Auld Reekie!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, ARRG are in as one of the lowest (WFTDA) ranked teams in the tournament, so that's going to be an amazing challenge. I can't see Rose City saying, "Hey, come over any coach us!". [laughs] That would be amazing, but no.
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Sure, but there's tons of smaller leagues in the USA too. Just like US skaters have basically just heard of London Rollergirls; skaters in the UK only hear about the big leagues in the USA. You don't see the smaller, just as interesting, leagues from the distance...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, yeah, I hadn't thought of it that way!
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scottish Men's National Roller Derby Team, Power of Scotland, are off to Calgary next year to compete in the second Men's Roller Derby World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(They're also off to the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/4NRDC/"&gt;4Nations&lt;/a&gt; tournament this weekend, to play against France, Wales and England, which we'll have some reporting about after the event.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In support of their expenses in travelling across the Atlantic to represent their country, Power of Scotland have planned a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/432571486927246/"&gt;packed fundraising event&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;strong&gt;13th&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;December &lt;/strong&gt;on the theme of "Beards, Brains and Brainpower".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "beards" component will be represented by the result of the &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/posbestbeard"&gt;Sponsored Beard Shave&lt;/a&gt; contest. Three Power of Scotland more hirsute skaters - Bairn City's rEd Baron, Wirral's 12 Gauge and Mean City's Optimus Grime - have been competing to collect sponsorship funds. At this fundraiser, the skater with the least funds raised will be professionally shorn of their carefully tended facial hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the "brains" component is provided by a Team Quiz Night, featuring multiple rounds and multiple prizes. Teams are limited to 5 people. The quizmaster, Alan Muir, has been working hard on fiendish practical puzzlers, so we anticipate a challenging event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the "beers" element is provided by the host venue, &lt;strong&gt;The Raven&lt;/strong&gt;, at &lt;strong&gt;81-85 Renfield Street, Glasgow&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night of fundraising will start at &lt;strong&gt;18:45.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fundraiser event</category><category>fundraising</category><category>fundraising events</category><category>men's roller derby</category><category>power of scotland</category><category>team scotland</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/11/24/shear-brilliance-fundraising-for-power-of-scotland/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2015 11:40:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Capital City crowdfund to help put on their first bout</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/09/25/capital-city-crowdfund-for-first-bout/</link><dc:creator>despicablev</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we all know putting on a bout can be a very costly venture for any league especially when it comes to your first. So when Capital City announced last month that they would be hosting their first home bout they were a little nervous. Being a relatively small league (around 14 members), they know only too well how difficult it can be bringing in enough money to cover costs. So they have come up with a novel way to help raise the funds they need to put on their double header bout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a first for Scottish roller derby, they are looking to crowdfund for their bout to help raise money ahead of the big day. The aim is to raise money to help cover the majority of costs that need to be paid ahead of the bout, which breakdown as:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Meadowbank Hall Hire: £930&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Public Liability Insurance: £200&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Emergency Medical Technicians: £100&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Track Rope and Tape: £100&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Programme Printing: £50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Over on their crowdfunding page they allow you to pre order items such as bout tickets and merch (t-shirts/caps/tote bags) along with some more special one off items, such as picking a song on the bout day playlist, blowing the first whistle for the game, getting your very own Capital City Uniform and much more. They have even auctioned off their skate out song which was snapped up only minutes after their campaign went live.
&lt;p&gt;Purchasing items help items Capital City put on their bout, but it will also save you money. As bout tickets and merch are cheaper for those who pre-order than they will be on the day as a thank you to those helping them. You will have to be quick as you can only purchase items until the 1st of November when their crowdfunding campaign ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to pre-order your tickets or are feeling a little flush with cash and want to buy some other things then head over to their crowdfunding page at indiegogo via the link below to find out details of all the things on offer:
