&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/09/bump-her-sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-2939" alt="Bump-Her Stick-Her!" src="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/09/bump-her-sm.jpg?w=614" width="614" height="909"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Bump-Her Stick-Her!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What first attracted you to Roller Derby?&lt;/strong&gt;
My awesome bestie used to play for ARRG (Bobscene Behaviour) and that was my introduction to the game. I watched her in her first bout and left wishing I could give it a try. Fast forwards a few years later and I was a new mum looking for an outlet, some exercise and something that I could do just for me - I saw an advert for New Town Roller Girls and pounced!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most skaters have inspirations in their own or other leagues. Who are your derby heroes?&lt;/strong&gt;
Bobscene Behavior for introducing me to roller derby (and blocking like a boss). Duke Box is amazing, agile and hits like a wall! Also Lois Maim is all round awesome and so patient when helping me learn hits and blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when you're starting out. How did you choose your name (and number), and does it reflect your personality on track?&lt;/strong&gt;
It came to me at work. I'm generally known for being shy and uncertain (unless you really know me well) . I wanted to channel a tougher side so I wanted an aggressive name. Bump-Her Stick-Her is a mantra i can use on track. My number is my daughter Roslyn's birthday 195.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's your favourite position and technique?&lt;/strong&gt;
I like jamming, I am still learning a lot but I hope I can be a useful jammer some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word?&lt;/strong&gt;
Facebook :) work, rambling on to hairdressers and by wearing my teams t-shirt whilst running or working out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the most important thing you've learnt/ done this month&lt;/strong&gt;
Practicing with the boys and girls for our &lt;a title="Bairn City Rollers presents “Day Of Reckoning”" href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/09/10/bairn-city-rollers-presents-day-of-reckoning/"&gt;upcoming bout&lt;/a&gt; (my cherry popper)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the most difficult and the best things?&lt;/strong&gt;
The most difficult is the frustration of not picking up a technique. The best is the first time you get it right. You may not always get it but you realise it's possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's new for the New Town this month?&lt;/strong&gt;
First bout. I'm simultaneously excited and terrified. Also the next wave of minimum skills skaters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>monthly diary</category><category>new town roller girls</category><category>ntrg</category><guid>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/09/13/monthly-diary-of-a-league-new-town-in-september-bump-her-stick-her/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2013 09:40:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Monthly Diary of a League: New Town in August: Devil Drives'er</title><link>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/08/16/monthly-diary-of-a-league-new-town-in-august-devil-driveser/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing our regular coverage of Livingston's Finest Roller Derby League, here's &lt;a href="http://newtownrollergirls.tumblr.com/"&gt;New Town&lt;/a&gt;'s next monthly diarist: Devil Drives'er!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/08/leona-headshot.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-2892 " alt="Devil Drives'er!" src="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/08/leona-headshot.jpg" width="473" height="768"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Devil Drives'er!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-
&lt;strong&gt;What first attracted you to Roller Derby?&lt;/strong&gt;
I loved skating as a kid with weekends at the rollerina, and saw posters for AARG years ago which got my attention but after awhile kinda forgot about it. I was talking about it with one of my friends who told me that a league had started in Livingston and knew Hazzard. from there I just knew I had to get involved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most skaters have inspirations in their own or other leagues. Who are your derby heroes?&lt;/strong&gt;
I'd have to say Teenie Bash from ARRG since she got my little girl hooked after giving her a giant foam finger :P and from my own league Nettie Napalm and Bump-Her Stick-Her, because being mummies and working is hard enough to fit into a week, and your determination and drive at derby inspires me to do as well as you guys are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when you're starting out. How did you choose your name (and number), and does it reflect your personality on track?&lt;/strong&gt;
My name comes from one of my fave bands devildriver, and I chose number 13 because it may be unlucky for some but it's my favourite number, and I already have it tattooed on my arm so that's handy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's your favourite position and technique?&lt;/strong&gt;
Blocking, using my ass-ets ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word?&lt;/strong&gt;
I think I pretty much talk about it constantly! I've been flyering in work and in my local pub, as well as fundraising with the league and of course wearing my hoodie constantly for advertising!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the most important thing you've learnt/ done this month?&lt;/strong&gt;
To make sure I concentrate on my pacing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the most difficult and the best things?&lt;/strong&gt;
I'd say learning to get on with it when you feel rubbish, and getting used to my weird new lump in my arm :P. And as for best getting faster and closer to being mins passed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's new for the New Town this month?&lt;/strong&gt;
Our article in the Konect, and trying to sort out some extra skatey days :D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>interviews</category><category>monthly diary</category><category>new town roller girls</category><category>ntrg</category><guid>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/08/16/monthly-diary-of-a-league-new-town-in-august-devil-driveser/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2013 14:52:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Monthly Diary of a League: (New) New Town Roller Girls in July: Hazzard</title><link>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/07/12/monthly-diary-of-a-league-new-new-town-roller-girls-in-july-hazzard/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because we've been a little uneven with some of the monthly diaries recently, today marks not only a special event in the Blog's history (more on that later), but also a new regular source of monthly diaries: Livingston's own &lt;a href="http://newtownrollergirls.tumblr.com/"&gt;New Town Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt;. If you're in Dundee tomorrow, you'll see our first diarist for the league on track as part of the mixed cherry pop bout, presumably showing off her Spectre training... it's league founder Hazzard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/07/hazel-headshot-thm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-2815 " alt="Hazzard, in the New Town Alternate Kit" src="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/07/hazel-headshot-thm.jpg?w=614" width="491" height="738"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Hazzard, in the New Town Alternate Kit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What first attracted you to Roller Derby?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What didn't! It was fast paced, on skates and looked a helluva lot of fun! That and I watched Whip It then after some intensive googling went to see Team Scotland play as they made their way to the first derby world cup and fell in love even more with the massively talented skaters. And, of course, I wanted in on that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most skaters have inspirations in their own or other leagues. Who are your derby heroes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the girls in New Town that have stuck it out and give it their all each week at training. They make me want to push them harder in to awesome derby players so they can enjoy the sport to its fullest!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out with my league I adore Kamikaze Kitten of the London Roller Girls! (All of the LRG players are amazing though..) Kami has always stood out to me as a skater and a personality within derby. Her skating style and ability makes me super envious but it's something I want to emulate within myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her determination seems like it has no bounds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also really like Re-AnimateHer! She also has great skating ability and I've heard her coaching skills are amazing too. She's just a badass!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when you're starting out. How did you choose your name (and number), and does it reflect your personality on track?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name kind of came about from a work nickname. I was trying to find something at the time that reflected me and my personality. I am always managing to hurt myself or trip myself up in and out of work and coupled with the fact I do a lot of Health &amp;amp; Safety stuff in work in just stuck! (Plus I really like the letter 'z' so that's why there's 2 in there!) On track it depicts the fact I could be skating around quite leisurely and then end up tripping myself up. Which happens fairly often at training!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My number is from the Mass Effect series of games. It's hard coming up with a number that means something to you I found so I started looking for numbers in games and N7 just seemed like the most bad ass one I could find! Plus I'd love to look as awesome as femShep on track!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's your favourite position and technique?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I've bouted enough to find a favourite yet. I like being the pivot and yelling and I like to jam (when I don't suck at it) and I like to be a blocker and get in the way! I'm trying to encourage all our girls to be triple threats as I've seen from the Tiger Bay Brawler's success that that really seems to give you an edge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technique wise I always want to try and keep my feet moving as much as possible! That and skate low so people might not see me! Other than that I really don't know yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By telling anyone that will listen! That and using all the social media at my fingertips to tell everyone about New Town Roller Girls! I've had flyers in my work before as well using them to hand out whilst fundraising and all sorts. Sometimes I even tell people in my work about it as I'm serving them if I think they might be interested!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/ done this month?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have finally somewhat mastered derby stops and transitions! I could do them at faster speeds but they will come with time! They ain't perfect but I can sure has heck do them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the most difficult and the best things?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most difficult right now I'd say would be transitioning the /other/ way. In my case to my left. I am finding it very hard to do! I am attempting to master t-stops the opposite way in hope it helps me with transitioning the other way! I'd have to say some of the best things about derby and especially New Town for me is watching my hard work pay off and the other girls looking and skating amazingly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's new for the New Town this month?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing much is happening in July for New Town! We have some mins assessments coming up later on in the month so hopefully after that we'll have some exciting news for people! Right now we are working hard and plodding along nicely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside that 2 of our girls (myself included) will be taking part in the Granite City Roller Girls cherry popper bout on the 13th in Dundee! We are fairly excited! I am actually less nervous for that than I am for the LRG bootcamp at the end of July though! I think on the day of the bout it'll be a different story!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>interviews</category><category>monthly diary</category><category>new town colliders</category><category>new town roller girls</category><guid>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/07/12/monthly-diary-of-a-league-new-new-town-roller-girls-in-july-hazzard/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2013 09:12:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Monthly Diary Special: Deadly Divas in June: Juggs Knock'her</title><link>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/06/21/monthly-diary-special-deadly-divas-in-june-juggs-knockher/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know how much everyone looks forward to the Monthly Diaries (or at least, I like to believe you do!), and felt bad about short changing our loyal viewers with only one entry last month. So, this month we have an extra bonus diary to make up for it, from Glasgow/Renfrewshire's newest league: &lt;a href="http://deadlydivasrollerderby.webs.com/"&gt;Deadly Divas Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt;, here's Juggs Knock'er.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/06/dsc01592.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-2714" alt="Juggs lining up to jam at the Diva's practice session." src="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/06/dsc01592.jpg?w=614" width="614" height="409"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Juggs lining up to jam at the Diva's practice session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What first attracted you to Roller Derby?&lt;/strong&gt;
A few mates mentioned it about a year ago and thought nothing of it at the time.Then I saw that Deadly Divas Roller Derby were starting up and decided to give it a bash! Always been a bit of a tomboy and loved skating as a kid so thought why not! I haven't looked back since and made some amazing friends as well as discovering a lot about myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are your derby heroes?&lt;/strong&gt;
That's a hard one! Bonnie D Stroir from the San Diego Derby dolls has to be mentioned as I watched her loads on youtube and still do! Also have to mention my derby wife AJ la Kaos here as she has been there encouraging me and the others from day one and she shows a great fighting spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when you're starting out. How did you choose your name, and how does it reflect your personality on track?&lt;/strong&gt;
Initially I chose the name Ms Clara-Hell, as Clarabelle has been a nickname that has stuck with me for years with friends and family alike. However the more and more practices and other skating events I attended it became apparent that Juggs was more appropriate! Take from that what you will! As it is a bit of a more risque name, I feel that sums me up pretty well on track as I take a lot of risks... an attitude I have had for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your biggest initial difficulty?&lt;/strong&gt;
I'd have to say the whole thing. I ice skated as a child and teenager and thought I would pick it up easily. The first training session was tough, I realised how unfit I was and how appaulling my skating skills were, I could not be upright for more than a couple of minutes and spent most of it on my arse! But I did go away that day having learned how to get up after a fall, falling safely and discovering that I am no quitter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word?&lt;/strong&gt;
Basically every chance I have had I'm speaking about derby practice and skating! People are always asking me what derby entails and I love telling them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/ done this month?&lt;/strong&gt;
Training towards these new minimum skills. A lot of hard work to do, and a lot of frustration that comes with it! Also been doing some coaching with the fresh meat which has helped me learn a lot, and made me reflect on my own basic skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were the most difficult and the best things?&lt;/strong&gt;
The most difficult has been dealing with my own skating skills and crossovers especially! The best things have to be skating with other people and getting psyched up about derby! I;ve been fortunate enough to be welcomed to the New Town Roller Girls practices where I've learned many skills and made some amazing friends. To be honest, although my derby career is still in the early stages, I've loved every moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's new with the Deadly Divas this month?&lt;/strong&gt;
We have been working on the new mins, recruiting, and working on strategy.... watch this space!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>ddrd</category><category>ddrg</category><category>deadly divas roller derby</category><category>interviews</category><category>monthly diary</category><guid>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/06/21/monthly-diary-special-deadly-divas-in-june-juggs-knockher/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2013 21:04:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Monthly Diary of a League: Fierce Valley in June: Must-Dash</title><link>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/06/19/monthly-diary-of-a-league-fierce-valley-in-june-must-dash/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a slightly expanded array of Monthly Diaries this month, &lt;a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/06/19/monthly-diary-of-a-league-fierce-valley-in-june-must-dash/www.fvrg.co.uk"&gt;Fierce Valley Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt; bring you: Must-Dash!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/06/603122_205960202875611_438612260_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-2710" alt="Must-Dash with Mustache!" src="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/06/603122_205960202875611_438612260_n.jpg?w=614" width="614" height="921"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Must-Dash with Mustache!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What first attracted you to Roller Derby?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
What first attracted me to derby was my sister the infamous Danger Mouth, I went along with her at the beginningish when ARRG was in it's early stages but alas I just was not completely ready for the world of derby then... so I put it on the back burner... silly Dash.
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are your derby heroes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Danger Mouth is my main hero, her hits are intense: I remember stupidly requesting one from her at a training practice and I went quite some distance and pretty sure I was smacked off the wall a little... ahhh good times.
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when you're starting out. How did you choose your name, and how does it reflect your personality on track?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
My name came about for my love of moustaches: all those gentlemen with their fine facial accessories, their lip quivering no more in the cold air of an evening stroll.
&lt;p&gt;So how does my name transpire on track, I am a true gent and always try and open the opposing  walls for my ladies... and I have become a bit better at dashing as a Jammer.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your biggest initial difficulty?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
I would have to say cross overs, they were a real beach... and my 25 in 5; I forget just how unfit I was before I committed myself more fully to derby, joining FVRG has helped me grow as a skater and a person so much. I just couldn't wish for a more supportive driven derby family, not to mention funtasticical.
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
I constantly tell people at my cafe about the wonderful world of derby: "Here's your bacon roll ma'am, you have strong looking legs... ever considered donning some wheels??"
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/ done this month?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
I jammed for the first time in a bout situation which was pretty great, and won the award for best blocker. Needless to say I was on a bit of a high after our intraleague Transformers themed bout.
&lt;p&gt;I have learnt that I can stand on one skated leg whilst making goat noises quite successfully as can my fellow pals deal with me doing this and also keep balance... I was embracing the spirit of the mountain goat to make my balance better.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were the most difficult and the best things?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The most difficult thing was probably hearing that Maz-manian devil was leaving us :(. Then the best was hearing that she's totally had a change of heart and is coming back! SCORE!! Me and Brawny made a video for her and everything, she even got a leaving party out of us all, she turned our world upside down face... I suppose I can forgive her for lying to us... in time.
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's new for the Fierce Valley this month?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
We will be beasting the training sessions and scrimming to ready prepare us for July try outs for the FVRG and Jakey Co-ed bout on the 10th of August. We will also be crafting a hefty amount to bring along to the Pop up shop at Callander house which is happening on the 13th of July so it's worth nipping along to see our wares :)&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fierce valley roller girls</category><category>fvrg</category><category>interviews</category><category>monthly diary</category><guid>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/06/19/monthly-diary-of-a-league-fierce-valley-in-june-must-dash/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2013 19:37:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Monthly Diary of a League: Fierce Valley in May: Brawny Tyler</title><link>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/05/17/monthly-diary-of-a-league-fierce-valley-in-may-brawny-tyler/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Just in time for Eurovision on Saturday, this month's diary from &lt;a href="http://www.fvrg.co.uk/"&gt;Fierce Valley Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt; is by UK-entry-namesake, Brawny Tyler!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What first attracted you to Roller Derby?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
My sister Meadhbh started with Belfast Roller Derby in August 2011 and wouldn't stop talking about it. I went to see her bout in an intra league game in November, despite being totally baffled by the rules, I loved it. She told me about Fierce Valley and with a bit of encouragement I got in contact and I haven't looked back.
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are your derby heroes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Have to say my sister, eh :) Sylvia Wrath. She really is though, I'm so proud of how far she's come with roller derby, now being Captain of the Banshees. I got the chance to scrim with her but I'm not sure I'd want to play against her!
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when you're starting out. How did you choose your name, and how does it reflect your personality on track?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
It was a nightmare choosing a name, I struggled to find something I thought was good enough. Some things I thought were hilarious, flopped when I told other people... Brawny Tyler just popped into my head one day; I do love a good power ballad, particularly Total Eclipse of the Heart. I'm a little ashamed of her most recent song for Eurovision though, she's letting the side down.
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your biggest initial difficulty?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Fear, particularly of falling and hurting myself. As my confidence grew though, the fear subsided, or at least the drive to get better started to override the fear. That and a pair of padded shorts.
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Because derby has taken over my life I always feel the need to tell people about it. Recently the trainer taking my gym induction, I talked her in to contacting FVRG about Fresh Meat.
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/ done this month?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Embracing and being more positive about the new WFTDA mins. At first it was a bit daunting but at least it's forced me to focus on certain skills like transitions. After picking up some good tips at the GRD bootcamp I'm sure I'll get it...eventually!
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were the most difficult and the best things?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
I'm finding it hard getting used to being split up as we prepare for the intra-league, it feels strange to be pitting myself against people who have been team mates. It is all in good spirit though and I'm really looking forward to it. Ask me next week though and I'll probably say climbing Ben Nevis!
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's new for the Fierce Valley this month?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt; Our Intraleague bout, &lt;a href="http://www.fvrg.co.uk/news-story.php?id=70"&gt;Revenge Of The Fallen&lt;/a&gt;, is very soon. Deceptiquads Vs Autoblocks; watch out for shiney leggings. It's really exciting because we have enough skaters for two teams, it's great to see FVRG growing!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fierce valley roller girls</category><category>fvrg</category><category>interviews</category><category>monthly diary</category><guid>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/05/17/monthly-diary-of-a-league-fierce-valley-in-may-brawny-tyler/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2013 09:22:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Monthly Diary of a League: Fierce Valley in April: Camelon Diaz</title><link>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/04/08/monthly-diary-of-a-league-fierce-valley-in-april-camelon-diaz/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's that time of month again when we hear from &lt;a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/04/08/monthly-diary-of-a-league-fierce-valley-in-april-camelon-diaz/fvrg.co.uk"&gt;Fierce Valley&lt;/a&gt;'s latest skater to make an entry in the diary. This month, it's Camelon Diaz, PR Rep, coach and experienced blocker, up to the stand...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/04/484484_888111552394_1202023920_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-2485" alt="Camelon Diaz, centre, walling off Wirral Whipiteres at the front." src="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/04/484484_888111552394_1202023920_n.jpg?w=614" width="614" height="409"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Camelon Diaz, centre, walling off Wirral Whipiteres at the front. (Photo: Laura MacDonald)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What first attracted you to Roller Derby?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
A friend, Chaos Faerie, had been talking about roller derby and FVRG for months before persuading another friend, Monkey Wench, to try it out.  Once she also became addicted, I couldn't resist any longer and went along to a Fresh Meat session in August 2011.  I hadn't skated since I was a kid, but once I put those skates on and started skating, I was hooked too.
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are your derby heroes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
There are loads of amazing skaters out there that I love to watch, but the people I admire the most are those who come along to try it out, having not skated for years, or even never at all.  I'm a Fresh Meat coach and it's amazing to see how determined they are, how quickly they all pick up skills and how far they progress in a matter of weeks.  It's a proud moment when they move up from Fresh Meat!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when you're starting out. How did you choose your name, and how does it reflect your personality on track?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a long time thinking about derby names, coming up with lots of film-related names and changing my mind every week about which I would use, before my friend Angus suggested Camelon Diaz.  It probably makes no sense unless you're familiar with the Falkirk area, but Camelon is where I'm from, and the name just made me laugh.  I'm not entirely sure what it says about my personality on track, but I guess Camelon does have a reputation as being a bit tough...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your biggest initial difficulty?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
I used to skate all the time when I was younger, so the skating itself wasn't too much of a problem, but learning the skills needed for roller derby was.  I found practicising all those stops and falls over and over again so tiring at first.  I was terrified when we first moved onto to learning to hit, and, even worse, being hit.  The fear of getting hurt was always there, but that doesn't really bother me at all now.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of skaters find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just don't stop talking about derby!  I'm sure that my family, friends and work colleagues must be sick of hearing me talk about it.  I'm part of the FVRG PR committee, so it's almost my job to talk about it constantly and help to spread the word.  We've built some really good links within the local community and it's always fun to get involved with local events.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/ done this month?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The Parma Violents played in our second bout of the year at the end of March, travelling down to Newcastle to take on the Whippin' Hinnies.  It was a big challenge for us, one we've all learned a lot from, and it was a great experience overall.  We did a lot of work on tactics in the lead up to the bout - it sometimes takes me a while to get my head around these things, but I'm getting there!
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were the most difficult and the best things?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
I found it quite difficult coming out of one bout, against Preston in February, straight back into try-outs and preparation for another bout.  We'd never had as quick a turnaround like that before and it made for an intense period of training, not helped by the fact that I was ill for pretty much all of March!  It was all worthwhile though as the bout itself was an amazing experience, and it was great to see so many supporters from the league travel down to cheer us on.  We've developed a good team spirit and it's great fun being a Parma Violent!
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's new for the Fierce Valley this month?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
We have our second intraleague bout coming up next month [May 25th], so April is about try-outs and team selections, then getting ready to face each other on track.  A week before the bout, a group of us are taking on Ben Nevis, just for fun (!), which, personally, will be a huge challenge!&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fierce valley roller girls</category><category>fvrg</category><category>interviews</category><category>monthly diary</category><guid>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/04/08/monthly-diary-of-a-league-fierce-valley-in-april-camelon-diaz/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2013 12:43:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Monthly Diary of a League: Fierce Valley in March: Monkey Wench</title><link>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/03/15/monthly-diary-of-a-league-fierce-valley-in-march-monkey-wench/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month's monthly diary for &lt;a href="http://www.fvrg.co.uk/"&gt;Fierce Valley Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt; is from a long-standing member, who's contributed to the league in many ways since joining up. This month, we're throwing a Monkey Wench into the works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/03/396940_10151880516895392_722952694_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-2355" alt="Monkey Wrench hi-fives post T-Birds bout" src="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/03/396940_10151880516895392_722952694_n.jpg?w=614" width="614" height="409"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Monkey Wench hi-fives post Summer Shovin'  (photograph: zenspirations photography)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What first attracted you to Roller Derby?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My good friend Claire Brunton (Chaos Faerie) has been involved in FVRG since the early days and suggested that I should try it. After a few months of her persuading me I signed up for Fresh Meat in June 2011 and have never looked back! I always loved skating when I was a kid so thought this might be the sport for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are your derby heroes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some amazing skaters out there who are such an inspiration. We’ve got some fantastic skaters in Scotland who are so generous with their time and are always so helpful when they guest coach or when you see them at bootcamps/events. I love watching Alma Geddon skate, she’s a derby machine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when you're starting out. How did you choose your name, and how does it reflect your personality on track?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My husband (Duff McKegger of The Jakey Bites and Capital City Roller Derby) has always called me Monkey for some reason, probably because I’m cheeky! I’m a big Foo Fighters fan and there was a night at FVRG where I needed my name written down (might have been the start of mins siting) and Chaos shouted out Monkey Wench! It’s totally stuck although most people just call me Monkey now. I guess it suits me on track, I like to have fun with derby, I might not be the strongest player but I always do my best for the team and have a laugh while doing it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your biggest initial difficulty?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially it was the time, derby took over to be honest. But it’s worth every minute and I love spending time with my new FVRG family and our extended family in the derby community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just chatted about derby non stop to anyone who would, and those who wouldn’t, listen! It pays off though as I’ve managed to recruit Camelon Diaz, &lt;a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/02/24/monthly-diary-of-a-league-fierce-valley-in-february-wiggy-stardust/"&gt;Wiggy Stardust&lt;/a&gt; and Duff McKegger to the sport! I also try to help out at any promotional events FVRG do which is great fun and has it’s perks – last summer we met Mark Beaumont at an event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/ done this month?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month we’re working on our tactics and skills, so it’s good to go back to basics and just work on everything in your toolbag! On a personal note I’m continuing with my volunteer work for Marie Curie and promoting the Great Daffodil Appeal 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were the most difficult and the best things?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently had a non derby related injury and was off skates for the best part of 2 months which was really hard.It meant I wasn’t able to bout against the Wirral Whipiteres, in our first public home bout, which was disappointing as I’ve been lucky enough to be skating as a Parma Violent since our first closed bout, Candy Jam, in October 2011. I was also really worried that my injury might prevent me from being able to get back to being ready to bout/wanting to bout but I’ve now returned to fitness and have been selected for the upcoming bout against the Whipping Hinnies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best things about derby are the opportunities it brings about and the fab people I’ve met! I had the opportunity to floor manage the FVRG/Preston bout which was a great experience and I’ve been able to watch my girls bring in 2 home wins in a row! I was also Vice Captain of the T Stop Birds during the Summer Shovin Intraleague bout which was great fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's new for FVRG this month?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re off to Newcastle to play the Whipping Hinnies on 30th March so we’ve got a FVRG road trip to look forward to! We’ve also got a super exciting social event coming up for our league which will allow us all to get to know each other a bit better by speed dating!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/02/602323_10152271694600392_445056076_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-2239" alt="Wiggy Stardust at Fierce Valley's first public home bout (versus Wirral Whipiteres)." src="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/02/602323_10152271694600392_445056076_n.jpg?w=614" width="614" height="409"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Wiggy Stardust at Fierce Valley's first public home bout (versus Wirral Whipiteres).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What first attracted you to Roller Derby?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have Slayherella (GCRG) and Monkey Wench (FVRG) and their facebook status updates to thank for this one, their devotion to the sport was very clear and it had me intrigued. I was really interested in finding a team sport, and liked the idea of getting back into some quads, so following a conversation with my nephew I signed up for fresh meat with FVRG. I was hooked from then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who are your derby heroes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my early days of fresh meat it was all the trainers and helpers who were patient with me giving me hints, tips and wee confidence boosts, they are my hero’s, without them I would not be skating now. They made such a difference. Frocky Horror has a particular grace on skates and I envied her crossovers so much, the fact she spent so much time helping me to achieve a crossover was helpful. My heroes remain the same, the skaters around me who each week show determination and patience, both in teaching me and learning the drills.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when
you're starting out. How did you choose your name, and how does it &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;reflect your personality on track?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My name ‘Wiggy Stardust’, has had a wee journey. The nickname ‘Wiggy’ has been with me since my high school days when some comical teenage boys decided that I must be wearing a wig. No matter how hard they pulled the hair remained, as did the nickname. I struggled to find a derby name and an alterego so decided to make the most of what I already I. The ‘Stardust’ part was popularly voted for by my friends through facebook and I liked it as my head is so often staring up at the stars. The final vote was made at my first scrim when my team mates agreed on ‘Wiggy Stardust’ over the runner up name ‘Wiggy Pop’&lt;/div&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was your biggest initial difficulty?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See above – Cross overs. I really struggled with them. I read blog after blog and asked advice from so many different people. I even took to walking up and downstairs side aways so that I could cross my legs over into a lunge. Eventually it was just repetition, walking with my skates on and lunging round in circles in my kitchen, in my living room, in my garden. I was determined and practice got me there. I did let out a wee cheer when I achieved my first cross over on track.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;new sport. How have you been spreading the word?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Facebook led me to roller derby and helps me to spread its word. I also talk a lot about derby with my non-derby friends and family, I now have self imposed limits as to how long I talk about derby when I catch up with them. Although I do sneak it back into conversation by talking about fitness.&lt;/div&gt;
I think I am achieving something in getting the word out there, even my 99 year old Gran has donned my skate helmet in an attempt to learn more. Although I have asked for her not to be shown videos of roller derby as she might have something to say.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/ done this month?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering to stay focused on what the goal is, whether that be on a personal level or for the team. I have also realised that there is only the one of me and sometimes you just have to say ‘No’. I want to add that I have just played my third bout representing FVRG in the bout against Preston Roller Girls, the feeling coming off at the last Jam and looking up to the score board, I just wanted to cry with happiness. That was an amazing feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What were the most difficult and the best things&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult has been balancing derby life with non derby life. It is not easy and I am not sure I will ever get it right. Thankfully I have a very supportive and understanding family and an equally as awesome derby family, and I guess that is the best thing too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's new for the Fierce Valley this month?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February we had a home bout against Preston Roller Girls. They were awesome to play against. At the end of March we are bouting away to Newcastle Roller Girls Whipping Whinnies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fierce valley roller girls</category><category>fvrg</category><category>interviews</category><category>monthly diary</category><guid>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/02/24/monthly-diary-of-a-league-fierce-valley-in-february-wiggy-stardust/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2013 13:51:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Nasty Nessies 1 Year Later: Bee-Yatch</title><link>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/02/21/nasty-nessies-1-year-later-bee-yatch/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/02/21/nasty-nessies-1-year-later-bee-yatch/nastynessiesrollergirls.wordpress.com"&gt;Nasty Nessies&lt;/a&gt; founder Irn Bruzer launched our series of retrospective interviews with previous Nessie monthly diarists in Jan, this month we have &lt;a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/03/21/monthly-diary-of-a-league-nasty-nessies-in-march-bee-yatch/"&gt;Bee-Yatch&lt;/a&gt; to talk about how her feelings for derby have changed over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/02/comic-con.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-2213" alt="Bee-Yatch (centre) promoting the Nessies at Inverness Comic Con." src="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/02/comic-con.jpg" width="453" height="548"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Bee-Yatch (centre) promoting the Nessies at Inverness Comic Con.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like many skaters, you first encountered Roller Derby through watching "Whip It". Now you're mins-passed and scrimming, how do you feel about the reality of derby, compared with the image you first experienced?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality of derby is much better than any film! Getting to know a great bunch of girls and to do a sport that I never imagined I would be capable of is great. It’s hard work and requires a lot of commitment but I love every second of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now you've been skating and absorbing Derby for longer, have you picked up any Derby heroes or inspirations along the way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspiration for me comes from my own team mates, they share the good, the bad and the ugly and are always there to help you up and push you past the mental block that can prevent you from moving forward. I genuinely couldn’t ask for a better bunch of mishmashed people! As for heroes, well anyone who plays Roller Derby is an instant hero to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last time we talked, you mentioned that the most difficult and important challenges for you had been training related - building endurance and building skills and confidence. Looking back a year, would you give yourself different advice now than you thought then?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice to myself would be that everyone learns at a different pace, some people pick things up simply by watching then trying it themselves and others have to break it down more, either way keep on trying and never give up. You just have to learn to get up, dust yourself down and keep on going, you will get there in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And, following on from that, how do you see yourself as a skater now; what are your current challenges and inspirations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current challenge is to learn to put together all we have learned in training and apply it to the game. It’s good to build on endurance and skills but you need to know what to do with it all. There’s so much to think about, strategy, where you should be on the track, where’s your jammer, where’s their jammer, who is trying to push you off the track, who is about to land a hit on you….phew it’s a lot to think about/put into action all at once! ;-) How do I see myself as a skater now…hmm I think I will always be a newbie at heart!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Nessies have, of course, recruited more fresh meat since we talked. Being one of the Experienced Skaters in the league, how do you feel about the new blood coming in? (Are they scarily better than you were, do you empathise with their initial problems?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We currently have a great bunch of newbies, they seem to be so fearless! I see some girls after a few weeks and am so impressed with their abilities. I am not a natural born skater so I think I can relate to the more nervous newbie and keep them going with encouragement and be an example of how perseverance can keep you upright, in derby stance of course ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And, finally, what's new for the coming year with the Nessies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
A few of the Nessies went to Dundee last Friday and did some scrimming with the lovely Dundee Roller Girls. We were made to feel really welcome by all the girls and had an excellent time, we literally buzzed all the way home so thank you Dundee! :-)
&lt;p&gt;As for what we have up our sleeve for this coming year, 2013 is going to put NNRG on the map so keep your eyes peeled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month's retrospective will be by Natorious Red!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>interviews</category><category>monthly diary</category><category>nasty nessies roller girls</category><category>nnrg</category><category>one year later</category><guid>https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/02/21/nasty-nessies-1-year-later-bee-yatch/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2013 14:22:15 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
