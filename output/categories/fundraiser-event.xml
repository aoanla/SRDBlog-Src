Not only has it featured the 3rd Roller Derby World Cup itself, in Manchester; and the 3rd Men's Roller Derby World Cup, in Barcelona... but it will also see the first truly international &lt;a href="https://www.juniorrollerderby.org/2018champsandwc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Junior Roller Derby World Cup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as JRDA extends its Championships to include an National Teams tournament, including European representation for the first time..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great Britain will be one of 6 National or Quasi-national teams competing in the event, taking on Europe (also debuting), and the returning Teams of Canada, Australia, USA East and USA West for the JRDA World Cup Trophy, between &lt;strong&gt;23rd&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;24th July&lt;/strong&gt; (the two days following JRDA Champs), in Philadelphia, PA, USA!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll recognise some of the skaters involved in Team GB from the Roller Derby World Cup's Junior Roller Derby exhibition bout (and some of the others in that exhibition are in Team Europe, competing against them!); in fact, Team GB and Team Europe's mastermind, Phil Rutter, was responsible for organising that as well! (He's also the JRDA "European Regional Coordinator".)
Team GB Juniors has a host of other talent behind it, however: Head Coach, Toots, is a long established member of Lincolnshire Rolling Thunder + England Men's Roller Derby; also repeat members of England Men's are two support Coaches, Reaper (also of Southern Discomfort), and Tom-A-Hawk (also of Lincolnshire Rolling Thunder); the third support coach being England Roller Derby and London Roller Girls' equally skilled and experienced Beth Lord.
Beyond the coaches, there's a huge organising committee you can see &lt;a href="https://teamgbjuniorrollerderby.org/organisers/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough about the adults, though, you'll want to see the actual skaters! If you've missed the announcements, then here they are:
&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-26763 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/05/collage-finished.jpeg" alt="collage-finished" width="712" height="712"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a National team is expensive - and it's especially expensive when you have to fly intercontinentally, and even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; so when you're a Junior team (and thus need adults around for legal reasons too) - costs for Team GB Juniors will be at least £20000 overall...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, &lt;a href="https://teamgbjuniorrollerderby.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team GB Junior Roller Derby&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have been raising funds for some time - supported by some excellent teams across the UK in providing events! This way, you can both support the UK's Junior Roller Derby community, and also experience awesome Derby too...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-26762 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/05/gbjuniors.jpg" alt="GBJuniors" width="415" height="415"&gt; Team GB Juniors logo by &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/thatbeastjen/"&gt;Jen Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up: Peterborough's Borderland Brawlers Roller Derby host a double header (2 June 2018), combining some all-gender roller derby with the best of UK junior derby.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 June 2018, Peterborough: [&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/431804163914209/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Borderland Brawlers (Open To All, Peterborough) versus Mustard City Rollers (Open To All, Norwich) [FTS]&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Team GB Junior Roller Derby versus The World (UK Junior skaters): Level 3 Junior Derby Exhibition!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
If you'd like to learn something as well, Team GB Juniors also have you covered, as Rainy City Roller Derby are generously providing the Thunderdome to them to host a combined adult/junior bootcamp!
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;16 June 2018, Oldham: Brutecamp, with Rosie Peacock and Optimus Grime. [&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2209024095992483/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Team Scotland /  Glasgow Men's Roller Derby's Rosie Peacock, and Power of Scotland / Glasgow Men's Roller Derby's Optimus Grime host an all day bootcamp event:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Morning: Adult intermediate skill bootcamp + scrim&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Afternoon: Juniors Level 3 bootcamp + scrim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Learn from two national squad level skaters and coaches with extensive international experience!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
But that's not all! Eastbourne Roller Derby's annual Outdoor Roller Derby festival, Eastbourne Extreme, will also be featuring an exhibition bout from Team GB Juniors, and opportunities to help support the team!
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;15 July 2018, Eastbourne: [&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/700320030175090/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Eastbourne Extreme Outdoor Roller Derby Tournament
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Team GB Juniors Exhibition Event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
That will be your last chance to see Team GB Junior Roller Derby before all the skaters jet off to represent their combined nations at the Junior Roller Derby World Cup!

The &lt;strong&gt;3rd&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;September&lt;/strong&gt; might have a first even for Roller Derby, though, as Glasgow Caledonian University's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/ARC:+Health+and+Fitness/@55.8662153,-4.2519289,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4888441f10416197:0x3a9426f40d4b58b7!8m2!3d55.8662153!4d-4.2497349"&gt;ARC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; hosts a double-header extravaganza with the aim of raising money to save endangered sharks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organiser, Lisa Alexander, used to skate for Perth's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.faircityrollers.com/"&gt;Fair City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Edinburgh's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://arrg.co.uk"&gt;Auld Reekie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, before taking a break from derby in order to dedicate herself to her degree in Environmental Science with the University of the Highlands and Islands. As part of this, she's raising funds to support and participate in a conservation study in Fiji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8656" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/08/12573840_1555556068098928_7116823209862002714_n.jpg" alt="Shark Conservation" width="650" height="366"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharks are surprisingly endangered, mostly due to overfishing (for sharksfin soup and other foods), and the fact that, as apex predators, pollution affects them far more severely than other animals (as they eat all the pollution in their prey, too). Unfortunately, apex predators are also extremely important to the ecosystems they're part of - just as wolves kept deer populations under control in Scotland until we wiped them out, sharks manage the population of the rest of the ocean's inhabitants, and a threat to them is a threat to the entire balance of the sea's ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While she also has a more formal fundraising page &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myprojectsabroad.org/fundraising/4pP1eK"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (which has more information on the plan and situation), Lisa always planned to include Roller Derby in her approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I guess it was always a fundraising event that I had in mind," she told us. "I've been involved in Roller Derby for 5 years and, although I've stopped skating to concentrate on the project, I felt like I still had the experience and support network to make it a successful fundraiser.
I know how amazing and supportive the Roller Derby community is, and I knew that they would get behind the project; because, who doesn't love sharks, or roller derby?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With skaters participating from all across Scotland's leagues, the event will feature both a female and a co-ed mixed bout, as well as a host of stalls, a raffle (with a selection of prizes including handmade glass vases, and climbing tickets!), tombola, and plenty of shark-related theming and puns, it will be worth turning up even without the good cause. A shark-shaped stamp has even been sourced for stamping entrants...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Facebook event page is here: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/829978330437565/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/829978330437565/&lt;/a&gt; with the tickets available from Brown Paper Tickets here: &lt;a href="http://m.bpt.me/event/2580086"&gt;http://m.bpt.me/event/2580086&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doors open at 12:20 for the first bout around 20 to 30 minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are £10 on the day (free for under 14s), or just £8 in advance online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>crowdfunding</category><category>fundraiser event</category><category>fundraising events</category><category>sharks</category><category>upcoming bouts</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/08/12/save-our-sharks-in-september/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2016 18:13:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Power of Scotland's Assistant Coach: Rosie Peacock</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/02/27/power-of-scotlands-assistant-coach-rosie-peacock/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Caley Kapowski &lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/02/15/power-of-scotland-fundraising-for-calgary/"&gt;reported for the blog&lt;/a&gt;, Scottish Men's National Team, Power of Scotland, are going all out to raise money for the trip to Calgary for the second ever Men's Roller Derby World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One member of the Power of Scotland Team who has recently started her own fundraising endeavour is new Assistant Coach, &lt;strong&gt;Rosie Peacock&lt;/strong&gt;. As she's offering roller derby coaching, we caught up with her to talk a bit about her coaching experience, and what she's offering for those who may be interested. Rosie is also currently on &lt;a href="http://arrg.co.uk/teams/allstars/"&gt;Auld Reekie Roller Girls All-Stars&lt;/a&gt; roster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before we start talking about Power of Scotland specifically, we should start by spending a bit of time just to introduce you yourself...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm not sure there's a lot of time I could spend on it. I've been playing roller derby for 5 years; started off with Nottingham Hellfire Harlots. Just before Team England tryouts first time around, I had a knee operation, so I was out for that, which was gutting. Then coaching for probably the last 4 years; been all around the UK coaching on different levels - from professional through to National teams. There's not a lot interesting about me.
I like the fact that, in roller derby, you do not have to look like what society determines is an "athletic body" to be really good at this sport. And I like the fact that the fact that I've got really short stature and a really big arse and yet seem to be able to perform at a really high level, seems to give a lot of people quite a lot of hope.
&lt;p&gt;Also, I've been part of Team Metal Legs, which is for people who've been injured playing roller derby and forced to be off-skates for 3 months or more. We've done a lot of work, and that's just trying to build people's physical and mental confidence back up, after pretty traumatic breaks.
And that's been a lot of fun to do as well.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; And a lot of people seem to like you, too: you won the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/talkderby/"&gt;Talk Derby To Me&lt;/a&gt; [Podcast] "Personality" award for 2015.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Oh, yeah. [embarrassed chuckle] That's, that's, right…
So, I used to come up to Edinburgh a lot to visit, because I went to Uni here and it's where I met my husband, but then moved down to Nottingham, and then discovered roller derby. But I used to come back up, and when I did, I'd go and skate with my brother [Deathworm Jim], who used to skate for Capital City [Roller Derby]. (I'm still trying to persuade him to come back!)
&lt;p&gt;But I remember coming up for a scrim, and it was my first scrim back after my knee operation, and there was this massive guy, that looked like a Viking, looking quite nervous. [laughs] It was his first ever scrim. And that was, now Power of Scotland skater, Optimus Grime. I could just see so much potential in him, and rightly so, he's an incredible skater, puts in incredible hard work as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, he seems to be quite fond of me, which is really nice because it's nice to have someone who's that cool who's on your side.
He and Marryk [Talk Derby To Me co-host King Crazy] have been [inaudible] for quite a long time, we've announced together a few times, yeah, and I think because those guys… I think Grime nominated me and then Marryk's obviously quite fond of me too. (I don't know why! Maybe it's because I baked cookies for him one time!).
But [winning the award] was really amazing, actually, I had a little cry about that. Don't tell anyone, but yeah.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, coming back to Power of Scotland, you fairly recently became Assistant Coach. How has that experience been?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, due to life pressures happening for a couple of the other Power of Scotland guys, I'm now Assistant Coach, which is [long pause] &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;So, I get to see these guys progress, from tryouts to gelling as a team, and really starting to hone in on some of the tactics and bring it together as a unit. Because they're all, as individuals, enormously talented guys, but I think the key for these National teams is to get the team working together as a unit. These guys will all be the best skaters in their home leagues, and used to fulfilling certain roles within their home leagues, but within the Power of Scotland unit, you know, they very much need to learn to trust one another as a unit. Which is a challenge when you're used to being the guy who's maybe the last one, the last line of defence, or the jammer who doesn't need to take offence. When you're going to be playing Team USA, then you're going to be needing some offence!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's hard to emphasise how important this is for a National team in particular - "top dogs playing together", some of whom aren't domiciled in Scotland, who need to adjust to the different context.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Definitely. It's definitely a challenge. I think it's a big transition mentally, as well, for a lot of the guys, because, I mean, the guys who are based within Scottish leagues all know each other quite well. Scottish Roller Derby is quite a small community, although it's growing all the time, it's still concentrated relatively around Falkirk/Glasgow /Edinburgh/Dundee; Aberdeen being probably the furthest away of the Big Leagues that I'm aware of.
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, there's guys obviously eligible for tryouts from down in London, all kinds of leagues, and actually, those guys have gelled in really really well. It's really good - but I think it is a bit of a mindset change, because going from being possibly the best one or two guys in the league and being in a probably one-off-one-on kind of rotation to perhaps being in a one-in-three or whatever, that's a bit of an adjustment too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing personalities, the "superstars"?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, I love roller derby because, you can be a superstar but you will never be as good as four or five guys who are working together. And I tend to find that, overall, the superstar, or the, I guess not "superstars"  [because] for me, those are the guys who tend to be incredibly incredibly talented and skilled, but are also capable of being part of that unit. I guess the guys who are flashy, and do this stuff as an individual...
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ah, the glory hounds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;uhuh, uhuh. They get to a certain level of competition, and then they peter out. Because they find it difficult to put their desire to outperform their teammates, if they can't put that to one side, and use their skills to support their team and be part of that unit. Sometimes that means that you don't "look" very good, because you're the guy who's just standing in a wall, and everybody's like "what are you doing", but actually you're doing a really important job here! Those guys tend not to make it to this level of competition, I think purely because you know it's that, you can be the Stef Mainey of Roller Derby, but if you're not working as part of a team, the other four guys are gonna render you redundant.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5923" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/02/wp-1456494336545.jpg" alt="wp-1456494336545.jpg" width="1200" height="736"&gt; Rosie captaining the Hellfire Harlots against Newcastle Roller Girls in the British Champs Tier 2 Playoffs Final. (Credit: Jason "&lt;a href="http://www.roller-derby-on-film.co.uk/"&gt;Roller Derby on Film&lt;/a&gt;" Ruffell)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And of course, "The Stef Mainey" of Roller Derby is a very strong team player herself!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Exactly, exactly!
I think sometimes [teams say] "if someone's not good at doing this, we'll put them as a jammer, because jammers don't work together". But Jammers don't work on their own - you can't have effective team offence if the jammers aren't working with the rest of the team to make it happen. So, the days of "oh, it's okay that they have a massive ego, we'll just stick them onto jam", those are long gone!
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, you will be travelling to Calgary, the rest of the Team will be travelling to Calgary…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes! I haven't actually been able to pay for a ticket yet - I think because I stepped in relatively late on; I was part of the selection committee, but then took a step back, and it's only recently that I've stepped up into the Assistant Coach role. So I haven't actually had a chance to save any money, or plan, or prepare, at all. [laughs] So I am in a bit of a frantic frenzy of fundraising - not for myself, but for the Power of Scotland travel pot.
&lt;p&gt;The way that PoS are running it, is that there's an expectation that everyone will be doing something to fundraise, and if you've managed to raise £50 or £500 is irrelevant, it's about the effort that we're putting in as a team, to try and help one another with the cost of just getting over there and back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a bit late to the party, so I've got a bit of time to make up for that now!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power of Scotland are, themselves, offering Power of Scotland guest coaching as a fundraising approach (&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ayrshire-Roller-Derby-Official-618921518215712/"&gt;Ayrshire Roller Derby &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/DoonhameDerbyDolls/"&gt;Doonhame Derby Dolls&lt;/a&gt; both recently benefitted from this, for example). I guess that your coaching initiative is in addition to this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, I dunno, I'm like that jumper that you kind of only put on when you need something to put on, but it's still kinda comfy. [chuckles]
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know you don't like bigging yourself up too much, but we should say that you are a rather experienced coach!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Oh, my goodness. Okay, so , I guess, I can't even remember all of the leagues I've coached - and that sounds like I'm being an absolute dick but I honestly, I can't. But I've coached quite a lot around the Midlands; I've done a couple of bootcamps for some of the Northern English teams.
&lt;p&gt;Generally the newer teams starting out tend to be looking for guest coaches a lot more. Erm, because you can get to a certain level, with watching footage and coming up with stuff yourself, but then eventually you do want someone that's perhaps got a bit more experience to come and inject a few new ideas and kindof...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, recently we had [WFTDA #2 Ranked Victorian Roller Derby League's] Lorrae Adams &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/953866961316282/"&gt;come over to ARRG&lt;/a&gt;. My mind was blown, it was like: "wow, I can use my shoulders!" I guess I've never used my shoulders in Roller Derby because my hips are so much wider; every time I try and come in with a shoulder, it's a bit pointless - my bum's already there! But she really opened my eyes to a whole different array of ways to use my body to make people fall over, which was great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think, sometimes, passing that information on to other leagues, but in a way that works for them, is really crucial. I don't come in and just coach what I like to do! I ask the league what they're looking for, ask them if they've got any footage to get an idea of where they're at, and what the next steps for progress would be, and to make sure it's stuff that's going to work for them, drills they can take away and make their own, and develop. Rather than coming in and being all like "this is how I play roller derby, so everyone should play roller derby this way".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[For example], a lot of leagues will be doing different kinds of defensive wall now. In Scotland, people are predominantly, I think, using the braced three-wall with a sort of spare-guy. But perhaps elsewhere, you'll see a lot more of the cube-walls, and rotational walls, happening. So it's really important as a coach to understand and be able to coach all these things, whether your home league uses them or not.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So far you've talked about experiences with Women's derby, but we should say thay you've skated Coed with guys on track a lot too...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, I love Coed. I absolutely ... I would love if Coed had the same sort of competitive structure that WFTDA has. I actually think it's (don't tell anyone), I think it's a lot more &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; because you can really take advantage of the different body shapes and physicality of it all. I'm more of a thinky kind of skater, so rather than being particularly strong or particularly fast, I'll think about how to use somebody else's style as a way to knock them off balance, or control them, or frustrate them. I love Coed, because it's just something underestimated as an approach.
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, so I've done load of these kind of fun [events], like Last Action Hero, SciFight, just generally, if there's an opportunity to play any kind of high level Coed, I'll want to be there. We're defending our championship titles for SciFight this year as well, so that's Game On!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I guess it's inevitable that Coed experience involves lots of exhibition teams; there's not a lot of permanent teams (although that's changing, especially in Scotland!). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, so its understanding that, yes, there are differences in body dynamics that need to be accounted for [between men and women], but not overly focussed on. There used to be this thing of "well, girls block with their hips and boys block with their shoulders", and, although generally speaking men tend to have broader shoulders and their centre of gravity tends to be higher up, whereas women tend to have wider-set hips, and their weight tends to be lower down towards their hips level, that's absolutely not the absolute rule.
&lt;p&gt;There's loads of guys - there's a couple, [for example] Alan [Watt] in Power of Scotland who is an incredible blocker with his hips. And it really annoys me actually when people say "Oh, he blocks like a girl!", because, no, he blocks like an &lt;em&gt;incredible skater&lt;/em&gt;, gender has nothing to do with it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there's teammates that I've skated with that their shoulders are much broader than their hips, and they've got incredible power in their shoulders.
So, I would love it if it got to the stage where gender just didn't matter in roller derby. If it was "so, this is the team from [say] Manchester", and it's the team of the best skaters in Manchester, and how they identify in terms of their gender, or what their organs are, has no relevance. That's what I'd really like to see.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender policies and feelings about this are changing, though. For example, the UKRDA gender policy was an early leader in this kind of thing (before WFTDA themselves updated a bit).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;I really like the way MRDA is heading, in terms of "actually, you don't have to specify a gender, you just can't be a female skating on a female league, and also an MRDA member league".
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;They just need to drop the 'M' from MRDA…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah. I know that Mean City in Glasgow have taken quite a lot of positive steps in terms of starting off as a Men's League, I guess in answer to the fact that there was only a female league set up at the time [Glasgow Roller Derby]. And now they've got to the stage where they're "actually, we don't care how you identify, we want you to come and skate with us, we want you to be the best you can be". And I really like that.
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and a lot of the newer leagues in Scotland are defaulting to Coed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, and I guess in terms of the higher ranked teams, there's going to be that decision in terms of well, in terms of Rankings, a lot of it is done in terms of the WFTDA, which does have a more stringent gender policy, whether you agree with it or not, so it's "Women's Flat Track Roller Derby", and that is currently the primary Ranking System for the top level teams.
&lt;p&gt;So, it's like "wouldn't it be nice if we could see WFTDA and MRDA merge to 'RDA', and [have] that ranking system take off, and make that conscious decision to stop caring about gender, in terms of athletic ability".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying gender's not important to people on an individual basis - of course it is - but in terms of having an impact on someone's ability to perform in a sport, I think it's absolutely irrelevant.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sure, I think there's probably still sports where there's a genuine gender gap (powerlifting, for example), although they do tend to be narrowing over time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, and I think [in roller derby], the wheels are the great equaliser. You can be as big and strong as you like, but someone half your weight and a slip of a thing can out-manoeuvre you, and you're done.
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And you get lighter guys too, it's not just "Big Men versus Small Women". Jim Whyte, on PoS, is a pretty lightly built guy, but he does great things on track.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, and he's a fantastic blocker. I know he does a lot of jamming, because he is so incredibly skilled on his feet, but you know, I've made the mistake in games of thinking, "ahh, weight ratios, I'll take him on his chest, it'll be fine!" And it's not fine! He's really good at assessing the angle that someone's coming in at, and counter-leaning really well.
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This seems like a good place to start wrapping up; is there anything you'd like to particularly emphasise to the readers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;So, yes, I'm just really keen to get out and.. I've taken a little bit of a break from coaching, because of the move from Nottingham up to Edinburgh, and that's taken a bit of a transition, and I've been kind of focussing on getting used to the way that things are done at ARRG, because on joining any new league there's a transition experience in terms of tactics and things. But, yeah, I just really miss coaching, I would really like to get out, try and spread the Derby Love to some other teams.
&lt;p&gt;There's quite a lot of weekends between now, and July 20th, which is when we fly out, some of them are already pretty fully booked, but there's lots of weekends free.
And I'm doing quite a lot of travelling anyway, so hopefully, I can book things in when I'm already in the local area.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You could even try to get in some coaching when you're over at the Big O with Auld Reekie!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, ARRG are in as one of the lowest (WFTDA) ranked teams in the tournament, so that's going to be an amazing challenge. I can't see Rose City saying, "Hey, come over any coach us!". [laughs] That would be amazing, but no.
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Sure, but there's tons of smaller leagues in the USA too. Just like US skaters have basically just heard of London Rollergirls; skaters in the UK only hear about the big leagues in the USA. You don't see the smaller, just as interesting, leagues from the distance...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, yeah, I hadn't thought of it that way!
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosie is happy to discuss coaching anywhere in the UK, subject to travel costs for longer trips.

&lt;p&gt;Scottish Men's National Roller Derby Team, Power of Scotland, are off to Calgary next year to compete in the second Men's Roller Derby World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(They're also off to the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/4NRDC/"&gt;4Nations&lt;/a&gt; tournament this weekend, to play against France, Wales and England, which we'll have some reporting about after the event.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In support of their expenses in travelling across the Atlantic to represent their country, Power of Scotland have planned a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/432571486927246/"&gt;packed fundraising event&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;strong&gt;13th&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;December &lt;/strong&gt;on the theme of "Beards, Brains and Brainpower".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "beards" component will be represented by the result of the &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/posbestbeard"&gt;Sponsored Beard Shave&lt;/a&gt; contest. Three Power of Scotland more hirsute skaters - Bairn City's rEd Baron, Wirral's 12 Gauge and Mean City's Optimus Grime - have been competing to collect sponsorship funds. At this fundraiser, the skater with the least funds raised will be professionally shorn of their carefully tended facial hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the "brains" component is provided by a Team Quiz Night, featuring multiple rounds and multiple prizes. Teams are limited to 5 people. The quizmaster, Alan Muir, has been working hard on fiendish practical puzzlers, so we anticipate a challenging event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the "beers" element is provided by the host venue, &lt;strong&gt;The Raven&lt;/strong&gt;, at &lt;strong&gt;81-85 Renfield Street, Glasgow&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night of fundraising will start at &lt;strong&gt;18:45.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fundraiser event</category><category>fundraising</category><category>fundraising events</category><category>men's roller derby</category><category>power of scotland</category><category>team scotland</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/11/24/shear-brilliance-fundraising-for-power-of-scotland/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2015 11:40:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>East Fortune Roller Marathon 2015</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/08/06/east-fortune-roller-marathon-2015/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/08/untitled.png"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4841" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/08/untitled.png" alt="EastFortune2015" width="512" height="322"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT - Sadly, due to low turnout and other reasons, the East Fortune Roller Marathon has been cancelled this year.-EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year in a row, the &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/East+Fortune+Race+Circuit,+North+Berwick,+East+Lothian+EH39+5JX/@56.0005266,-2.7071147,14.31z/data=!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x488707fc19ca8445:0xc060a6b57cd7540d!2sEast+Fortune+Race+Circuit,+North+Berwick,+East+Lothian+EH39+5JX!3b1!3m1!1s0x488707fc19ca8445:0xc060a6b57cd7540d"&gt;East Fortune Race Track&lt;/a&gt; will be hosting a charity Roller Marathon. In previous years, the event has been very popular with the Scottish roller derby community, and we anticipate that it will be just as popular this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, the event is open to any non-powered small-wheeled transport, so quad skaters will find themselves against not just inliners but also potentially skateboarders and scooters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a change to the charity from last year, the event will be raising funds for the &lt;a href="https://www.soidog.org/"&gt;Soi Dog Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which works to help homeless, neglected and abused dogs and cats in Thailand, including working to end the dog meat trade and contributing to response to animal welfare emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marathon sponsors, &lt;a href="http://www.kaossk8.com"&gt;Kaos Skate Shop&lt;/a&gt; have also donated prize vouchers for the three fastest competitors, to the total of £225 (£100 for 1st place).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign up is possible via the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/eastfortunerollermarathon2015"&gt;Facebook Page&lt;/a&gt;, or payment to &lt;strong&gt;eastfortunerollermarathon@yahoo.co.uk&lt;/strong&gt; . The entry fees vary from £5 for a single lap of the track, through to a bargain £15 for the whole marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Event will take place on &lt;strong&gt;3 October 2015&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fundraiser event</category><category>fundraising events</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/08/06/east-fortune-roller-marathon-2015/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2015 10:04:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GCRG Rock Night</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/09/23/gcrg-rock-night/</link><dc:creator>caleykapowski</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday 17th October Granite City Roller Girls are hosting the next long awaited Rock Night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A night of Rock music featuring some homegrown talent, a booze raffle and other awesome prizes up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/09/gcrg-rock-night.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/09/gcrg-rock-night.jpg" alt="GCRG rock night" width="614" height="868" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3859"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lineup includes;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking Sideways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A local band from Aberdeen heavily influenced by Biffy Clyro
&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/talkingsideways" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.facebook.com/talkingsideways&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miss Lucid
&lt;span class="text_exposed_show"&gt;Miss Lucid offer their own style of 'in your face' rock, driven with the punk/grunge undertones of bands such as The Clash and Nirvana, blending large sonic sound scapes and crafted melodies reminiscent of Placebo and Manic Street Preachers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="text_exposed_show"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/MissLucid" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/MissLucid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Guttergodz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="text_exposed_show"&gt;An eclectic mix of influences in the band such as Thin Lizzy, The Wildhearts, Elvis Presley, Backyard Babies, The Clash and so on. In 2010 they made it into the shortlist of bands rated 'particularly awesome' by Kerrang radio and at the start of 2013 they were crowned 'Best Rock Band' at the Fudge awards in Aberdeen and made it to the final of Cafe Drummond's battle of the bands to win £2000.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/guttergodz" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/guttergodz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doors open at 8pm with £8.00 entry. An absolute bargain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus booze raffle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...did I already mention booze raffle? I'm just pretty excited about somebody winning a hamper of booze and rocking out to some great music&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So come on down to Downstairs at 82 Holburn Street and start your weekend off on a high!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there's a huge amount of exciting roller derby happening this month (Internationally, and otherwise), sometimes you may need a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for you, Voodoo Roller Dollies are holding the Voodoo Unplugged event on May 29th, providing an evening of acoustic music from local bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are £5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information can be found on the event page on Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1380425432218066/?ref=5&amp;amp;source=1"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/1380425432218066/?ref=5&amp;amp;source=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds raised from this event will go towards future VRD bouts. The Dollies are also running a GoFundMe page to specifically raise money for their planned away bout against Belfast. You can donate to that here: &lt;a href="http://www.gofundme.com/8s3j64"&gt;http://www.gofundme.com/8s3j64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FVRG skater - Must-Dash - will test the limits of your general knowledge from 8pm until late, and the bar staff will be serving a selection of FVRG-themed cocktails during the quiz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are the prizes on offer? Well apart from winning the admiration of all the other quizzers, you could also win a pair of tickets to the upcoming &lt;a title="FVRG vs GCRG" href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/08/12/fvrg-vs-gcrg/" target="_blank"&gt;FVRG vs. Granite City Roller Girls bout&lt;/a&gt;, or a meal voucher for two people at The Voodoo Lounge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entry will be charged at £1.50 per person, with a maximum of four people per team to keep things fair. This event is only open to those aged 18 and over due to licensing laws at the venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds raised at the event will go towards the general running of Fierce Valley Roller Girls, and can hopefully help subsidise their upcoming &lt;a title="UKRDA Website" href="http://ukrda.org.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;UKRDA &lt;/a&gt;application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, and very soon indeed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/05/harshtugimage.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2612" alt="harshTugimage" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/05/harshtugimage.jpg" width="419" height="594"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://glasgowrollerderby.com/content/harsh-tug-fundraiser"&gt;Harsh Tug @ The Flying Duck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night of the 24th of May sees The Notorious B.A.G. provide a night of hip-hop, gangsta rap, and other musical genres which this correspondant is too old to properly appreciate, hosted at The Flying Duck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All proceeds go to the ECDX fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/05/facebook_65874.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2613" alt=".facebook_65874" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/05/facebook_65874.jpg" width="453" height="640"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're still up for more Glasgow Roller Derby related musical goodness, GRD-skater-based-duo SummerSlams are DJing an event, &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/335576776567980/"&gt;"Bitch, Please!"&lt;/a&gt;, at Nice N Sleazy on the night of the 31st of May, promising an eclectic mix of musical genres, and specially featuring Glasgow-based Grime artist Patricia Panther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, all proceeds go to the ECDX fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of the above events start at 11pm, and are £3 entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you're not one for late nights and music, the long promised GRD Fundraising Auction has launched, with "items" up for bidding including tickets to various events, custom art works, cupcakes and one day's time from a GRD skater. You can check out all of the possibilities on the special &lt;a href="http://glasgowrollerderby.com/auctions"&gt;GRD Auction&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
