&lt;p&gt;We caught up with &lt;a href="http://www.invernessrollerderby.com/"&gt;Inverness City Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.faircityrollers.com/"&gt;Fair City Rollers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ayrshire-Roller-Derby-Official/618921518215712"&gt;Ayrshire Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; to get their perspective on the past year. Doonhame Derby Dolls have also been having an exciting year, and their experience in trying to start up a second junior derby league in Scotland &lt;a title="The Future of Derby: Junior Roller Derby, Part Two" href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/12/10/the-future-of-derby-junior-roller-derby-part-two/"&gt;has been covered here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayrshire Roller Derby, having started as a Women's Derby League in late 2013, caused some surprise by announcing their intent to change to a Co-Ed league structure in mid 2014 (becoming Scotland's second Co-ed league, although not the second bouting Co-ed, with Mean City's change to Co-ed more recently). Ayrshire's Nicola Manley had this to say about their year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ayrshire Roller Derby has had a good year in 2014. We have restructured the management at ARD and have a very dedicated team. We have recently enjoyed success with some fundraising and as a result will be able to provide some kit so new recruits can come and try out skating. We have been working hard on our training schedule to find one that works for us and provides plenty of variety.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our change to a CoEd league was perhaps a little soon and not without its own problems....namely lack of male interest also, some women were uncomfortable with idea so we need to think carefully about this in the New Year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have a number of skaters ready to take their minimum requirement skills test shortly, so we plan to be putting a team together in the spring. We are extremely grateful to our friends in other local leagues for all of their support and have had guest skaters come and help us out from time to time, which has been greatly appreciated!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the northernmost league in Scotland, Inverness City Roller Derby (ex Nasty Nessies) have also gone Co-ed, as well as continuing to strengthen and develop the league as a whole. Speaking for the league, Bee-Yatch said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2014 was a busy year for ICRD and our greatest news of the year was securing a permanent venue, we are now in Hilton Community Centre on Monday and Wednesday evenings. Having secured this venue means we can now actively recruit again for ICRD and have just started advertising for our next intake which starts in February.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt; At the moment ICRD have a mixed bunch of skaters and are working on getting all of the team MINS passed, some skaters are already MINS passed and are on hand to help the newer skaters and encourage/motivate them to keep going and be awesome!  Last year we brought the age for training down to 16 as we had interest from younger skaters wanting to become involved  in the team. As we don’t currently have a junior league (we’re working on it though!) we decided to lower the age to 16, on a strict no contact basis until skaters become 18.  This has had a positive effect on the team and along with being co-ed we are keen to promote Roller Derby as an inclusive sport open to all regardless of age, gender or ability.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt; ICRD launched our new website this year as well to reflect our new name, logo and colours. The site is easy to navigate and over the coming months will have information from skater profiles to taster sessions for those interested in strapping on a pair of skates and joining up! The website can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.invernessrollerderby.com/" target="_blank"&gt;www.invernessrollerderby.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all of the non-bouting leagues in this round-up, Fair City Rollers will be leaving most quickly - they caused some excitement on being announced as one of the teams at Voodoo-hosted Highland Rampage tournament in February, marking their return to bouting status after some time rebuilding. Lauren Kettles, Fair City's PR rep had this to say about their preparations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the beginning of this year, we were mainly focused on getting our existing skaters through the last of their minimum skills, so it may have seemed like we were less visible for a while. However, after a couple of Fresh Meat intakes  and increasing our numbers again, we started to contact other leagues. I've been out and about getting some experience in various NSO positions in Dundee, Glasgow and Forth Valley. I then took on responsibility for interleague liaison and continue to keep the league up to date with information on scrims, bouts and other training opportunities. All other leagues we've had contact with have been really helpful, welcoming us back with invites to open scrims and opportunities to train with guest coaches. It's important for us to be strongly engaged with the wider derby community, particularly as we build our team towards bouting again. It's been really valuable to us all to be able to keep in contact with other leagues over the year, as any derby related learning is beneficial whether it's on or off skates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking towards our inaugural bout, we've been working hard, getting our intermediate skaters through their mins and training up September's newbie intake. We've also been scrimming with other local leagues at open opportunities and getting some valuable NSO experience too. Guest coaching has also been beneficial, with trainers from across Scotland putting us through our paces. Highland Rampage will be a great opportunity to get back into bouting and also begin to establish Fair City Rollers as part of the derby community again. Some of the other leagues taking part have already been helpful to us with scrim invites etc, and we look forward to joining them on track for real.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three leagues also have Plans for 2015, with all three focussing on recruitment and expansion into the new year. Fair City have already held their first Fresh Meat of the year, last Monday, while Inverness will be holding theirs in February. Ayrshire are simply open to new recruits on a permanent basis, and encourage everyone to contact them via their Facebook page. With Fair City gaining a 2014 Communities grant from the Big Lottery Fund, enabling them to double their training sessions per week, and Inverness City skating in a charity bout and also planning bootcamps for March, it will be an exciting year for all three leagues in 2015!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>2014 in review</category><category>articles</category><category>ayrshire roller derby</category><category>fair city rollers</category><category>interviews</category><category>inverness city roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/01/11/non-bouting-leagues-round-up-of-2014/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2015 12:03:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Glasgow Roller Derby:  Round-Up of 2014</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/12/29/glasgow-roller-derby-round-up-of-2014/</link><dc:creator>paingrrl666</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ecxMsoNormal"&gt;&lt;img id="featured-image" class=" aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/grd-logo.jpg?w=300" alt="Featured image" width="166" height="166"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ecxMsoNormal"&gt;Glasgow Roller Derby have had quite possibly our busiest year to date, and are already working hard on plans to make 2015 even better if possible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ecxMsoNormal"&gt;2014 saw GRD firmly establish our C team, the Cannie Gingers, and fully integrate them into Scottish Roller Derby with 4 amazing bouts spread throughout the year.   Our B Team, the Maiden Grrders, trained hard, culminating in a super win against London’s Batter C Power.  And our super A Team, the Irn Bruisers, took America by storm at Spring Roll, as well as capturing home wins against Middlesborough and Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ecxMsoNormal"&gt;&lt;img id="featured-image" class=" aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/maidens.jpg?w=300" alt="Featured image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ecxMsoNormal"&gt;Our 4 home teams battled throughout the year, culminating in the Bad Omens recapturing the winners trophy for Home Team Season 2014.  And many of our skaters represented at mixed games and tournaments across the UK.  This included 8 of our skaters playing for Vagine Regime UK throughout the year; 9 of our skaters representing their home countries at the World Cup in Dallas; as well as skaters representing at Sur5al, Skate of Ages and various other mixed charity games.  We love the enthusiasm and passion our skaters demonstrate for roller derby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ecxMsoNormal"&gt;&lt;img id="featured-image" class=" aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/world-cup.jpg?w=300" alt="Featured image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ecxMsoNormal"&gt;Our fundraising and events teams have been hard at work raising funds and events to allow GRD to do what we do best.  Successes included our awesome GoFundMe t-shirt campaign, with fantastic custom artwork by Gary Erskine.  There was also an American-themed fundraising bout, which saw our mini-bruisers defeat mini-America.  Lots of good fun!  And none of this could be possible without our wonderful PR committee, who spread the good word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ecxMsoNormal"&gt;Our skaters have also been hard at work off track, with some amazing league accomplishments.  Mistress Malicious, co-founder of Glasgow Roller Derby and UKRDA, organised the first UK-ROC in October 2014.  This was a huge success, bringing together skaters from across the UK to attend workshops and learn from the most experienced skaters in the world about roller derby infrastructure.  2 of our skaters were also involved in the UKRDA’s development of a fully inclusive Transgender Policy and Guidance, which has been voted in as operational for every member league in the UK.  And our WFTDA reps have been hard at work, with tireless Bruisers captain and WFTDA rep Rogue Runner assisting in strategic development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ecxMsoNormal"&gt;What next for GRD?  We plan to train even harder, and play even harder.  Each of our travel teams has their own goals in sight, and as a league we plan to get even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ecxMsoNormal"&gt;We will be kicking the year off with a fantastically diverse fundraising bout on Sat 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Jan at the Arc, showcasing a mixed Glasgow team playing against the highly skilled Vagine Regime UK.  The bout will be followed by a drag party, where everyone is encouraged to leave the confines of socially constructed gender behind and just have a jolly good time exploring gender expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ecxMsoNormal"&gt;Our Bruisers will be competing in Tier 1 of the British Championships, showcasing UK derby at its best.  Our Maiden Grrders will be hosting a B-level Scottish tournament, and our Cannie Gingers will be appearing in the Highland Rampage tournament.  Invites are flooding in for each of our teams to skate, and our games schedule is looking very exciting!  We shall also be announcing new team captains for each team, as well as looking to optimise on our events schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ecxMsoNormal"&gt;&lt;img id="featured-image" class=" aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/bruisers.jpg?w=300" alt="Featured image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ecxMsoNormal"&gt;If this sounds like something you want to get in on, then Glasgow Roller Derby are holding a new intake on Sunday, January 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 2015 – and we would love to see you there!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/735097_492237780841642_237571758_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-4501" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/735097_492237780841642_237571758_n.jpg?w=300" alt="Dundee Roller Girls logo." width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Dundee Roller Girls logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dundee Roller Girls' Silvery Tayzers started the year with their first game against old rivals Granite City Roller Girls Northern Fights in Aberdeen. The Tayzers had never beaten GCRG in their previous games but after an almighty comeback by GCRG in the second half the Tayzers finally came out winners with a 182 – 83 victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed was a hectic season with the Tayzers playing more games both home and away than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An away win against Newcastle’s Whippin Hinnies (131 -163), was closely followed by home defeat to Hulls Angels Roller Dames in the most dramatic of overtime jam finishes. Furness Firecrackers were the next team to make the trip to Dundee and were defeated 178 – 157 in a thrilling match-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May saw one of the most exciting developments in DRG history, with the launch of our Home Teams Season. Assisted by the Big Lottery Fund, DRG were awarded £2000 to develop the Home Teams brand. Sticking close to Dundee’s Jute, Jam and Journalism history, three teams were created; The Jutes of Hazzard, Jammin’ Dodgers and the Press Gangsters. After a summer season of Home Teams games, the Jutes and Press Gangsters fought it out for the trophy with the Press Gangsters triumphing in the final 163 - 108.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/10628596_10100312218540564_7362283630468818259_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-4500" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/10628596_10100312218540564_7362283630468818259_n.jpg?w=614" alt="Dundee's Rising Stars, post Bairn City bout (Photo: Laura MacDonald)" width="614" height="409"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Dundee's Rising Stars, post Bairn City bout (Photo: Laura MacDonald)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late summer also saw the first game for DRG’s B team with the Rising Stars defeating Durham Roller Derby by a single point in nail-biting game (172 – 171). The Silvery Tayzers were also in action on this double-header day being defeated by a hard-hitting Roller Derby Leicester team (107 – 228).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second double header pitted the Rising Stars against Team White and the Tayzers playing Halifax’s Bruising Banditas, with both teams securing victories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The autumn began with the Tayzers playing two away games to FVRG and their furthest away trip to Swansea. Both games ended in defeat for the Tayzers but they left with a great deal of experience gained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tayzers final game of the season was another against an old rival; Glasgow Roller Derby’s Maiden Grrders, a team the Tayzers had yet to record a win against. After a brilliant match-up between the two teams, the Tayzers managed to pull off a memorable victory defeating the Maidens 181 -143.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November held the final games for the Rising Stars who were trying to maintain their 100% record in their debut season. Two victories against Voodoo Roller Dollies and Bairn City’s Central Belters saw the Rising Stars achieve this record and with it brought the end of a memorable season for DRG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five of DRG headed off to Dallas in December for the Blood and Thunder Roller Derby World Cup in Dallas, Texas. Representing the league were; Milky (Team Scotland Skater), Jill Antonic (Team Scotland Manager), Righteous Oxide (member of referee crew), Crazily InSanne (Team Netherlands Skater) and Twiggy Ramirez (Volunteer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014 was a fantastic season for DRG with some tense victories, heart-breaking losses and masses of experience gained. With the development of the British Championships, DRG are looking forward to 2015 with a positive outlook and great expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>2014 in review</category><category>articles</category><category>drg</category><category>dundee roller girls</category><category>review of the year</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/12/28/dundee-roller-girls-roundup-of-2014/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2014 09:33:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Capital City Roller Derby – Round-up of 2014</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/12/25/capital-city-roller-derby-round-up-of-2014/</link><dc:creator>despicablev</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2014 was always going to be a great year for men’s roller derby, with the first ever Men’s World Cup taking place on UK soil in mid march, which we were lucky enough to have some of our own skaters (Tequila, Despicable V, Dafty) representing Power Scotland in the tournament on and off track. In the end Power of Scotland finished in joint 7th place with Argentina firmly putting Scottish Men’s derby on the map and played one the crowd favorites and most memorable games of the tournament when they took on the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/pos-vs-usa.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-4427 " src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/pos-vs-usa.jpg?w=614" alt="Picture by Dave McLeavy" width="500" height="281"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Picture by Dave McLeavy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Scotland we now have Men’s leagues covering Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Central Scotland, so it's safe to say the future of the men's game is brighter than ever and it's an incredibly exciting time for all involved. Especially now that the location of the 2016 Men’s World cup has recently been announced and Power of Scotland is now laying out the time frame for try-outs and team selection to make the team for the 2016 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the start of 2014 we knew our year was going to be a challenging and one at Capital City, as it was year two of our league. The second year of any league is usually a pivotal one, as it is when most start bouting. This usually heralds changes for any league, as they look to travel to play opponents or put on their own games, as well as a change in focus with training. Although we had made changes last year to our training we knew we had to adapt our advanced training to be more targeted towards game play and tactics. As these aspects of training are vital for all skaters so they can get a feel and focus for how the team is going to play as well as a better understanding of whats going on, on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who has been involved in putting on a leagues first bout, they will know the sheer amount of work that is needed. As well as involvement from all the league members and the large costs the league need to deal with. At Capital City we are lucky that the vast majority of our members are all very involved with the running of things behind the scenes. The whole league knew and were constantly working towards  one of our main goals for 2014, which was to start bouting. This brought with it some challenges as we have always said we wanted to bout with a full roster of CCRD skaters and no guests, but recruitment during 2013 had been a bit hit and miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recruitment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really tried to push our fresh meat taster sessions throughout the year, in the hope of bringing in some new faces to help fill our ranks and get a full squad of 14 to play. Unfortunately, 2014’s recruitment seems to have mimicked 2013's in terms of success. We always generated a lot of interest in our fresh meat taster sessions and people would come along for a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again it was getting people to come back after that, has proven to be the difficult part. From talking to other teams this does seem to be an issue that most men's leagues up and down the country face regularly. However, we have been slightly more successful than in the past with retention and have seven new faces join our ranks. Bolstering the leagues members to it's highest yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the seven, two (JAKILL3 and Wrighteous) have currently made it up to bouting level, with a couple more not far behind and the rest working towards passing their mins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Games&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/chums.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-4425 " src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/chums.jpg?w=614" alt="Belter Skelpies vs Capital Chums" width="557" height="276"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Our co-ed bout with the Bairns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were lucky enough to be approached by Bairn City Rollers earlier in the year, asking if we would like to play them in a co-ed game in July. After agreeing we formed Capital Chums a team comprising Capital City Skaters along with other half's, family and friends of our skaters. The game was a nail biter and entertained the crowd right down to the final whistle until they knew who the winner would be. With a hectic hard fought final jam it ended 166 - 161 to Bairn City Rollers, the bout made such an impression on Bairn City that they awarded it their favorite game of 2014 at their end of year awards ceremony and gave us a trophy to thank us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/ccrd-capitalchums-award.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-4424" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/ccrd-capitalchums-award.jpg?w=614" alt="Receiving our award from the Bairns" width="479" height="319"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Receiving our award from the Bairns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't until November 29th we took to the track again and for the first time as the Mighty Unicorns. This was also to be our first home game. To help us raise funds to pay for costs ahead of the bout, we took a new approach and turned to the public and fans to ask to help through our Indiegogo  crowdfunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only was this our first ever men’s bout, it was our first home bout and Edinburgh's first men's derby headline bout all wrapped up in one. Named “A Bridge too far” it was double header with ARRG’s Cannon Belle’s taking on Malmö’s Crime City Rollers B and then Capital City taking on Bristol's Vice Quads with half time entertainment from Fierce Valley Roller Cubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our opponents Bristol were a bit of an unknown threat, with a few bouts against longer established UK teams already under their belt. Although we entered into the game hoping to win we knew it was going to be a tough task to achieve. From the first whistle it was a hard hitting game that came down once again to the final jam to see who would be victorious. In the end this time it was ourselves who took the honor, winning our first ever game 173 - 164.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/ccrdvsbristol.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-4428 " src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/ccrdvsbristol.jpg?w=614" alt="Picture by Scott Carroll Live Photography" width="505" height="284"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Picture by Scott Carroll Live Photography&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most leagues will know, putting on your first bout is both terrifying and exciting in equal measure. As we are such a small league, finances proved to be the greatest hurdle. Our only real option for a venue was Meadowbank which came in at £900+ for hall hire and had to be paid 2 weeks before the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proved to be our biggest stumbling block as we couldn't pay it from tickets sales on the day. Add to that insurance, track equipment, program printing, EMTs and a host of other smaller costs we knew the league couldn't bankroll the bout without some help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We held a couple of meetings and ran through different options but one kept returning, crowdfunding. As far as we knew no one in Scotland or possibly the UK had run Crowdfunding before to put on a roller derby bout, so we knew it could be a big risk. However we had a back up plan if the crowdfunder didn't work, which a bit simpler. Empty our own pockets to cover the costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We worked hard to put together a list of perks to entice people to donate. Our Idea was to run it like a ticket and merch pre sale, so donating got you entry or merch on the day. We offered the likes of t-shirts, tote bags, caps, bout tickets, personal CCRD strips, songs on the bout day playlist, selecting our skate out song and even blowing the start whistle of the bout. In the hope that we could cover something that most people would want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting a goal to raise proved a difficult task as well. Too little and it wouldn't be enough, too high and we may not make the total and lose all the donations in the process. This did provoke a fair amount of discussion between ourselves and in the end we set our goal at £1200. We knew that it was a large sum to raise but we had confidence that it was achievable. In the end we raised over £200 more than our total when our crowdfunder ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crowdfunder stats
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;109 Backers in total&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Raised £1410 in total&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Average pledge was £13&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Broke our target with a week to spare&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Averaged around £35/day&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All backers bar 1 were from the uk, the other was from Australia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
It is safe to say that everyone who donated to our crowdfunder are our hero’s here at Capital City, as our game wouldn't have been the success that it was if it was not for each and everyone of you, so thank you.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rebrand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may have noticed that this year we went through a little re-brand of our league logo. From very early on we have always been known for our very distinctive unicorn, so it was with great trepidation we looked at reworking our logo. We didn't want to lose the Unicorn but we knew it was time let a professional the chance to see what they came up with. As our original logo was pieced together by our members fairly quickly so we could have a logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/ccrd-oldogo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-4432 size-medium" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/ccrd-oldogo.jpg?w=212" alt="Original CCRD logo" width="212" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Original CCRD logo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We approached Admiral from ARRG in the hope she could come up with something, but not lose what made our old logo stand out. A couple of months later she came back with a design that with a couple of very minor tweaks later became our new logo. We think that you all will agree that she did a fantastic job. Also to coincide with our logo re brand our web guys in the league put their day job talents to good use and put together our first proper website over at &lt;a title="Capital City Roller Derby" href="http://www.capitalcityrollerderby.co.uk/"&gt;capitalcityrollerderby.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/capitalcitylogo-srdb.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-4431 size-medium" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/capitalcitylogo-srdb.jpg?w=300" alt="CCRD New Logo" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CCRD New Logo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Achievements in 2014, what to &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;expect in 2015&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I caught up with Capital City's Captain Tequila Jammer and Vice Captain HaJuken to see what they thought were the leagues achievements in 2014 and what they are looking forward to in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HaJuken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="null"&gt;2014 was the year that people began to believe in Unicorns. We had a very successful year as we began to feel, scrim and play like a team. This was down to a number of factors. Our numbers grew to the point where we could do mini scrims at practice, we have several coaches that were able to teach the rest of the team about their specialties, everyone bringing their A-game to practice every week and having a very dedicated and awesome Captain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tequila Jammer&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_38 direction_ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dundee Rollers Girls have always been instrumental in giving newer skaters their first taste of the game with their awesome coed monthly scrims. I mean if you get hit by Milky you can get hit by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HaJuken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="null"&gt;We had numerous skaters passing their mins and the first thing we say to them when they do is “get your butt to a Dundee Roller Girls Scrim!” Not only is scrimming great experience but the DRG Scrims usually host skaters from numerous different leagues such as Mean City, Granite City Roller Girls and Glasgow Roller Derby. So you also get to meet and skate with some new faces every time you go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tequila Jammer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had our first outing official outing which was in co-ed form was an amazing success. Many CCRD skaters joining forces with local leagues to make the Capital Chums! A tight match up that had everyone in the edge of our seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HaJuken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="null"&gt;Even though the Chums lost by a few points I can safely say that everyone on the team felt like a winner after the amazing performance they put in that day. Who knows, maybe the Chums will reunite and take the win next time?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tequila Jammer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have to mention our first ever game! A BRIDGE TOO FAR! it was a great feeling to see 2 years of training come together in our debut game against the Vice Quads. The atmosphere was top notch and of course it couldn't of even happened without the support of our crowd funding ventures. Thanks again everyone! But seeing everyone come play as a team and Captain them to victory was euphoric feeling. In fact it's not just a team, it's a community and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HaJuken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cant not mention A Bridge too far, Getting to skate together as a team for the first time and knowing your are part of history, there is no feeling like it.  It was definitely a hard fought win though as the lads from Bristol Vice Quad put up a serious fight. There was so much planning, hard work and effort by everyone on the team to make sure this game happened. We had a lot riding on this game being a success and seeing the hall fill up with people just made all the stress disappear on the day. Hearing the crowd erupt when we skated out was a great feeling and I definitely think we gave our fans a great show that day. As for the greatest moment for me this year? Definitely being nominated Vice Captain of CCRD. Knowing that I have teammates who thought I could be Vice Captain just boosted my confidence through the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tequila Jammer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next season we are looking forward to taking part in the newly formed Scottish Men's Roller Derby Nationals where we'll take on the formidable Skelpies and Mean City. Away games are on our agenda too, Bristol rematch and even taking the Unicorns overseas... WHAT?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course we hope to grow in numbers, promote derby and build links with local leagues and our community. So watch out 2015 UNICORNS ARE COMING!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HaJuken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015 we will be looking to really make our mark on the Roller Derby scene by upping the amount of games we are going to play. We want to give back to our dedicated fan base by giving them more chances to see us skate. We have the Scottish Men’s Roller Derby Nationals as well as some away games, can you imagine the Unicorns invading other countries? How awesome would that be!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To all of our fans that have stuck by our sides over the last two years I would just like to say….Thank You! Your support at our first game “A Bridge Too Far” made all of the hard work worth it. We will not disappoint you and in 2015, we are going to show the Roller Derby world what we are made of! U-NI-CORNS! U-NI-CORNS!!&lt;/p&gt;
