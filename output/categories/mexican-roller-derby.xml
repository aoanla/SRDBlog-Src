Sunday also remains a place for scrimmage, though, with many of these events being more informal affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above, remember that there are two open Short Track events this Sunday: the low-contact event in Halifax, and the introduction to Short Track in Worcester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

And, to add to that, this is the weekend of the annual Big Blether Scottish Roller Derby Conference, so all the leagues will be coming together there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also two-day international tournaments in Sweden, the Mexican National Division 2 Championships in Léon, Sudestada Roller Derby's debut bout in Necochea, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

We have two 10th birthdays of leagues, several bootcamps and tournaments (including possibly our favourite one, the Hot Chilli Cup - providing both Junior derby bootcamp and tournament in Australia), and a bunch of exciting derby in Argentina. As there are so many deserving events, we'll be having an addendum to cover significant things in the Sunday-Monday period later in the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also switched to a better map projection (Eckert IV) for this edition, to more accurately represent the scale of the countries and continents of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

Sunday seems to be the preferred day for things in Latin America, with two events in Bogotá (including a collaboration exercise between 4 of the local leagues), one in Mexico, and the previously mentioned Patagonian bootcamp in run by Vendaval in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK, meanwhile is full of bootcamps and mini-bootcamps for all those not at British Champs over the weekend...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

Queensland's state tournament has its Grand Final this Saturday; as does British Championships, with their Playoffs deciding the winners in both divisions. There are several leagues celebrating reaching their 1st decade of existence in various ways, an exciting bootcamp in Cancùn, Mexico, and a lot of roller derby in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

In particular:
not one, but two Australian teams play in the first WFTDA Continental Cup of the season; and the first of two Playoffs for the Mexican National Tournament is held in Chihuahua over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also some high level action in London;  some international roller derby in Buenos Aires for the third weekend running; and a German Bundesliga D1 bout in Munich... plus a fantastic all weekend Bootcamp and officiating clinic in Malmö, Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

national tournaments in Roller Derby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the 2019 edition of the Championships arriving very soon now, we thought it was time to catch you up on events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Mexico City Roller Derby held the #1 spot for the WFTDA-gender division, with Baja California's Baja Roller Derby coming a close second... can this year shake up the dominance of the Mexico City teams?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
