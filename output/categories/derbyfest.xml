&lt;p&gt;Geography informs the way in which Roller Derby develops in a country, and South Africa's is very different to what we're used to in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa is a large country - its area is about twice that of France - but with a relatively small population - about 80% that of France. And that population is very unevenly spread across the country: the dense province of &lt;strong&gt;Gauteng&lt;/strong&gt;, containing Johannesburg and Pretoria, contains about a &lt;em&gt;quarter&lt;/em&gt; of South Africa's entire population, with another fifth concentrated around Durban in the south-east province of &lt;strong&gt;KwaZulu-Hatal&lt;/strong&gt;, and a further eighth around Cape Town in the &lt;strong&gt;Western Cape&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike in most European countries, then, the 4 leagues of South Africa - located in those 4 named cities - have difficulty even travelling to play each other on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add to this the fact that the only other country with Roller Derby in Africa is &lt;em&gt;Egypt&lt;/em&gt;, at the other end of the continent, and you can get a feel for how dedicated and unique the solutions adapted by the South African leagues have had to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we'll be discussing in some depth both those problems, and their solutions, so click on to read more:&lt;/p&gt;
