February saw the Womens Roller Derby World Cup blow everyone away and now, thankfully, we are past its comedown. But it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; time to get ready for the Men’s Roller Derby World Cup, which kicks off on the 5th of April in Barcelona. This is the third MRDWC; the first was held in England back in 2014, and the second was two years ago in Canada. Back at the first World Cup in 2014, 15 nations battled it out, that tally rose to 21 in Canada, and this year at Barcelona there will be 24 nations represented, with even more set to join in at the next MRDWC after this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/PowerOfScotland/"&gt;Power of Scotland&lt;/a&gt; has featured at every MRDWC so far with its roster comprised of skaters from all over Scotland, as well as some from South of the border. From the first MRDWC to the current POS lineup going to Barcelona, &lt;a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers/"&gt;Bairn City Rollers&lt;/a&gt; has had its skaters featured in each of the squads. BCR's Gibb is one of only three skaters in the current PoS roster who have been present on all three of Power of Scotland’s final World Cup squads to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-26515 size-large" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/03/20180321_204818.jpg?w=700" alt="Power of Scotland and Bairn City Skater Gibb #5" width="700" height="351"&gt; Power of Scotland and Bairn City Skater Gibb #5 (Credit: Andy Mo Photography)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the first World Cup &lt;a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers/"&gt;BCR&lt;/a&gt;’s current or past skaters accounted for over quarter of the POS squad. At the last MRDWC in 2016, six current or past BCR skaters made it onto the training squad, of which four made it into the final squad that traveled to Canada. This time around, partially thanks to injuries and retirements, they have two skaters who made the training squad and both will be at Barcelona with Power of Scotland. One will be skating (Gibb) and the other now as part of the staff (rEd Baron).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCR are proud that they have skaters once again involved with of Power of Scotland at this World Cup. They are also very proud of their skaters' (past and present) achievements representing and playing for Power of Scotland since its inception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-26514 size-large" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/03/20180321_204752.jpg?w=700" alt="Power of Scotland and Bairn City skater Red Baron" width="700" height="352"&gt; Power of Scotland and Bairn City skater rEd Baron (Credit: Andy Mo Photography)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst we are used to seeing some faces from outside of Scotland in POS squads, we are not used to seeing our male skaters in Scotland appearing elsewhere on other National teams. That was until now! At this MRDWC there will be a couple of skaters that play and train in Scotland who will be representing nations other than Scotland, and both hail from Bairn City Rollers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers/"&gt;BCR&lt;/a&gt; are incredibly honoured and proud to say that in their ranks they have skaters who will be representing not one, not even two, but three different nations at Barcelona. On the track at the tournament along with Gibb representing Power of Scotland they will have Oliver lining up for &lt;a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/WalesMensRollerDerby/"&gt;Team Wales&lt;/a&gt; and Vezzani for &lt;a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/mensrollerderbyteamitaly/"&gt;Team Italy&lt;/a&gt;.
If you follow Men’s Derby in Scotland Oliver and Vezzani’s faces will be familiar but perhaps their names not-so-much: they have opted, like many, to play under their real surnames. Normally you would see Oliver playing under his derby name of Basha ROO, and Vezzani as Despicable V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-26512 size-large" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/03/20180321_204624.jpg?w=700" alt="Team Italy and Bairn City skater Vezzani (Despicable V)" width="700" height="352"&gt; Team Italy and Bairn City skater Vezzani (Despicable V)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Oliver and Vezzani in their past have represented Power of Scotland (both made the 2016 training squad), with Vezzani representing POS at the first MRDWC. Both have now decided that, going forward, they wish to represent other nations instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-26513 size-large" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/03/20180321_204726.jpg?w=700" alt="Team Wales and Bairn City skater Oliver (Basha ROO)" width="700" height="352"&gt; Team Wales and Bairn City skater Oliver (Basha ROO)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to Oliver about why he decided to try out for Wales he said:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;My mum's side of the family are all from Wales and are passionately Welsh, even my Gran who was originally from Birmingham, so it was a bit of a no brainer to play for Team Wales when I got the chance. The last World Cup, I couldn't commit to traveling down to Wales for training regularly and flying to Canada, financially and work wise. Thankfully this time round I was in a position to be able to.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Vezzani has a similar story for Italy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;At the first MRDWC there was no Team Italy, currently in Italy there are really no Men’s teams/leagues. They do have the Woodgang, which is a team made up of skaters from all over Italy and a few other places. A little like how we had the Jakey Bites here in Scotland. When I tried out for POS for the 2016 World Cup there was no Team Italy, they only appeared very late in the day after I had already made the POS training squad.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When I didn’t make the final 20, quite a few people said to me about trying out for Italy instead. But because I had already made one countries training squad for that world cup I decided against it. Although when I watched and cheered on Italy at the World Cup I realised then, I really wished I had. At that point I decided that if I was going to try out for any Nation going forward it was going to be Italy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
We also asked both how friends, family and team mates reacted when they found out that they would be representing Wales or Italy.
&lt;p&gt;Oliver:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Family have been really supportive about me playing in the World Cup for Wales, so much so that they are coming to Barcelona to come and watch. My mum's gone full Welsh fan-girl so expect lots of daffodils and dragons, lol. My team mates are pleased for me as well although a few wished I had picked Power of Scotland instead.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Vezzani:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;When it came to trying out last year, I had told a couple of people that I had wanted to but never told anyone when I was actually going to do it. It was only when I played my first game for Italy in November last year (at the Road to Barcelona tournament in Holland) that everyone found out I had tried that also included 99% of BCR as I had managed to keep it a secret. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The response from friends and teammates has been fantastic and everyone has been really supportive. My dad is really proud and happy that I will be representing Italy and my sister seems to be the most excited by it all, even more than me. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
We all know that at the previous MRDWCs, Scotland’s fans have become well known for their support, sheer volume, and chanting for not only for Scotland but other Nations they take a liking to.
Seeing as both Oliver and Vezzani are Scotland-based skaters, they will be hoping that they will get some support from the Scottish fans when they take to the track in Barcelona. Here at SRD, we do hope that the Scottish fans at Barcelona and back home will be celebrating and cheering on both of these skaters, and the Welsh and Italian teams.. at least, when they are not playing against Power of Scotland!&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>bairn city rollers</category><category>bcr</category><category>men's roller derby world cup</category><category>mrdwc</category><category>mrdwc 2018</category><category>power of scotland</category><category>team italy mens</category><category>team wales mens</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/27/bairn-city-rollers-central-scotlands-international-derby-league/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 10:09:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>MRDWC 2016 Team Review: Men's Roller Derby Japan</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/06/08/mrdwc-2016-team-review-mens-roller-derby-japan/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the second &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://mrdwc.com/"&gt;Men's Roller Derby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, in Calgary July 21-24th, fast approaching, we thought some profiles for the 21 teams competing would be useful. Over the next weeks, we'll be presenting profiles on each team attending, based on interviews and other statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, we have the fan-favourites from 2014's World Cup; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mensrollerderbyjapan.com/"&gt;Men's Roller Derby Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7506" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/06/1473007_138427009676951_1222915006_n.jpg" alt="1473007_138427009676951_1222915006_n" width="744" height="960"&gt; NinJapan Rollers Logo (retained from last World Cup)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time around, the Japanese team were very much the underdogs, both least experienced and also relatively short in roster (11 skaters). While they ended up last in the rankings overall, they played with strong determination and clearly improved in performance over the course of the tournament (as can be seen by their scores against Belgium in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/45959"&gt;initial group rounds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and then &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/47094"&gt;rematched&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the elimination phase). Such was their team spirit that they quickly became the spectators' favourites, and the overwhelming demand for their merchandise led to a pre-order system being established for t-shirts this time around...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team Japan (The Ninjapan Rollers) are placed in &lt;strong&gt;Group Red&lt;/strong&gt;, along with the national teams from USA, Scotland, Ireland, Finland and Mexico. Of these, only Mexico is new to the tournament; Finland, Scotland and Ireland all finished within a place of each other in 2014, grouped solidly in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://mrdwc.com/results/"&gt;middle of the table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. (Team USA needs no reminder of their position in 2014!)
This is also the largest group, due to a few teams dropping out of the tournament earlier on, which slightly increases the difficulty of placement in it, as only the top 2 spots in each group progress to the highest-tier knockout round with a chance at the Tournament 1st place spot - with USA in this group, this means that only 1 spot is really up for grabs here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, however, the Japanese team has a stronger roster, with 16 skaters listed, and most of the skaters from last time returning. Ninjapan Rollers were recruited/managed under the auspices of the Men's Roller Derby Japan group. The team have been practising with the Tokyo and Okinawa based leagues, and also &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1612941555696799/"&gt;held a scrim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; against the international skaters from the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/03/16/the-japan-open-the-other-wftda-first-this-year/"&gt;Japan Open Tournament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  They've also already garnered some additional support at the host venue, with Calgary-local derby photographer GI Jones accepted as their Official Photographer for the Tournament!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7512" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/06/13041037_427493637436952_1003713003488960251_o.jpg?w=1024" alt="13041037_427493637436952_1003713003488960251_o" width="1024" height="428"&gt; Team Japan Uniform 2016 (selected by public vote)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keisuke Ohtsuki, "Bubble" on track, was kind enough to answer some questions about the team's current processes and plans for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With only one team with male (native Japanese) skaters in Japan (Tokyo3Rollers), how did you go recruiting for the team?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2014 World Cup, we felt that our participation suffered from lack of numbers. As a result, we concentrated on the uncovering and training of new players this time, from an early stage. We tried very hard to recruit skaters for MRDWC 2016. Handing out leaflets, talent scouting, playing and running classes for new skaters who are interested in Roller Derby (which is new in Japan), with all of our skaters, friends, family and collaborators. We strove with various activities including the promotion of Roller Derby in Japan, and the promotion of activities up to last September. As a result, we attained six new members, including skaters who converted from other (roller) sports, and one skater from a US league!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last time around, Team Japan won the hearts of the tournament, but unfortunately finished last despite showing great spirit and determination. What are your aims for this time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a big aim for us to also make the competition an environment in which we would also practice as we played.   We did not win any of our bouts in the last World Cup, but still we gained a lot of audience support. So, this experience fed each skater's motivation to live up to the audience's expectation this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We value the team work of the players, and the staff which enables this. In addition, we will try our best to participate with the MRDA's international organisation to promote this great sport more positively, as we are presently doing in our own country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This time around, Team Japan is in the largest group, including Team USA as an opponent! What teams are you most looking forward to playing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we may have lack of experience in the game, even playing one bout is good - it's great to do so with any other national teams! The bout against Team USA, the champions of the last World Cup, holds with it an opportunity to learn many more things, so we are particular excited to play against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After the last World Cup, was there an increase in interest in Roller Derby in Japan?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still have only one male league (Tokyo3Rollers), so the environment is extremely limited at the moment. The overseas leagues from around the world voiced their support to play or practice with us. It's a thing that we were very thankful for, and there was a feeling that we wanted to fly immediately to each country and bout and practice with them for our experience; but, unfortunately, travel costs were too high, and in terms of time commitment is very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, three (mainly U.S. Forces in Japan) WFTDA women's leagues (Tokyo Roller Girls/ Tokyo and Kanagawa, Kokeshi Roller Dolls/ Okinawa, Devil Dog Derby Dames/ Okinawa) in Japan are helping us a lot with shared practices and scrimmage for our training regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of supporters for these sports is increasing little by little in Japan. Of course, this World Cup appearance is a big thing for our promotional activity for Roller Derby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team Japan's &lt;a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/03/27/mens-roller-derby-world-cupschedule-timezone-adjusted/"&gt;first fixture&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament is against Mexico, at midday Thursday 21st (Calgary-local-time) on Track 1, followed by USA on Track 2 at 3pm local time. [The official MRDWC schedule is located here: &lt;a href="http://mrdwc.com/schedule-2016/"&gt;http://mrdwc.com/schedule-2016/&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/p&gt;
