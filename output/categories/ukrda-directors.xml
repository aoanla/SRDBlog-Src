The most recent AGM was held this month, 5th of June, and resulted in a particularly large number of changes to the Directorships, due to retirements and the filling of previously empty posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're giving you a quick overview of the current Directorships and their holders, to help you get to know your organisation.

Outside of UKRDA, she is well known in the world of NSOing around the Oxford area (especially for &lt;a href="https://www.oxfordwheelsofgory.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxford Wheels of Gory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and beyond. A nominee for the Talk Derby To Me NSO Listener Awards in 2017 and 2016, she has officiated at multiple high level events, including the 2017 MRDA Championships, and both the Roller Derby World Cup and the Men's Roller Derby World Cup 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

He may also have been involved in the short-lived attempt to have a roller derby team based in Sealand. He has also continued to announce at high level events, including both World Cups this year.
Stat Man has also previously served as Executive Director of Sanctioning and Games for the MRDA (2017).&lt;/p&gt;
