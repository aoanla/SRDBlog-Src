If you have something you want to say about Roller Derby, then we're happy to work with you to say it - as we have, for example, with Vendaval Roller Derby just this week. Vendaval contacted us to work on this article, and we thought that it was important enough to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few weeks, we're hoping to have a few more guest articles - written entirely by others - as well some features and catchups on more exciting events across the world, returning to some of the national tournaments we covered last year, and some new events for this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we're always open for more articles: we'd like to help amplify the voices of the entire roller derby community, regardless of the language they speak, the country they're in, or the divisions they play in. So, please, get in touch with us, by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/scottish.rollerderby/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:scottishrollerderby@gmail.com"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/scottishrollerderby/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; message; or even WeChat (we can't link to WeChat directly) or WhatsApp. (We're thinking about a VK account, but don't have one yet.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>roller derby</category><category>we need you</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/09/WeNeedYou/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2019 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing's Dragon Bootcamp - the start of an annual tradition!</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/07/rollerderby-bei-2019/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roller Derby in China, and Asia in general (outside of Japan) has always been a widely dispersed community, with initiatives like the Pan-Asian Spring Rollers helping to tie the region together, and share resources sustainably. However, there've been relatively few big "all-day all-round" bootcamps in the region, and, in particular, little for the officiating side of the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it was particularly exciting to hear that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://beijingrollerderby.weebly.com/"&gt;Beijing Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; was hosting a 1-day multi-discipline bootcamp over the Dragon Boat Festival Weekend (8 June) this year. Skaters from all three Chinese-region leagues - Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong - were present, for the all day event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Flyer logo for the Beijing Dragon Bootcamp event." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/07/Beijingbootcamplogo.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked to a few of the attendees for feedback on the event, which included everything from Skate maintenance and "what is Roller Derby", all the way through drills, communication skills, and a final modified-&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com/short-track-roller-derby-resources/"&gt;Short Track&lt;/a&gt; rules scrimmage.&lt;/p&gt;

On August 18th, they will be taking on Granite City's Fight Hawks at Grangemouth Sports Complex.
&lt;p&gt;This is the Belters' first game since early 2017 and sees a few changes to their team. Whilst some skaters have moved on or retired, the Belters have also had some new faces join their squad, including a couple of familiar faces that used to play elsewhere in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fight Hawks had a great year in 2017, winning all five of the games they played. Now in 2018 they already have 3 games under their belt, the most recent a close bout against Dundee Roller Derby's Bonnie Colliders last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glasgow’s own Mean City Roller Derby will welcome Manchester Roller Derby’s Chaos Engine to the town for a showdown soundtracked by everyone from Oasis and The Stone Roses to New Order and The Smiths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Mean City be feeling ‘Supersonic’ with their ‘Wonderwalls’ or will the Chaos Engine skaters be ‘Made of Stone’? We’ll find out on Saturday April 25 at the ARC sportscentre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a very special occasion as Mean City will be joining forces with friends Glasgow Roller Derby to host a double-header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on the bill will be Glasgow Roller Derby’s Cannie Gingers who will be playing Team Metal Legs – a select squad made up of skaters who have suffered and subsequently overcome breaks during the derby career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means fans will be treated to two full games for the price of one – an all-male game and an all-female game – showcasing some of the silkiest skills and high-octane thrills that this wonderful sport has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Muir, Chair of Mean City Roller Derby, said: “I hope as many people as possible come along to the ARC on April 25 – it’s a great opportunity to get to know this wonderful sport, enjoy some groovy tunes and meet some of Scotland’s friendliest skaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no ‘Definitely Maybe’ about it – April 25 is going to be a fantastic celebration of spills, thrills and derby-aches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Get your ticket now – we’ll sell you a full seat, but you’ll be perched on the edge of it when these four teams take to the track.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan added: “We can’t wait to welcome Manchester Roller Derby’s Chaos Engine to town – they are great league and a fantastic group of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And we’re delighted to be hosting a double-header as our good friends at Glasgow Roller Derby take on the magnificent Team Metal Legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come along with all the family – there will be refreshments, merchandise and more on the day too. To quote The Stone Roses - it's ‘What the World is Waiting For’!”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Mean City Roller Derby vs Manchester’s Chaos Engine and Glasgow Roller Derby v Team Metal Legs takes place on Saturday April 25 – from 11.30am at the ARC sportscentre, Glasgow Caledonian University, Cowcaddens Road, Glasgow, G4 0BA.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Tickets cost £6 in advance - £7.50 on the door.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://derbygeek.co.uk/"&gt;Bairn City Rollers&lt;/a&gt; are holding a Roller Derby taster Session. If you fancy going along to see what all the fuss is around one of the fastest growing sports in the world, then contact BCR at the email address on the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/872422139449893/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; event page.
The event takes place at The Mariner Centre, Falkirk on Thursday the 26th of June at 8:30pm. Cost is £5 and kit is available to try.

However, not only has roller derby existed long before WFTDA, or the 2001 revival that lead to its formation in 2005-2006, but it has had, and continues to have, multiple representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from banked-track derby (which differs from WFTDA in more than just the banked track itself), and RollerGame Japan (a highly kinetic, Japanese interpretation of roller derby which has been intermittently popular there since the early 90s), there are two significant flat-track derby interpretations beyond the WFTDA rules that dominate the sport currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them, USARS, is the ruleset sponsored by the USA's Roller Sports body. It has just released its 2014 rules revision, and down in Birmingham the Crash Test Brummies have tested it out in the first ever USARS scrim in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other is the Modern Athletic Derby Endeavour (MADE) rules set. MADE is a project started by skaters who wanted to play a version of derby closer to the 60s/70s derby of Jerry Seltzer's era than the WFTDA rules at the time (2008 to 2009). MADE has rules for both banked and flat-track derby and the MADE organisation allows male, female and co-ed registrations. As USARS is also consciously influenced by earlier versions of derby, this means that MADE, USARS and 70s derby have quite a lot in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the role of Pivot, and the definition of Lead Jammer, are more dynamic in the three rulesets mentioned, compared to WFTDA rules. Once the opposing team has Lead Jammer, the Pivot is eligible to break out to become Active Scorer, replacing the Jammer for that jam; this also limits early power jams, as the Pivot can replace their Jammer as Scorer at any time before that Jammer scores their first point. In addition, "Lead Jammer" status is owned by the Jammer currently in the Lead, not the first Jammer to break through the pack; catching up with and passing the first jammer out to immediately call the jam is a viable tactic (even returning from a power jam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, and other rules differences across the set, make MADE (and USARS) a faster-paced game than WFTDA skaters might be used to. (Of course, pace is not everything in a game by any means, but MADE aficionados in the USA are certainly vocal about their versions' spectator-friendly thrills.) The MADE and USARS rules are also considerably shorter than the point-by-point accuracy of the WFTDA ruleset - MADE2014 comes to 6, and USARS2014 to 14 pages (including ref signals), compared to the 50-60 page lengths of recent WFTDA rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/02/img_0097-2-copy.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-3273" alt="Pivots on scoring passes: not something you see in WFTDA-derby ;) (Photo: Laura MacDonald)" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/02/img_0097-2-copy.jpg?w=614" width="614" height="409"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pivots on scoring passes: not something you see in WFTDA-derby ;) (Photo: Laura MacDonald)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scottish connection comes into this via Bairn City Rollers' Liz Thrilla, who experienced MADE firsthand on her return to Kansas at the tail end of 2013. Enthused by the pacier feel of MADE derby, she decided to give Scotland a taste of the rules, in the interest of promoting a different side to the sport. The MADE In Scotland group is the result of her efforts, and is hoped to result not just in an all-Scottish coed exhibition bout at the end of the year, but also an International bout in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These things start smaller, however, so MADE In Scotland has arranged a series of taster/training sessions to allow the WFTDA-rules community to experience the different ruleset and form their own opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unavoidable clashes with Fierce Valley Roller Girls scrims and Power of Scotland training limited attendance to the first session, held in the Mariners' Centre, Camelon on Saturday 8th. Nevertheless, enough interested parties attended to allow demonstration pack work and drills within the MADE ruleset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the slightly larger MADE track, and the faster pace of the game, all of the skating attendees found the experience more tiring than they were used to, however they also uniformly seemed enthused by the experience. Raven, of Into The Nitemare, was enthused enough to promise to bring the entire Voodoo Roller Dollies to the next session, and the the doodle poll to arrange the date for that has been filled in by several people who did not attend the first session. (At the time of writing, the most popular date seems likely to be the 1st of March).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This correspondent certainly found the pace of the demonstration to be notably higher than that in most WFTDA bouts; however, it should be borne in mind that this was not a full scrim. The full test of how the rules play out will come with a higher turn-out, allowing a fuller experience of a game. That said, I can certainly understand why MADE-fans love their version of the game as much as they appear to.
Of course, we will continue to follow and report on this exciting project as it progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MADE organisation has a &lt;a href="http://www.skatemade.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, where the 6 page rules document can be downloaded, and an official magazine, &lt;a href="http://viciouscirclemag.com/"&gt;Vicious Circle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>made</category><category>made in scotland</category><category>roller derby</category><category>usars</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/02/11/made-in-scotland-from-jammers/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2014 21:59:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Talking Derby To Us: Podcasts come to Scotland</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/02/05/talking-derby-to-us-podcasts-come-to-scotland/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of ways that Roller Derby has been discussed and promoted online and off, from League Websites, through blogs like us, and bigger entities like &lt;a href="http://derbynewsnetwork.com"&gt;Derby News Network&lt;/a&gt;, the derby magazines (the UK's own &lt;a href="http://www.leadjammermag.com/"&gt;Lead Jammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.insidelinemagazine.co.uk/"&gt;Inside Line&lt;/a&gt; amongst them), and YouTube/Vimeo/etc videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcasts, on the other hand, are a somewhat rarer breed, much to the sadness of everyone who wants to listen to people talk about Derby on their daily commute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/02/talkderbytome.png"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3241" alt="No, really, Talk to Them.

&lt;p&gt;The folk up in Aberdeen are well aware of this, however, and have their most talkative member, sMACklemore, (otherwise known with his announcing hat on for Granite City Roller Girls) on the case. He'll be hosting the new derby fortnightly podcast "&lt;strong&gt;Talk Derby To Me&lt;/strong&gt;" starting this very month, with an array of guests from around derby, thanks to the magic of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode 1 is due for release around the &lt;strong&gt;11th of February&lt;/strong&gt;, and will feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCRG Vice Captain (and Team Scotland Training Team member) Rock'n Riot,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCRG Ref (and Scottish Roller Derby Blog contributor) Buffy Boiler,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also GCRG Ref (and holder of longest name in derby) Tessington World of Adventures,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;along with a "mystery guest" from a location "within the UK".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact with the team is currently via their Facebook page here: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/talkderby"&gt;www.facebook.com/talkderby&lt;/a&gt; where they'd welcome anecdotes about your derby Fresh Meat days.&lt;/p&gt;

On Sunday 28th July &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers"&gt;Bairn City Rollers&lt;/a&gt; will evolve to present another double-header of action with Blockémon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For round one, our lovely Central Belters will be hoping the &lt;a href="http://www.furnessfirecrackers.co.uk/"&gt;Furness Firecrackers&lt;/a&gt; don’t prove too hot to handle in what promises to be a searing battle between two great teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the temperatures will reach fever-pitch as it will be time for round two where the Skelpies will be looking to quell the flames of &lt;a href="http://www.furnessfirecrackers.co.uk/mensteam.php"&gt;Barrow Infernos&lt;/a&gt;. If you can stand the heat you’ll be in for a treat, this one might get a little hot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skelpies, Infernos and Firecrackers . . .  all the elements are due to collide at the height of summer in an explosion of fun. Come on down and join us, you’ll have a (poké)ball!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action kicks off 1:30pm at The Peak in Stirling, tickets are moving fast with only a week to go so make sure you grab some while you can.

The entry point for all beginners. Our apprenticeship. But for those looking in from the outside, thinking of dipping their toes in the off-axis oval waters of derby, there can still be a lot of question marks over what Fresh Meat actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our next Fresh Meat taster session on the horizon, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers"&gt;Bairn City Rollers&lt;/a&gt; took a look at some of the more frequent queries from those looking to join Fresh Meat – be it with our league or elsewhere :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/06/fm-poster.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-2722 aligncenter" alt="fm poster" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2013/06/fm-poster.jpg" width="452" height="565"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"I'd love to give it a go, but I can barely skate..."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a problem. Fresh Meat courses will teach you skating from the basics (and we mean &lt;em&gt;the basics&lt;/em&gt;) upwards, so your existing skating ability is irrelevant. One of the first things you will be taught is how to fall safely, so whatever other obstacles you encounter from there you can be confident in not getting hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"It sounds fun, but I don't really know the sport..."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't worry, you're not alone there. Many skaters now at bouting level knew little or nothing about derby when they first tried out Fresh Meat, so it's nothing to be concerned about. One of our skaters believed it to be "something like rugby but on skates", while another saw "an elaborate game of tag". Indeed your own writer was, somewhat embarrassingly, originally under the impression that it was in fact a worked sport like pro-wrestling (even after I started training I still had lingering thoughts that maybe they would smarten me up to it after a couple weeks...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"I don't have all the equipment..."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can bring the enthusiasm, we can bring pretty much all the rest. At BCR we can provide skates and pads in more or less every size for those wanting to give Fresh Meat a go - all you require to bring is your own mouthguard (we don't share &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;!) - and most other leagues will have similar set-ups for beginners to give it a try before looking at investing in their own gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"What will I get out of it?"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A whole new world of fun! Polling some fellow Bairn City Rollers on the matter, here are some of the responses: "Getting my cardio back", "Having a second family", "Confidence", "The most fun ever!". Your writer now tends to mentally arrange his life's timeline by Before Derby and After Derby, such is the scale of changes it makes! It truly is a sport like no other, you'll never know how you lived without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"I'm not sure if I want to be getting hit..."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's an understandable concern, especially if you are starting out with little skate experience, but chances are by the time you've reached that level (and there will be plenty fun training to be had before you get there) your confidence in falling safely and recovering will be such that it won't be an issue any more. Even then, if it's really not going to be your thing then there are plenty other fun and rewarding branches of derby you can go into such as NSO-ing and refereeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"But what if roller derby takes over my life?"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this one may well happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So go on, give it a go! Find out which leagues are closest to you and get in touch. It's a friendly sport that is big on sharing a family ethos, if one league might not be suitable for you they'll be sure to point you in the direction of another one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bairn City Rollers taster session for our next Fresh Meat class will be on the 21st of July.
