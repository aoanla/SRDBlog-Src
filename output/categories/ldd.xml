&lt;img class=" wp-image-6950 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/12321707_525422107661960_6255470024138098836_n.jpg" alt="12321707_525422107661960_6255470024138098836_n.jpg" width="430" height="607"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.7;"&gt;A few members of Lothian Derby Dolls have been spending time at the local indoor skate park over the last few months, pushing themselves out of their comfort zones by getting to grips with skating on an uneven surface and learning new skills and tricks at the same time.  Some have mastered bowls and drop-ins already!  And it’s pretty impressive.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with &lt;a href="http://www.transgressionpark.com"&gt;Transgression Park&lt;/a&gt;, LDD are hosting the very first Quad Skate Night at the venue.  It promises to be a fun and social event, bringing the roller derby community together for a bit of banter and an opportunity to have a go at something a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6957" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/12565422_10153252438310025_8112855549625087405_n.jpg" alt="12565422_10153252438310025_8112855549625087405_n" width="960" height="960"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;LDD's Sam-Awry getting some air&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chicksinbowls.com"&gt;Chicks In Bowls&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was the idea driven by Lady Trample of the Pirate City Rollers, Auckland, New Zealand.  The aim is simple; to inspire people to strap on a pair of skates and have a go at something new.  There are over 200 CIB chapters worldwide, CIB Scotland being a fledgling chapter.  With events such as this at Transgression, it is the hope that word can spread about this different way of skating and the benefits that learning skills in the skate park can have on the track.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See the event page on Facebook for details.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1160296620677643/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/1160296620677643/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lothian Derby Dolls&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;57&lt;/strong&gt; v’s DRG &lt;em&gt;Bonnie Colliders&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;414&lt;/strong&gt;
13 Feb 2016, Jack Kane Sports Centre, Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5808" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/02/12751972_10153290311725025_1687578989_o.jpg" alt="12751972_10153290311725025_1687578989_o" width="1080" height="720"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5807" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/02/12765729_10153290313055025_364153108_o.jpg" alt="12765729_10153290313055025_364153108_o" width="1080" height="720"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first bout of the year for LDD and we fielded a team with mixed levels of experience, with a few skaters injured or away having babies. We felt this was a good opportunity to give our newer skaters some experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="text_exposed_show"&gt; The Bonnie Colliders dominated the game with strong blockers making holes in the LDD walls for nippy jammers to take advantage of.  LDD had a hard time reforming their defensive walls and then lost three skaters from the game due to penalties. The second half was more positive for LDD with Fi-Nix taking an epic star pass from Jugz and Tea Wrecks hitting out her first jammer in competitive play.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="text_exposed_show"&gt;LDD's heads never went down despite getting beaten by such a wide margin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="text_exposed_show"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5806" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/02/12755250_10153290315560025_1787426263_o.jpg" alt="12755250_10153290315560025_1787426263_o" width="1080" height="720"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photograph by Laura MacDonald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="text_exposed_show"&gt;In roller derby things change quickly and we will be training hard until our next bout on the &lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt;th of &lt;strong&gt;March&lt;/strong&gt; against Mean City in Glasgow.  &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1555212058123782/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/1555212058123782/ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lothian Derby Dolls are skating against the Central Belters from Falkirk. This is the second time LDD and the Belters have skated against each other and it promises to be an unmissable bout.

&lt;p&gt;This year the Dolls have focused on bringing structure into the core of the league through setting up a more intensely focused new skater programme, while also still finding the way they wish to run the league as a whole. The Dolls are still a relatively newly formed league still working out what works best for their league ethos and goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there haven't been many public bouts this year, this hasn't meant that the Dolls have lost any of their skating enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/10338404_10154255289410720_3654275510968771121_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-4491 size-medium" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/12/10338404_10154255289410720_3654275510968771121_o.jpg?w=200" alt="Image Courtesy of Ara McBay" width="200" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Image Courtesy of Ara McBay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dolls made the trip down to Coventry to return a game against           Coventry City Derby Dolls back in June this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also held many other non-skating events this year for fundraising for their Fresh Meat programme, and rounded off the year with their charity double-header to raise funds for Alzheimer's Scotland and Children's Hospice Association Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dolls have also announced, back in November, that they will be officially launching their travel team as the "Doll Stars".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon speaking to this year's elected Captain for the Lothian Derby Dolls &lt;strong&gt;Courtney Shove&lt;/strong&gt; we had the following words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your opinion, what has been the highlight of the Dolls year for 2014?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014 has been a tumultuous but exciting year for the dolls. The highlight was the great success of our first structured Fresh Meat programme. Everyone has enjoyed sharing their knowledge and the enthusiasm of the new team members has been a great lift for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your hopes for 2015 for the Dolls?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year is going to be an important year for the Dolls. We are going to be bouting more: we have a few dates lined up already and more in the pipeline. We have lost a few members this year but [also] have some great skaters returning after being off for a break or from injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What type of year would you say the team has had?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, 2014 was a year of great change for the Dolls and I think this is definitely for the best as we are going to emerge as a stronger, more effective, team in 2015. The thing I am most looking forward to for 2015 is our new logo!!!
In summary, while the Lothian Derby Dolls may have seemed quiet on the outside, the Dolls have been furiously working on the inside. In 2015, we shall see what emerges from their cocoon!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>interviews</category><category>ldd</category><category>lothian derby dolls</category><category>review of the year</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/12/23/lothian-derby-dolls-round-up-of-2014/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2014 14:36:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Skate of Ages - Charity Bout 6th December</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/12/02/skate-of-ages-charity-bout-6th-december/</link><dc:creator>aleishaduke</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So thinking all the excitement is over for the year in Roller Derby you would be wrong.
This weekend Lothian Derby Dolls are hosting a charity bout at Meadowbank. Raising funds for 2 selected charities Alzheimers Scotland and Children's Hospice Association Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main event will be a face off between the Golden Oldies a team comprised of 40's and over and the Whipper Snappers a team made up of 25 an unders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be for sure an interesting match up do you think experience will win this bout? Or will the eagerness of the young energy win it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we aren't just going to leave those aged in between out so we are also holding a bout for them to not miss any of the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YES!! A double header all in aid of not just one good cause but two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doors open at 12pm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meadow bank Sports Centre, Edinburgh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tickets - Online £8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;                On the door £9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Lothian Derby Dolls are holding a &lt;strong&gt;taster session for new skaters&lt;/strong&gt; who are interested in seeing what the sport can do for them, what they can achieve in the training programme and give you some &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;experiences you won't forget&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This intake session is not just limited to those who want to play on the track as roller derby skater. We are hoping any budding &lt;strong&gt;Non Skating Officials or Referees&lt;/strong&gt; to come along and take part in our training programme.
If you live in the Lothian area and want to give the taster session a go or know someone who does get in touch.
&lt;strong&gt;Sunday 24th August&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Musselburgh Leisure Centre&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;1pm - 3pm&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

With Inverness' Nasty Nessies covered in a special edition of their Monthly Diary to come, we thought that &lt;a href="http://newtownrollergirls.wordpress.com/"&gt;New Town Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2012/12/31/scotlands-newest-leagues-a-year-in-derby/deadlydivasrollerderby.webs.com"&gt;Deadly Divas Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.shetlandrollerderby.com/"&gt;Shetland Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://lothianderbydolls.com/"&gt;Lothian Derby Dolls&lt;/a&gt; all deserved the time to tell us how they'd been doing over the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Town, based in Livingston, and the Derby Dolls, based in Edinburgh and the Lothians, are near contemporaries, and both have been growing and developing over the past year. Both leagues have spent the past year growing and developing their skills towards passing mins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, after a slow start to the year, everything started coming together for New Town Roller Girls in the last 6 months, their numbers swelling to 18 by the end of this year, with 4 skaters, and referee The Real Scrim Shady, already mins-passed. The league's founder, Hazzard, was keen to credit "Reff Goldblum of FVRG," as "the man that helped us pass our mins and has been a great help to us!", with others being equally positive about the recent attendance by Auld Reekie's Circuit Breaker, and the many other skaters from other leagues who have visited them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ladies in black and electric blue also held their first fundraiser in November, the event also serving as the official unveiling of their newly printed boutfits. If Hazzard was upbeat about roller derby and their place in the community,  "I thought [derby] was amazing from when I first found out about it and all that's really changed is that I've come to know the sport better and love the camaraderie of the community and the sheer fun of being involved!", The Real Scrim Shady was even more positive, stating "First time I went along, it was a bunch of people who didn't even know each other's names, nervously skating round the hall following the instructions of Hazzard and Reff Goldblum. It was fun for sure, but since then everyone knows each other, people push each other to do better and give pointers where needed, there's a noticeable anticipation in the run-up to each session. People look forward to it and, as far as I can see, great progress has been made. It feels like a team now instead of just a bunch of friendly strangers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Town are very much looking forward to having enough team members mins-passed to bout, although the team is divided on who their first opponents should be, with skater Bump-Her Stick-Her feeling that "Fierce Valley seem to be our closest 'buddies' but bouting against them would be terrifying as they are amazing", with Hazzard taking the more conservative choice of close buddies "Deadly Divas Roller Derby could well be our first bout partners but you do never know..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lothian Derby Dolls have advanced slightly faster than their peers in attaining a full roster of mins-passed skaters, aided by their acquiring of experienced derby coach Cain Unstable. Duke Box, speaking to us for the league, mentioned both Cain, and offered "thanks to Lead Jammer Magazine, Inkabilly and Into The Nitemare [derby store]" for their donations and sponsorship. The league also held a successful Halloween themed roller-disco, which had good attendance and promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duke Box was also clear that the Derby Dolls, while branding themselves "a team for the Lothians" with "skaters from all across the Lothian area; Mid, West, East and Edinburgh" have been getting on well with the well-established Auld Reekie in the capital itself. "Having ARRG in Edinburgh has allowed us opportunities both to watch them play and support them" she said, adding that the Derby Dolls "have also had some of our skaters join them in scrimmaging this year and hope to have the chance to more in the future, as we wish for all leagues close to us."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Derby Dolls are now capable of fielding a full roster of skaters, they are cagey about their first bout; an initially prematurely announced inaugural fixture has since been delayed or rescheduled. Whenever their initial bout is held, LDD will be attending the Into The Nitemare store-sponsored 'Battle of Britain' tournament in November. As one of the two unseeded competitors, it will be interesting to see how they fare, and a good learning experience for them in the process (even experienced teams like Glasgow Roller Derby and Auld Reekie find extended tournaments to be an exhausting endeavour).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deadly Divas and Shetland Roller Derby, meanwhile, have both only been recruiting since partway through the year, Shetland having been actively growing since July, and the Divas since September! At this early stage in their existence, a lot of the focus has been on gaining numbers and experience. Shetland's Shock Blocker put a lot of effort into outreach via local press and radio appearances, also providing taster sessions for those unsure to experience the meaning of derby. The Divas leveraged some less conventional internet media, including Gumtree and eBay, but also the Glasgow press. In the end, word-of-mouth, both online via their Facebook and Web pages, and offline via the inability of new roller girls to speak about anything else, may have been their most significant factors, taking them, in the words of founder AJ La Kaos, from "only 3 of us then 2 left; As it stands now in less than 3 months we have around 20 members which is phenomenal!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both have also been welcomed by the derby community, the Divas getting regular support from Glasgow's men's derby team Mean City Roller Derby, as well as the Pan-Scotland Jakey Bites, and turning up to New Town Roller Girls' open practices on Sunday afternoons; Shetland via their closest neighbours Nasty Nessies, who made a flying visit, following on from a visit from the Forth Valley's Bairn City Rollers earlier in the year. For the Divas, AJ La Kaos noted that "Being the second league in Glasgow has brought up a few complications especially with recruiting and sourcing a venue. We try very hard not to step on GRD's toes in both respects with branding ourselves as a south side team", while the advantage of being in the middle of things allows them to "go to as many bouts as possible, its a great way to see the sport in its full glory. It also keeps us motivated seeing what we're all working towards." The Divas have the advantage of ex-GRD skater Viper as their coach, who also serves as their "biggest inspiration in the derby world" according to La Kaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/12/31/scotlands-newest-leagues-a-year-in-derby/704125_411805645558435_407723866_o/" rel="attachment wp-att-2042"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-2042" alt="The Deadly Divas even managed to get themselves into the papers!" src="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/12/704125_411805645558435_407723866_o.jpg" width="614" height="421"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Deadly Divas even managed to get themselves into the papers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the most remote roller derby league in the UK causes the opposite problem for Shetland Roller Derby,  preventing easy access to live derby hosted on the mainland, and to physical skate stores. Shock Blocker said that the team "owes a special place in our hearts to Marshall Lawless (of 5th Blocker Skates [and Glasgow Roller Derby]) for answering all of our questions, and managing to get stuff up to Shetland at a reasonable price".
The remoteness of Shetland also has another effect on the league, in terms of its makeup. While all roller derby leagues have a mix of ages present, Shetland's overall deficit of University-age individuals is reflected in the more mature demographic of the league, as well. This has not limited their advancement, Shock Blocker commenting that "Our skaters have really grown as a team, and we've been supporting each other learning together. It's been amazing to watch people that have never skated get better and better, and we've all certainly learned a lot."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2012 has been a year of great expansion for Scottish Roller Derby, with the four teams above, and Inverness' Nasty Nessies, all making strides towards doubling the number of bouting leagues in the country. By the end of 2013, the community will only be enriched further as each league passes their mins and becomes bout-ready. We asked each of the league representatives what their aims for 2013 were, and they kindly responded with many words. Rather than take them out of context, we present them here unedited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deadly Divas Roller Derby (AJ La Kaos):
&lt;em&gt;2013 will hopefully be a huge year for us as a team, we're working hard towards getting everyone mins passed and having our first proper bout! For me personally, I'm looking forward to that first day on track watching my new family kick some ass: win or lose it won't matter as we're all there for each other and that's all that really matters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shetland Roller Derby (Shock Blocker):
&lt;em&gt;2013 will be our year of getting our team mins passed, trying to attract more skaters, and educating the public a bit more about the sport. We are delighted to receive any skaters who'd like to come up to Shetland, and show them around. If we can gather enough funding, maybe plan a trip to the mainland.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personally, I'd like to improve my skating skills, my understanding of the rules, and hopefully see more bouts in person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the meantime, we at Shetland Roller Derby would like to wish all the Scottish teams a big thank you, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! xx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Town Roller Derby:
(Hazzard)
&lt;em&gt;In the next year we hope to have enough skaters mins passed and experienced to start having some closed door bouts atleast! Then on to the big scary world of open bouts and trying to find somewhere to hold them at home too!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The Real Scrim Shady)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There's still much work to be done, but over the next wee while I'm interested in helping NTRG improve their skating and developing the fitness levels necessary for a bout. I've been skating for years and I like helping other people avoid some mistakes that I made in the process of learning to be comfortable on skates. I want to see all NTRG members be comfortable enough on skates that they can be thinking about the bout rather than worrying about staying on their feet. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I've seen progress in the short time I've been involved, for example 4 skaters passing mins. But I'd like to see training become a bit more intense. Circuit Breaker is coming back to help us with exactly that and I'll try to help Hazzard maintain the level of training and push it harder when the time’s right. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em id="__mceDel"&gt;&lt;em id="__mceDel"&gt;&lt;em id="__mceDel"&gt;&lt;em id="__mceDel"&gt;&lt;em id="__mceDel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As for what I see for myself within the next year, I'm learning about the game pretty quickly right now and I'm looking to get a set of quads (I’m a fruitbooter btw). I aim to gain enough knowledge and understanding of bouts to move on from the role I've already had as NSO. The eventual goal is to become a ref but I don't know just now how long I can expect that to take.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lothian Derby Dolls (Duke Box):
&lt;em&gt;Well 2013 so far does have us taking part in The Battle of Britain; a tournament that is being organised by Into The Nitemare. We also have a couple of things that are being organised bouting wise and will be announced next year when finalised and confirmed. Just a lot more hard work in training and some fun events in store for us also. It is definitely the year the Dolls will make a great one for all our skaters and those who supports us. So a big thanks to all who have got us to the end of 2012 it has been a great start.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No sooner had we issued that opinion, however, then two more showed up!
Lothian Derby-Dolls, declaring themselves as a "Mid-Lothian" based league, founded by a group of experienced skaters late of Auld Reekie; and New Town Roller Girls, based in West Lothian's Livingston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both teams are aware of the recruitment pressure exerted on them; by Edinburgh's Auld Reekie to the North-East, and Fierce Valley to the North-West, but they feel there's enough demand for derby that they can prosper in addition. Indeed, New Town recruit Gill Brannan explained: "the first team I found was Auld Reekie, but the fresh meat seemed infrequent, and New Town is local to me. I was really surprised and happy there was a team here." (Gill has since had to leave New Town for personal reasons).
New Town's initial founders, Hazel "Hazzard" Mochan, Jennifer "JPow" Powell* and Becki "Darko" Lawrie, decided to start the new league in a burst of enthusiasm after having watched Whip It! on DVD. Unaware of the existence of Fierce Valley Roller Girls to the north, and seeing the long wait for the next fresh meat at Auld Reekie, it seemed like the fastest way to get skating would be to do it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/06/dsc01079.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-1302 " title="SONY DSC" src="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/06/dsc01079.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="410"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; New Town co-founder Hazzard directs training at a Sunday session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The going has been slow but steady for New Town in the months since; after growing quietly on a Facebook group page for several months, they exploded into the awareness of the Scottish Roller Derby community after Lead Jammer magazine gave them a plug, but gaining awareness outside of the existing derby community has proved difficult. A concerted leafleting campaign is planned in the near future, as most of the team's previous outreach has been via Facebook and Twitter. Skaters from both Auld Reekie and Fierce Valley have helped with the occasional practise session, as New Town have no experienced coaches amongst them. Initially, the team benefited from sharing practise sessions with Lothian Derby-Dolls, but with LDD growing bigger this has become less possible. Team founder Hazzard has been developing her own coaching skills as a consequence.
New Town's practices are weekly on Sundays, 3 to 6pm at Craigswood Sport Centre, Livingston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While New Town's band of skaters are all new to Derby, Lothian Derby-Dolls have well-experienced founding skaters Psychobeing and Skate-tastrophy, formerly of Auld Reekie. In addition, they've recruited the legendary Cain Unstable as their coach. Cain was involved in the early days of both Glasgow Roller Girls and coached Auld Reekie for their first couple of years, bringing them up to an extremely high standard. The lure of Cain, and the presence of experience skaters hasn't hurt LDD's recruitment; one skater I spoke to had even been recommended to join the league by Dundee's Psychomilly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/06/dsc02485.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-1301 " title="SONY DSC" src="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/06/dsc02485.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="286"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Lothian Derby Dolls recruits lining up for practise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engaging in an impressive structured training plan, Cain hopes to get the first recruits for the Derby-Dolls mins passed and bout ready before the end of the year. With already more than enough members to form a full bouting team, it looks like they might even manage a bout next January.
The Derby-Dolls started with a single practice on Fridays, 7-9pm at Danderhall Community Centre, sharing a Sunday practise with New Town. Since then, Lothian Derby-Dolls have been looking for a new venue for their own Sunday practise, and are no longer sharing with New Town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth spurt for Scottish Roller Derby has not stopped even here. During the process of writing this article, a second Glasgow-based team has just emerged, Glasgow Slayers positioning themselves somewhat in the same relation to GRD as the Derby-Dolls are to Auld Reekie. Unlike LDD, Glasgow Slayers don't come with any direct derby experience; while co-founder Teri Fiher has skated on inlines for years, she's new to quads, let alone hitting people while wearing them, and her comrade-in-derby Lou Natic has no previous skating experience at all. Recruitment is in the initial stages, but seems to be very positive, and Glasgow Roller Derby are being very supportive themselves. As yet, the Slayers have not located a suitable practise venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More speculatively, even Shetland is potentially getting into the act, with a Facebook page only recently renamed from "Anyone interested in Roller Derby in Shetland?" to "Shetland Roller Derby". Despite the remoteness of Shetland, they have already hosted an initial recruitment meeting, and are positive that they can recruit enough members to form a team. This would make them the new holders of the "Most Northerly Team in UK Roller Derby" record, previously held by Nasty Nessies in Inverness (in Europe proper, Scandinavia hosts several new leagues which are much further north than the rest of Europe could ever match, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two taster events for Shetland Roller Derby are planned: one next Sunday on the 10th of June, the other on the 24th. They are linked to from the league's Facebook page.
New Town Roller Girls have a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/New-Town-Roller-Girls/165340106915551"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page: and a very new &lt;a href="http://newtownrollergirls.wordpress.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.
Lothian Derby-Dolls have a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/lothianderbydolls"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page and a &lt;a href="http://lothianderbydolls.com/index.php"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.
Glasgow Slayers can be found on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003637390000"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;
Shetland Roller Derby can also be found on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShetlandRollerDerby"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*JPow has since left New Town in favour of a skating role with Lothian Derby-Dolls; the current chairs of New Town are the remaining two founders, Hazzard and Darko.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>glasgow slayers</category><category>ldd</category><category>lothian derby dolls</category><category>new town roller girls</category><category>ntrg</category><category>shetland roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2012/06/04/the-lothians-get-rolling/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2012 12:14:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Lothian Derby Dolls-Roller Disco</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2012/04/12/lothian-derby-dolls-roller-disco/</link><dc:creator>scottishrollerderby</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/04/ldd-roller-disco.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/04/ldd-roller-disco.jpg" alt="" title="ldd roller disco" width="614" height="433" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
