national tournaments in Roller Derby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the 2019 edition of the Championships arriving very soon now, we thought it was time to catch you up on events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Mexico City Roller Derby held the #1 spot for the WFTDA-gender division, with Baja California's Baja Roller Derby coming a close second... can this year shake up the dominance of the Mexico City teams?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="map of mexico with teams competing in the Division 1 and Division 2 tournaments for 2019 marked with stars." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/07/mexico-2019-teams.png"&gt;

With people travelling across the world to attend, the schedule elsewhere is a little sparse, but there are still exciting things happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also included a bonus section in this week's roundup highlighting sessions at Rollercon itself which we think are either interesting, or important, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This list was updated on Thursday 18th to include late announced bouts on Sunday in Mexico and Argentina&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

This year continues the trend of increasing "worldwide" participation of teams in the post-season - which also means increasing average costs for the sport!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst we would like to congratulate all the teams on making Playoffs or CC, this article isn't just to celebrate them (even though we made a map to drive home the distribution)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thought that providing some hard-ish numbers on costs might be useful, so we did a bit of calculation to feed discussion. More after the break...&lt;/p&gt;

Luckily for us, New Town Roller Derby's Hazzard
was attending, and has been good enough to provide us with this guest article!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 22nd and 23rd of June, 8 Italian roller derby teams and a swathe of officials had arrived at Arena Ritten, just outside of Bolzano in the North of Italy. They were to participate in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/423438998225036/"&gt;Skate Im Ring (SKIR) Golden Edition&lt;/a&gt; [link to Facebook] hosted by the Alp’n Rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The fantastic Arena Ritten, host venue for SKIR 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekend was the 4th edition of the SKIR and was its biggest edition so far.
The tournament consisted of a day of single-period ranking games and a day of full games. The teams were split into two groups and then seeded to go head to head with their counterparts in the other group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting with two of the organisers of SKIR, Betty Burp and Billi, we chatted about the previous editions of SKIR.&lt;/p&gt;

Their two wins in their first two Champs games saw them sit third in their group with six points despite having played one less game than the two teams above them, who had played three each. Their next two games came against those two teams: first they took on North Wales Mens and then T&amp;amp;F: Inglorious B*Stars. Both opponents took the wins in very hard fought games ending their 2019 Champs season 1st and 2nd in the group, 2 weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="British Champs Tier 2 M N leaderboard, showing the current state of play, including BCR at the middle of the table." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/06/MRDAside2-2019.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst those two teams have finished their champs season, the other teams in the group still have one more game and each team still has everything to play for. The last game day of Tier 2 North takes place on Scottish ground, with BCR hosting this fantastic battle at Grangemouth Sports Complex on the 29th of June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This double header could not have been set up more perfectly for the final set of games, as each match is a decider and will see the teams involved fighting for their final position against their opponent. Hosts BCR will be taking on The Inhuman League, with the winner of that game finishing 3rd in the group and the loser coming 4th. Whilst the other game will see Knights of Oldham play Teesside Skate Invaders, with the loser unfortunately ending up with the wooden spoon for the tier, and facing potential relegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both games are shaping up to be quite a close battle as by their results so far each are evenly matched. So every team will be pulling out all the stops to get that final win in this years champs competition to finish above their opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doors are at 1.15pm and tickets are only £5 on the door, find out more and keep up to date on the Facebook event page &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/events/2402082363156371/"&gt;https://en-gb.facebook.com/events/2402082363156371/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're slightly breaking our usual rule this Sunday to allow two events for France. The French schedule of events is so dense, we end up overlooking many of them each weekend in only picking one, so we're selecting two equally important fixtures for this Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://roadkillrollers.nl/"&gt;Roadkill Rollers&lt;/a&gt; host their inaugural "Small Teams Tournament", a one-day event aimed at giving smaller teams more opportunities to play in a tournament environment.

&lt;p&gt;On May 4th 2019 Hulls Angels All-Stars travelled to Denmark to participate in Aalborg Roller Derby’s TNT (The Northern Takedown) Tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the 3rd year Aalborg’s Combat Bullies have hosted a tournament and the first year which HARD has competed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only was the tournament the first international tournament HARD has competed in, it was my first tournament as Captain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the rosters of the other teams (Belfast Roller Derby, Rockcity Rollers, Cologne’s Graveyard Queens and the hosts Aalborg’s Combat Bullies) it was clear that this was going to be a tough tournament! Not only did we have 3 (!) games on the Saturday we were also only taking 9 skaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nerves aside, the key mantra for this weekend was that we were going to play our game which involved lots of phrases such as ‘butts in holes!’ lurrr and slurrrr’ and ‘back, back, back’ like ducks quacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special shout out goes to my Vice-Captain Milv, who not only organised the bulk of the trip but sorted out a cabin in the woods for us to stay in. There was definitely some Friday 13th vibes going on as we walked into the living room to see massive film posters with superimposed Danish politicians’ faces on them! Anyways! Bunk beds were allocated and a food shop to Aldi was done! Thrill Murray cooked up a super tasty pasta salad so we could carb load ready for the following day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aalborg Roller Derby have a fantastic venue and were superb hosts throughout the whole weekend with cracking food provided and a wonderful airy venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first game was against Belfast, and it seemed to fly by! After an anxious start we slowly settled into a rhythm and despite having four(!) foul outs (oops!) we’d cinched our first victory abroad! For me, I was happy with one win as Hulls Angels have never managed to claim a win in Europe before! But our offensive powerhouse Hi-Jaxxx spurred us all on for more as we prepared to take on the top seed of the tournament- Eindhoven’s Rockcity Rollers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that it was this game in which we really started to hit our groove. The first game was full of nervous energy, but here we kept calm and focused and on the game plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the game got underway, our newly promoted All Star jammer Dani was smashing through walls as if they weren’t there, Purdy opened up holes for our jammers whilst simultaneously shutting down the opposition. Rockcity were tough but we were living up to our name. At the end of the game we managed to sneak a narrow victory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two wins down and I was on cloud nine! But we still had our last game of the day to go. Pressure mounted as we realised that if we won this game, we were guaranteed a medal! Bench Coach Rollo made sure we stayed centred and focused as we prepared to close Saturday against Cologne, who like us had also played three games in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although both teams were beginning to run low on energy, Cologne went out hard and fast! We really had to dig in and band together. At times the game could have gone either way! But as the clock ticked down and the final whistle was blown, we could hardly believe we had done it. Three wins in one day and a guaranteed a medal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we all got back to our creepy cabin, had a hot shower and nursed our aches and pains, it actually dawned on us…. What if? What if we could win this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully on the Sunday we only had one game- the hosts Aalborg’s Combat Bullies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Aalborg already having played that day we knew that this would not have given us any advantage. We had been fortunate enough to have watched their previous games and they looked like strong hitters that played a very physical game! We weren’t wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the game got underway, Aalborg had begun to rack up an uncomfortable lead, so a tactical time out was called by Rollo, to focus. This seemed to do the trick, as we went back on track with a new energy. F-Bomb was closing down any enterprising jammers wanting to sneak up the inside line, Melon Collie was the glue of the team, keeping us together and keeping us calm when the pack started to speed up. Frost Spite was defying the laws of physics as she jammed for what must have felt like jam 200! But it was then that the tide began to turn back in our favour! That gold medal was within sniffing distance!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final whistle blew………. and that was it! We’d done it! And I am pretty sure most of us are still wearing out medals now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly feel that this weekend was a mammoth team effort. We could not have skated as well as we did if it was not for our amazing bench crew; Bench Coach Rollo for winning his first official review! Line Up Manager Ju for not losing her head when we may have been losing ours, and Mansfield Roller Derby’s Dragon’s Jen, who was so supportive and quick with the feedback. You were all completely invaluable. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of Hulls Angels All-Stars, I would also like to thank everyone involved in organising and taking part in The Northern Takedown 2019,  the NSOs, referees, announcers, photographers, catering staff, volunteers and Aalborg Roller Derby. For our first European tournament you have set the bar very high! Amanda! We missed you every day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a weekend of sweat ‘taches, strangling goose poses, wooden giants, paracetamol, sunshine and fun. I can’t wait for the next one! Groove is in the Hull!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I won a hat! #winnerwinnerchickendinner&lt;/p&gt;

The two sides had played each other back in 2016, with 2 wins for Colliders to ASTRO's 1. However the inherent nature of constantly altering B/C teams rosters led to this match up being two brand new teams facing each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Photo of Shiv (Colliders Co-Captain)" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/05/shiv-photo-dundee.jpg" style="width: 50%;"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Shiv #165 (Colliders Co-Captain)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;“The ASTROs game was a tough season opener for us and even though we lost we had a fantastic time out on track! We learned a lot about how we work together as a team and it gave us some areas to focus our training on going forward”&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A closely fought game, with the new Colliders being led by Shiv #165 and Macfarlane #606, showed a settling in period for the new Dundee roster with the ASTROs side taking the win [221 v 166]. With a month of training and working together under their belt the Colliders are looking forward to hosting Mansfield Roller derby on the 25th May at the DISC in Dundee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="DRG v Mansfield Banner" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/05/drd-v-mansfield.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Macfarlane #606 (Colliders Co-Captain)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;“Playing against the Astros was a good way to start our season. We knew they would be a challenge but we learned a lot from it.”&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Shiv #165&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;“We’re going into the Mansfield game with a fourteen skater roster which is pretty much unheard of for Dundee! We’ve been working so hard at training and I’m hoping that we see all that hard work come together in the game.”&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A previous match up, again back in 2016, saw the Colliders take on Mansfield B to a 275 v 75 victory. What will 2019 Collider roster have to offer on the against the Mansfield A side? Will Mansfield return South triumphant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Macfarlane #606&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;“We are looking forward to the game this weekend. We've had plenty of time to train together for this game and we are really feeling the benefit of this.”&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this single header opening its doors at 2:50, and the action starting at 3pm, you are ensured some fantastic derby! For more information on the upcoming event, visit the facebook page!&lt;/p&gt;

Whilst some members of the league were busy;
the league not as much. Although BCR had members involved in the Men’s Roller Derby World Cup
covering Power of Scotland, Wales and Italy squads (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/27/bairn-city-rollers-central-scotlands-international-derby-league/"&gt;read more about that here&lt;/a&gt;), each of their
three teams at BCR (Women’s, OTA &amp;amp; Men’s) only managed 1 game each in the whole year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many other leagues up and down the country, BCR saw quite a few members retire from Derby
after years of involvement and even a couple move on to other leagues. With numbers shrinking,
BCR looked towards recruitment and, after a positive meeting with GMRD, the two leagues decided to
pool resources and started sharing one training session a week. This helped both leagues save
on hall costs, whilst at the same time helping with numbers at training, allowing them to run better
and more complex drills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During those difficult times BCR were always looking forward and, with 2019 in mind, they decided
to enter into &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishchamps.com/"&gt;British Champs&lt;/a&gt; for the second time, having previously competed in 2017. Unlike their previous
entry to Champs as the Skelpies, this time around BCR decided to enter the OTA team. Again
they find themselves in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishchamps.com/league-tables/t2m/north/"&gt;MRDA-Tier 2 North&lt;/a&gt;, but this time as the only OTA team in the tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, BCR have already played their first two of five games in Champs. On February 9th they
travelled down to Manchester to take on Knights of Oldham at the Thunderdome. After an early rise
for most of the team to travel down they took the win, 209 to 108.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to April 20th and
again they were on the road down South, but this time to Middlesbrough to take on Teesside Skate Invaders
(TSI). The last time BCR were in Champs, as the Skelpies, their last game of the tier was against TSI, where
BCR lost by 20 points. This time around however BCR’s OTA took the win, 180 to 136.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Bairn City Rollers OTA Roster [Photo: Bairn City Rollers]" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/05/bcr-article-group1.png"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Bairn City Rollers OTA Roster [Photo: Bairn City Rollers]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week, they will be road tripping to Newcastle to play current tier #1, North Wales Roller Derby Men's. Then, in June,
they have a trip away to Wales to play Newcastle's Tyne and Fear B, before their final game of Champs at the end of June.
BCR will be hosting the final game day of the tier in a double header at Grangemouth on June 29th where they
will skate against The Inhuman League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With two wins in Champs so far, BCR OTA sit third in their group with six points despite
having played one less game than the teams second and first (thanks to an unbroken set of wins).
Those two wins have led to a significant increase in BCR's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings/coed/coed_europe"&gt;Flat Track Stats Global&lt;/a&gt; ranking. BCR OTA are now ranked 3rd in Europe and 20th overall of all OTA teams
on Flat Track Stats (FTS calls this selection "Co-Ed" still).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;British Champs Tier-2 MN Results Table (as of 3 May 2019) [Copyright: British Championships]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst their wins in Champs have been a great start for their OTA team, BCR’s Central Belters have also
started their year in winning ways. They have already gotten their first game of the year out of the way taking the win over
GRD’s Maiden Grrders, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/108318"&gt;179 to 149&lt;/a&gt;. That means they have been unbeaten in seven consecutive games, stretching
back to November 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're also starting to see their numbers increase from their recruitment drive, with new skaters and
along with some transfers arriving as well. Along with those new faces, some old ones have reappeared as some retired
skaters from other leagues have decided to pull their skates back on and have choose BCR to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Bairn City Rollers [Photo: Bairn City Rollers]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news doesn’t stop there: Bairn City Rollers have seen their skaters making it onto both Wales' and Power of Scotland's training
squads for the Men’s Roller Derby World Cup 2020. There is also the possibility of a BCR member appearing on the Team Italy squad, with
tryouts still taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more games penned for the rest of 2019 for their Women’s and OTA team, this year is starting to look like a good one for
BCR and its members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their first home game of the season will be BCR’s final Champs game on the 29th of June: for more
