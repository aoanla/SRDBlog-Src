To captain was an exhilarating experience and to bout for the first time was phenomenal. I was more nervous about bouting for the first time than captaining my team, but I did feel a responsibility from the start to make sure that everyone's spirits were high and they weren't too nervous and were enjoying themselves. Even though in the upcoming days I was extremely conflicted about my feelings towards my bout the second the first whistle blew the nerves were replaced by what I can only describe as determination and adrenaline rush combined. I was very proud of my team, and the other team as we all did so well, afterwards I won MVP during the awards and I was completely overjoyed, overall it was an amazing day I hope to experience again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purple Punisher&lt;/strong&gt;: The bout was meant to be fun and it was just that! Being involved and being captain for the first junior roller derby bout in Scotland was extremely nerve wracking because there was nothing to live up to, we were setting the example. We learnt so much from the bout and the crowd really helped settle the nerves. We made history and being captain was amazing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bout awards were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Jammer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Arch Enemy&lt;/em&gt; (Team White), &lt;em&gt;Haylstone&lt;/em&gt; (Team Black)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Blocker&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Teeny Bash&lt;/em&gt; (Team White), &lt;em&gt;Crimson Crusader&lt;/em&gt; (Team Black)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MVP&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Bon Jodie&lt;/em&gt; (Team White), &lt;em&gt;Stunaimi&lt;/em&gt; (Team Black)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bout report</category><category>bout reports</category><category>fierce valley roller cubs</category><category>fvrc</category><category>interviews</category><category>intraleague</category><category>junior derby</category><category>junior roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/07/15/fierce-valley-roller-cubs-make-derby-history/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2014 19:44:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Bout Report: GCRG Intraleague: Slaughtership Down 12 Feb 2012 </title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2012/02/18/bout-report-gcrg-intraleague-slaughtership-down-12-feb-2012/</link><dc:creator>scottishrollerderby</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/02/sdownpic.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/02/sdownpic.jpg" alt="" title="sdownpic" width="614" height="365" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-875"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
