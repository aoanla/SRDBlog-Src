If you have something you want to say about Roller Derby, then we're happy to work with you to say it - as we have, for example, with Vendaval Roller Derby just this week. Vendaval contacted us to work on this article, and we thought that it was important enough to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few weeks, we're hoping to have a few more guest articles - written entirely by others - as well some features and catchups on more exciting events across the world, returning to some of the national tournaments we covered last year, and some new events for this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we're always open for more articles: we'd like to help amplify the voices of the entire roller derby community, regardless of the language they speak, the country they're in, or the divisions they play in. So, please, get in touch with us, by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/scottish.rollerderby/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:scottishrollerderby@gmail.com"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/scottishrollerderby/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; message; or even WeChat (we can't link to WeChat directly) or WhatsApp. (We're thinking about a VK account, but don't have one yet.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>roller derby</category><category>we need you</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/09/WeNeedYou/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2019 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>We Need You! </title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/04/we-need-you-2019/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roller Derby is a worldwide sport, and there's far too much to cover just with our internal posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a reminder, then, that the Scottish Roller Derby Blog is happy to host guest posts from anywhere in the world of Roller Derby.
(We'd prefer English-language, but we would also consider content in other languages, especially if this raises awareness of a particular community.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already host a regular Guest column with Speedy Convalesce... but we'd like to see more people writing, especially from places which need more attention: Latin America, Asia, New Zealand, and Africa.
(If you're not on one of those regions, that doesn't mean we're not interested, but those regions are particularly in need of representation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd also value more input from the Scottish community where we're hosted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new format and hosting of SRD, there are lots of ways to get guest posts to us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can link us to a Google Doc with your article in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can send us a link to a PDF or a Word document with your article (we'd prefer PDF).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can send us a document in Restructured Text or Markdown format, with attached images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or you can contact us directly by email, or social media, to discuss your idea for an article, and work with us on how best to produce it. (Our &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:scottishrollerderby@gmail.com"&gt;email address&lt;/a&gt; is at the bottom of every page of the blog, and we're available on
