&lt;p&gt;The first is the the already complete &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://euroderbytournament.eu/"&gt;European Roller Derby Tournament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, held in Mons, Belgium. The second will be Team Wales Roller Derby's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1224163900948144/"&gt;"The Road To TBC"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, scheduled for the &lt;strong&gt;26&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;27th&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;November&lt;/strong&gt; 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the two tournaments, we will get a good look at most of Europe's competitors in the Third World Cup, albeit at an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attending the European Roller Derby Tournament were &lt;strong&gt;France&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Belgium&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Wales&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Spain&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Denmark&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Switzerland&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Portugal&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Italy&lt;/strong&gt; and new team &lt;strong&gt;Iceland&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Road To TBC will bring you &lt;strong&gt;France&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Wales&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Belgium&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Spain&lt;/strong&gt; again, with the addition of &lt;strong&gt;Scotland&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sweden&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;West Indies&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ireland&lt;/strong&gt; all showing their national team debuts at the event!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what can we predict, if anything, about The Road to TBC from what has come &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we can look at ERDT. Whilst only 50% of the lineup overlaps between ERDT and TRtT, we can judge some expectations about absolute strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the now-traditional Bayesian inferred strength charts from ERDT, with the top four teams also singled out in separate highlights [as usual, these charts are relative to the winner - in this case, France - and so they are not directly represented]. We've marked vertical lines to show the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/12/20/roller-derby-international-rankings-2014/"&gt;performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (also relative to France) in the Blood &amp;amp; Thunder Women's World Cup 2014, for those teams who attended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids="8997,9001,8998,8999,9000" type="slideshow" link="file"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is pretty clear, whilst Spain is just about separate from the top three, although closely competitive with Wales and Belgium; the distributions for Belgium and Wales are almost indistinguishable. While France was indisputably the strongest team at ERDT, it's reasonable to suggest that the tournament also showed that Belgium and Wales are almost identical in strength. (Wales was the victim of one of the classic problems with single elimination tournaments, being relegated to the consolation brackets by an early encounter with the eventual Champions, and achieved Third as their highest possible relegation place.)
It's also possible to see that, assuming France is still relatively similar in strength, that Wales, Spain and Portugal have all noticeably improved in strength from 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/10/02/the-road-to-tbc-lessons-from-erdt-and-the-last-world-cup/2/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over the page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we'll talk about the teams at The Road to TBC in more detail...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we can expect the hosts to be strong competitors in November... but what about their challengers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9075" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/14448951_1432178393465450_4812609206374398804_n.jpg?w=600" alt="14448951_1432178393465450_4812609206374398804_n" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/12/20/roller-derby-international-rankings-2014/"&gt;back at the last World Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sweden&lt;/em&gt; was one of the strongest teams in the tournament, reflecting the strength of Scandinavian Roller Derby even back then. Since then, Swedish roller derby has gone from strength to strength, with both Stockholm Roller Derby and Crime City Rollers in WFTDA Division 1 Playoffs this year!
A quick count of their recently published training team for 2016/17 [&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamswedenrollerderby/photos/a.517256094957689.143365.224501220899846/1432139023469387/?type=1&amp;amp;theater"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;] suggests that at least &lt;em&gt;13&lt;/em&gt; of the skaters from 2014 are returning as possible rosters (as several skaters were recorded under their legal names for the 2014 roster, and under their skatenames here, it's a little tricky to be 100% certain).
We expect, on the balance of this, and the general health of Swedish derby, for Sweden to be a contender for the top spot at The Road to TBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3901" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/09/teamfrance.png?w=570" alt="TeamFrance" width="285" height="300"&gt; Team France logo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team France&lt;/em&gt; were a top 8 team for us in 2014 (although they narrowly missed the actual final 8 at the tournament itself. We see at least 12 skaters from 2014 in the 2016 roster so far, which is about an average rate of returns in Europe. Almost 50% of the roster is drawn from Paris and Toulouse (with the rest mostly from the other strong French leagues), and both teams have experienced strong growth since 2014. Paris Rollergirls, in particular, have rocketed up the WFTDA rankings in the last two years, currently at #77 in the World.
We would consider France to be one of our three contenders for 2nd place, with chance at taking on Sweden for the top spot too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Belgium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wales&lt;/em&gt;, as we mentioned above, statistically drew at ERDT. At the 2014 World Cup, Belgium was the stronger team, by some distance, so this represents a particular improvement on Wales's part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9087" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/1957831_642788809139747_4859931912064326634_o.jpg?w=600" alt="1957831_642788809139747_4859931912064326634_o" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the composition of 2016 &lt;em&gt;Team Wales&lt;/em&gt; is quite different to that in 2014, with only a handful of skaters shared betwen the two rosters. What is still true, however, is the dominance of Tiger Bay Brawlers and Swansea City Roller Derby in the training team, making up 18 of the 30 spots. Both teams have have exceptional years, with Swansea City particularly excelling at British Champs (where they defeated all comers in promotion to Tier 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3897" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/09/teambelgium.jpg?w=582" alt="TeamBelgium" width="291" height="300"&gt; Team Belgium logo: Anouk Paepen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Belgium&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile have at least 14 skaters returning from the strong 2014 roster in 2016. Belgian Roller Derby has always been pretty strong, on the basis of Gent Go-Go Rollergirls and One Love Roller Dolls amongst their many teams. However, we've not seen, perhaps, the explosive performance increase that, for example, Scandinavia has. We'd say that Team Belgium is, indeed, about as strong as it was in 2014.
We expect Wales to be keen on taking on Belgium on their home turf, and cautiously predict a win for the hosts on this basis. Overall rankings are hard to predict, but there are some particularly strong teams competing in The Road to TBC, and we wonder if the battle here will be for 4th place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3842" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/09/teamspain.jpg?w=600" alt="Team Spain logo -" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, &lt;em&gt;Spain&lt;/em&gt; have clearly come on in leaps and bounds.
The 2014 Team Spain consisted almost entirely of skaters from Barcelona and Tenerife, along with a few from outside Spain. The 2016 Training Team contains 13 skaters from 2014, but a huge number of new faces. We expect that Barcelona and Tenerife will still be strongly represented, however, and note that both leagues have significantly improved their rankings in the last 2 years (Tenerife has a steadily increasing ranking on Flat Track Stats, with no drops at all over that period!). We'd say that Spain have a good chance of placing well, assuming no surprises - although the general strength of teams at The Road to TBC is also higher than ERDT, so another 4th place is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3773" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/09/teamwestindies.jpg?w=424" alt="Team West Indies Logo" width="212" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team West Indies&lt;/em&gt; was new to the Roller Derby scene in 2014, and also had the aim of trying to promote the sport back in the West Indies itself, with all of the skaters being from leagues outside of the islands (and many from the UK). Two years later, it seems that they're planning even greater things - but there's no official roster published for the team to date. We gather that Birmingham Blitz Dames and London Rockin' Rollers are still the core of the UK branch of the team, however, and both teams have had strong years - the Blitz Dames in particular benefitting from a change of coaching style which has improved their performance. While we rated West Indies as a little weaker than Spain and Wales in 2014, we wouldn't rule out surprising things from the team after 2 more years to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4007" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/10/team-ireland.jpg?w=600" alt="team ireland" width="300" height="300"&gt; Team France logo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Ireland Roller Derby&lt;/em&gt; did pretty well at the 2014 World Cup - in fact, on some metrics, we considered them competitive with France! The 2016 iteration is totally unknown, however - they're literally recruiting and selecting as we write this. On the basis of the performance of Dublin Roller Derby (who recently had a US trip and came back even stronger), we wouldn't rule the new Team Ireland out of a top 3 spot in this tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9080" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/14390622_1111812092237414_410042907831655880_n.png?w=600" alt="14390622_1111812092237414_410042907831655880_n" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we come to our local team: &lt;em&gt;Team Scotland&lt;/em&gt;!
Scotland performed very creditably in the 2014 World Cup, placing around 10/11th place by our calculations. In 2014, the Scotland team was strongly dominated by Glasgow Roller Derby and Auld Reekie Roller Girls, with only a few skaters from Granite City, 1 from Dundee, and 1 each from Seaside Sirens and London Rollergirls.
This time around, due to both changes at Glasgow, and the strong growth in strength at Dundee and Granite City, we have a more rounded mix of representation in the training team (5 skaters from Dundee, and one from Fierce Valley!); as well as more skaters from outside Scotland itself, with 2 from Wirral, 2 from Newcastle and 1 each from Hallam, Leicester, London Rockin' Rollers!
We're not sure how the team roster for Team Scotland has been selected for The Road to TBC, but we've seen the team in practice, and they look pretty cohesive already. We'd tip Scotland for a chance at upsetting Ireland's dreams of a Top 3 spot, if anyone does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the only way to actually see if we're right is to make your way to Cardiff for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1224163900948144/"&gt;The Road to TBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; itself. Ticket sales are open for the &lt;strong&gt;26th&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;27th November,&lt;/strong&gt; and sales are going fast, we believe!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>european roller derby tournament</category><category>international derby</category><category>roller derby world cup 2014</category><category>statistics</category><category>team belgium</category><category>team france</category><category>team ireland</category><category>team scotland</category><category>team spain</category><category>team sweden</category><category>team wales</category><category>team west indies</category><category>the road to tbc</category><category>upcoming bouts</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/10/02/the-road-to-tbc-lessons-from-erdt-and-the-last-world-cup/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2016 10:36:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>World Cup 2014: Africa and Asia-Pacific Round-up</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/09/22/world-cup-2014-africa-and-asia-pacific-round-up/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're one week into our series of National Teams interviews, covering all of the teams entering the &lt;a href="http://rollerderbyworldcup.com/"&gt;Blood &amp;amp; Thunder 2014 Roller Derby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked to London Rockin Rollers and Team West Indies skater DisorderLee about her team a few weeks ago via the medium of the Internet. This article is slightly edited from the freeform conversation we had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/09/teamwestindies.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-3773 aligncenter" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/09/teamwestindies.jpg" alt="Team West Indies Logo" width="660" height="933"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, getting straight to the most unusual thing about Team West Indies - you appear to be the only national team based in a region with no local leagues?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=":z6" class="aOT"&gt;Technically, to answer your question, Puerto Rico is part of the West Indies and there is roller derby there. [Since this interview, we have heard news of a Team Barbados starting up as well.]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":z8" class="aOT"&gt;It's a little bit splitting hairs since most people think of it as Latin America, I guess, but we wanted really to represent the islands of our heritage where derby may not have a foothold &lt;em&gt;yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":11m" class="aOT"&gt;We have a born and bred Trinidadian on the team in Mah-Ko so maybe slowly the word will get back and we end up starting something that can be carried on by others.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":xc" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So this is an impetus to build more derby in the West Indies as well as a National Team?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":xd" class="aOT"&gt;If that comes out of it than so much the good - I don't think I want to say we are taking it to them when we are, for the most part, based here [in the UK]. If there are a couple of people who play and/or a league starting up and they see us and want to take over, that's great!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":u6" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given your unusual origins compared to most of the National Teams, how did recruitment + selection happen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":u8" class="aOT"&gt;We cast around for people we knew of that might be eligible - we put out a call on facebook.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":xf" class="aOT"&gt;I ended speaking to people about it at the Men's World Cup as well, as we were selling shirts and badges there.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":xg" class="aOT"&gt;The MWC was a good recruitment drive actually - I mean, who wouldn't want to be part of something like that if they could?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":xh" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indeed!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":xi" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone is very enthusiastic about you as a team...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aOT"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;
&lt;div class="aO2"&gt; That's probably cos we're a bit of an unknown quantity.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":ub" class="aOT"&gt;People don't really know what to expect from us (well, some of the Irish do cos they've played us now) but we are hoping to improve on our last performance.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":14l" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With, say, England, you can guess at performance from LRG and so on. With you guys...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":15o" class="aOT"&gt;Exactly - and factor in the Middleborough girls who are super awesome!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":15n" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are tons of great skaters from other leagues in there! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, with the sign up process, did you have to turn people away / have selection rounds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":xk" class="aOT"&gt;No, actually because there just aren't that many of us: some people expressed interest but dropped out because they didn't think they could get the relevant paperwork or couldn't commit time-/money-wise.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":uc" class="aOT"&gt;So there weren't try-outs &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;, the first step was immediately, how do we work it so we can skate together and get to know each other's styles - that kind of thing. And, the main problem for leagues, never mind national teams, is halls: finding them, keeping them, paying for them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aOT"&gt;We are all in very active leagues it seems, all working hard,  so it's google docs and trying to find that time and scrimmaging against people where we can.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aOT"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":ud" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aye, getting enough practice time is important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":ue" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How's your schedule for that working? I know you played Ireland at their bootcamp..&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and will be at the Scotland/Wales/Ireland/West Indies tournament [&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/724704624268299/?ref=22"&gt;Road to Dallas,&lt;/a&gt; hosted by Team Wales on October 18th]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":15k" class="aOT"&gt;Ireland was our first open door event, we'd had a few training sessions and will get another few in before the welsh tourney.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":xl" class="aOT"&gt;For myself, I choked a bit - didn't do things I knew I could, did do things that I don't usually. My teammates coped admirably, but we're looking to improve, we're not complacent and it wasn't an easy bout.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":xm" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about the team now, then, in terms of aims at Dallas?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":uf" class="aOT"&gt;I'm really really optimistic about Dallas and I am really positive about the team - we are, individually, great skaters and we are prepared to put the work we need in to make a good showing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":ug" class="aOT"&gt;Aims I am sure for everyone are the same - go there, score some points, play as hard as we can.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":uh" class="aOT"&gt;For myself, I like to come away from a game knowing I did the best I could: I'm looking for that because I didn't get that at Dublin.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":15j" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think you'll probably be one of the Fan favourites too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":15i" class="aOT"&gt;Ha, the world loves an underdog.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":15h" class="aOT"&gt;I NSO'ed the Men's World Cup and saw how the crowds reacted to Argentina and Japan.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":xn" class="aOT"&gt;No one is going to underestimate the Argentinian men next time!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":15v" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, funds are the other big problem for everyone. I know you have a million crowdfunding things running + merch...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":15u" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":15t" class="aOT"&gt;Yep, refs have personal pages for their Dallas trips and the team are looking for flights and that's without uni[forms], practice halls, all the rest of it..&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":156" class="aOT"&gt;We've got some amazing sponsors but a lot of it is down to us - we've approached business within the black community but we might be at a disadvantage there as you know, most of them will never have heard of roller derby and won't realise that audience that it reaches...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":155" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is the funding + awareness going? I am guessing merch is doing best?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;
&lt;div class="aO1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aO2"&gt; Yep, Zed, who is one of our skaters, she designed the shirts and badges and that has been the thing helping us the most.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":xy" class="aOT"&gt;We've had some personal donations that we're very grateful for, league mates and family members are very behind us.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;
&lt;div class="aO2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aO2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the sponsors are probably most kit sponsors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;
&lt;div class="aO1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aO2"&gt; People already within or with knowledge of the derby community: Atom Wheels, Bridgend skate shop, Queens Of the Sin Bin, Armourflex... Roller Derby City did our scrim stuff. They do what they do very well and they also made our shirts so that was a pretty logical step.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":uy" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a slightly different topic: London Rockin Rollers seem to have skaters in a Lot of National teams this time around - West Indies, Italy, Greece...?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":uz" class="aOT"&gt;6 in total:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":14d" class="aOT"&gt;Ireland (training squad - Lady Lazarus doesn't like to tempt fate), Wales (Blaze of Gory)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":y1" class="aOT"&gt;Dire Ria - Team Greece&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":y2" class="aOT"&gt;Me, Rammit, cookie and Zed on Team WI, Betty on team England and Robscene and Sikki Sixx for Team Italy&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":y3" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think this might make you the most geographically distributed team nationally!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":y4" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it a point of pride or just a reflection of London's mix of nationalities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":y5" class="aOT"&gt;That's London though, hahaha!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":v1" class="aOT"&gt;It's a little of both I think. We are a league that reflects our town - it's diverse, people come here for many reasons, or grew up here and derby has either found us or we've found it&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":14c" class="aOT"&gt;Blitz Dames is very well represented in Team WI and that's another league that reflects the make-up of their city, despite the fact that there are not a lot of ethnic minorities in roller derby over-all.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;
&lt;div class="aO1"&gt;I should also mention that one of our 'indiginous West Indians, She-Rarr, from Sheffield Steel Rollergirls is white;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":y9" class="aOT"&gt;I think people don't know that there are white people in the West Indies.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aOT"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, it is a fact that Derby is still quite a White Anglo-Saxon sport...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aOT"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":ya" class="aOT"&gt;Yeah, I think it's by example - I didn't see players like Mercy or White Flight when I started, I discovered them afterwards, but I think girls coming into derby now have amazing role models in them: in Fright Train, in Mick Swagger, a lot of amazing minority players proving that it's not just 'the sport those crazy white girls play'.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":zc" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...and my favorite UK jammer/blocker Mighty Mighty Bash!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":zd" class="aOT"&gt;I am super lucky to have had her as a coach of mine, and my intraleague captain,and her mum Black Panther came and played in the first LRR Vs SDRD game! Bash was the first person my mum [saw] playing derby that she was like "who is that?" That was last World Cup.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;
&lt;div class="aO1"&gt;Being into rock music and metal, I think my mum just thought it was just another thing I'd gotten myself into where there were no other black people...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":ty" class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and then you founded the West Indies National Team!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":tz" class="aOT"&gt;Ha, yeah she's a bit bemused by it all - she gave her Trinidad citizenship years ago. I think she's wondering why this outbreak of pride. It's been a way of connecting us with our heritage and our roots, it's been more emotional than I ever thought it would be.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aOT"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aOT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think it's partly a generational thing, reclaiming the roots of parents/grandparents.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aZe"&gt;
&lt;div class="aO1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aO2"&gt;Yep, definitely: we're different but the same.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=":u4" class="aOT"&gt;And for Mah-ko it's representing, and for [She-]RARR.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aOT"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="aOT"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
