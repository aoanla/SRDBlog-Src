&lt;p&gt;As we covered in our article on the South African roller derby community &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/06/rollerderby-za-2019/"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; , the population of South Africa is concentrated in a small number of widely-separated areas, so it's very expensive for the teams to play each other (let alone teams from other nations). As such, having this one big event at the end of the year is an achievable focus, and the community time it provides is all the valuable for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In last year's NDF, Johannesburg's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://goldencityrollers.com"&gt;Golden City Rollers&lt;/a&gt; , and Cape Town Rollergirls competed for the final rankings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Golden City Rollers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cape Town Rollergirls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The third team present, Durban Roller Derby, participated in the first two bouts, mixed teams games with skaters from all three teams.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt='The flyer image for this National Derby Fest: crouched jammer ready to sprint at start of whistle (in black and white, with red star), against horizontally divided yellow and red background box; yellow bar at top of flyer, red at bottom. Second box (positioned "on top" of the background, but "behind" the skater) reads "National Roller Derby Festival 2019". The logos of all three leagues with full teams are aligned along the bottom of the flyer.' src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/10/NDF2019.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/403124207306199/"&gt;National Derby Fest&lt;/a&gt; has a change of format, designed to maximise the amount of game play each team got. As such, this is National Derby Fest is a double round robin: each team will play the others &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt;, in half-length games (two 15 minute periods). As numbers for all teams are a little low this year, this will allow everyone to participate in as much derby as possible, whilst still playing WFTDA-rules otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth league in South Africa, Pretoria's P-Town Roller Derby, will be donating a skater to the Cape Town team, and we assume will be donating volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winners on points will go forward to play each other in a full-length WFTDA-regulation Final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golden City Rollers told us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
NDF is the highlight of the local derby calendar, so we're super excited to host it this year, and to see all our sister leagues again. Of course, the most important thing is to play some derby and enjoy every second, as we don't often get a chance to compete in SA. Secondly, it's an opportunity to introduce new spectators to the sport, so we're hoping it will help grow roller derby in SA.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Derby Fest 2019 will be hosted at: &lt;strong&gt;Uniao Portuguesa&lt;/strong&gt;, 4 Eastwood street, Turffontein, Johannesburg, South Africa, on &lt;strong&gt;9 November&lt;/strong&gt;, starting at 0930.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>golden city rollers</category><category>national derby fest</category><category>south african roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/nationalderbyfest-102019/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2019 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Skating at the tip of Africa: Roller Derby in South Africa</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/06/rollerderby-za-2019/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've written a bit about South African roller derby when covering their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/10/31/south-africas-national-derby-fest-2018-three-years-of-festivals/"&gt;national tournament&lt;/a&gt;, but there's a lot more to be said about the community than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geography informs the way in which Roller Derby develops in a country, and South Africa's is very different to what we're used to in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Map of South Africa's Population density, with leagues marked." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/06/southafrica-popdensity.png"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa is a large country - its area is about twice that of France - but with a relatively small population - about 80% that of France. And that population is very unevenly spread across the country: the dense province of &lt;strong&gt;Gauteng&lt;/strong&gt;, containing Johannesburg and Pretoria, contains about a &lt;em&gt;quarter&lt;/em&gt; of South Africa's entire population, with another fifth concentrated around Durban in the south-east province of &lt;strong&gt;KwaZulu-Natal&lt;/strong&gt;, and a further eighth around Cape Town in the &lt;strong&gt;Western Cape&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike in most European countries, then, the 4 leagues of South Africa - located in those 4 named cities - have difficulty even travelling to play each other on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add to this the fact that the only other country with Roller Derby in Africa is &lt;em&gt;Egypt&lt;/em&gt;, at the other end of the continent, and you can get a feel for how dedicated and unique the solutions adapted by the South African leagues have had to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we'll be discussing in some depth both those problems, and their solutions, so click on to read more:&lt;/p&gt;
