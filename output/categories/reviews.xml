The self-reporting on the website says that, at the time of publication, 376 leagues are currently using the service. At present, the service is available in both English and French, and has no user limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trackkarma (TK) is an app (well, a website that runs like an app) developed by Namur Roller Girls.&lt;br&gt;Their launching blurb is as follows….&lt;br&gt;“Ever dreamed of teams charters, training sessions, attendance, league agenda and directory all gathered in one single tool?&lt;br&gt;Here it is: TrackKarma, the application that will change the world (or at least your league).&lt;br&gt;In TrackKarma, members can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:list --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage their player profile and import a cute picture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check monthly agenda of games and training sessions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inform of their absence at practice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communicate with their bench crews&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visualize team charters and game rosters&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Register to coach at practice...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:list --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bench crews can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which sounds AMAZING, so Glasgow Men’s Roller Derby (GMRD) decided to give it a whirl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previously GMRD have tried alternatives to Facebook groups such as Slack, but we struggle to get everyone on board with using alternatives as although Facebook is handy for social media, it’s also the devil. [For a review of such options, we recommend &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@shredinger/software-tools-for-nonprofits-f2cc73deea49"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Ed]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have been trialling TrackKarma for about 3 months now and these are my thoughts:&lt;br&gt;I am a terrible technophobe, and I find TK very easy to use. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It makes sense and I don’t feel stupid using it (yey!). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is incredibly useful for keeping record of training sessions, games and attendance; however, like most ‘extra’ bits of work we ask skaters to do on top of training, some folk are using it really well, and others haven’t logged on at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Initially we asked everyone to be responsible for updating and maintaining their own attendance, but this was a bit optimistic on our part and so now we ask coaches to update skaters’ attendance after each session they coach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistically, this is, of course, not a problem, but the position is still counter-intuitive to some members of the community. Some blame the specific construction of the WFTDA rating system itself, whilst others simply believe that Tournaments should supersede mathematical methods for determining rating. &lt;br&gt;As a result, every year when the WFTDA Championship winner does not automatically become the WFTDA #1 rated team, the question of "how good are WFTDA Ratings?" is raised again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of this, we decided to actually test this, rather than just complaining about an aspect of the rating we didn't like. &lt;br&gt;Using Flat Track Stats' records of all Roller Derby bouts, we selected the entire history of all WFTDA Sanctioned bouts in the history of the sport, all the way back to 2005. Using these, we calculated what the ratings and rankings would look like now, if we used various methods for rating teams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Elo" ratings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, named for Arpad Elo, who developed them initially to rate performance of Chess players, are a particularly easy kind of rating to implement. As a base comparison to our other ratings, we wrote a very quick Elo rating for WFTDA Sanctioned bouts, based entirely on Win/Loss records: the rating does not care how much a team won or lost by, just that they &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We'll compare this to three other ratings:&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"&gt;FTS (WFTDA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: the Flat Track Stats rating, as optimised for WFTDA Sanctioned bouts. FTS is also an Elo rating, although its updates take into account the degree of success, not just that a team won; it also has a couple of other factors to account for things like home team advantage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRank.html"&gt;SRDRank (v2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRank.html"&gt;:&lt;/a&gt; this blog's in-house rating scheme. We've &lt;strong&gt;written&lt;/strong&gt; a lot about this before, but it's essentially an entirely different kind of rating scheme to Elo; rather than updating pairs of teams on each game, SRDRank is a &lt;em&gt;Massey-style&lt;/em&gt; scheme, which tries to produce consistent ratings to explain all of the games in its "purview" at once. This version of SRDRank was optimised for monthly predictions, against the world, not just the smaller subset of WFTDA Sanctioned games.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wftda.com/category/rankings/"&gt;WFTDA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: the official WFTDA rating and ranking, which is used to rank teams for selection into the official WFTDA tournaments. WFTDA ratings are specifically designed to be "easy for people to understand" without specialist knowledge, as well as, presumably, aiming to reflect the history of performance of their member leagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Predictive accuracy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key conflict between expectations of Rating systems and the reality, is often one between "prediction" and "postdiction".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Prediction&lt;/em&gt;" is, of course, using a rating to guess what a future result would be, by comparing the ratings of the competitors previously.&lt;br&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Postdiction&lt;/em&gt;", conversely, is using a rating to judge "how well" two teams have performed, over their recent history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst it may seem that the two are closely related, in fact, it isn't inherently true that a rating which has high accuracy at one is also highly accurate at the other. In general, prediction is harder than postdiction - it's always hard to guess what's going to happen beforehand - but for teams whose strength has varied a lot over their season, it also can be hard for a postdictive approach to represent their "overall performance" in a satisfying way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In neither case, of course, does "high accuracy" mean "always places the winner of a particular tournament at #1". All rating systems are statistical, and try to produce the best overall measure of performance, for all teams, and all possible contests. The difference between the top teams is just as relevant as those between the middle and lowest rated teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally important to the accuracy of a rating - at either task - is the frequency at which it is updated. Elo ratings, including the FTS ratings, are designed to update every time a game happens, so their accuracy can be measured either side of a given result. Some other ratings are published less frequently - WFTDA's ratings are monthly to bimonthly, depending on the time of year, and SRDRank is &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; to produce predictions no faster than daily. Frequent ratings aren't necessarily the "best" ratings, especially for postdiction - a "long-term overview" can sometimes produce a better overall view of historical performance than a rapidly updated one focused on bout-by-bout changes; but for prediction, especially in the middle of tournaments, it's usually best to have all the most recent information available for your next bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this, we've plotted the performance of four different ratings, at both postdiction and prediction, when we take updates at yearly, quarterly, monthly, fortnightly, and "bout-by-bout" intervals. For some rating schemes, not all intervals were available: FTS doesn't easily provide "historical rating" collections for anything more frequent than quarterly results. (We have a single data point for the FTS "bout-by-bout" period, for prediction, thanks to Ioan Wigmore.); WFTDA ratings are not updated faster than monthly at best; SRDRank doesn't produce "bout-by-bout" updates for this kind of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all cases, the postdiction accuracies (as percentage "correct") are shown by triangles, and the prediction accuracies by circles; the same colour is used for a given rating scheme. More "rapid" updates are to the left of the graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:image {"id":27847} --&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/12/screen-shot-2018-12-10-at-22-28-40.png" alt="" class="wp-image-27847"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Success rates for prediction (calling games ahead of time) and postdiction (representing performance after the fact) for 4 rating systems, with different time bases.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that should be clear is that postdiction is, in general, easier than prediction: &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; rating has a higher postdiction accuracy than prediction accuracy, for every update period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Elo rating has some of the highest postdiction accuracies, partly because it responds "fully" to every win or loss: a win counts 100%, even if it was a narrow victory, so each result pulls the rating around strongly, making it reflect history. This tendency to be "recency-biased" also explains why its postdiction gets "better" on shorter updates: a "weekly" postdiction only has to represent the last week of play accurately, and that's what Elo is best at. When we need the Elo rating to represent an entire year of performance, its bias towards the most recent month harms it overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same effect, also means that the Elo rating is also the worst at prediction: because it counts all wins equally, a single narrow upset can throw off any trend it was measuring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SRDRank and FTS are closely matched for the update periods where they can be compared, with SRDRank having a slight advantage in prediction, and a noticeable one in postdiction; by comparison, the WFTDA rating is worse than all other ratings at postdiction, except on the yearly scale, and only better than the Elo rating at prediction. SRDRank is particularly good at "yearly review" postdiction: representing the entire year's performance overall; this is because of design decisions which mean that it considers an 18 month period of games in order to make its rating evaluation. The same "long term" view means that its postdictions are worse at reflecting "short term" history than the recency-focused Elo, although it still out-performs every other metric at this task.&lt;br&gt;The WFTDA rating, meanwhile, is hampered by having a maximum amount it can respond to any "strength change", meaning that it struggles to keep up with the more performant ratings on postdiction; and its simple rating calculation is not sophisticated enough to predict well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For prediction, the "sports prediction" literature generally considers accuracies above about &lt;strong&gt;70%&lt;/strong&gt; to be excellent. On that measure, only two ratings are excellent for Roller Derby prediction: SRDRank (fortnightly or weekly updates), and FTS ("bout by bout", although it is likely that it would also be excellent on the same timescales SRDRank is). It is likely that better than 75% or so win/loss prediction accuracy is impossible for Roller Derby: there are always closely-matched games which "could go either way", which even an accurate algorithm will guess wrongly about half the time by definition.&lt;br&gt;We should also say that, by this measure, the WFTDA rating isn't that bad at all, only just missing out on that 70% benchmark, although it's not in the same class as the other two schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For postdiction, there are less expectations on excellence, as the difficulty is partly dependant on how "variable" the sport is. The ~85% accuracy attained by Elo (quarterly or shorter) and SRDRank (yearly) is exceptional, however. The WFTDA rating actually does fairly well at "yearly" postdiction - summarising the years' performance in a single measure - but it is worse than every other metric when applied on a more frequent basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Predictive Accuracy (with close misses)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above, simply judging a rating on its ability to call wins and losses causes problems when evaluating close games. A good rating will predict that a close bout will be close; but inevitably, random chance will cause it to be wrong about which one of the contestants will actually win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways in which we can correct for this issue: we can move to measuring the success at predicting actual score-lines (not just winners and losers), but this is hard to compare for our metrics (mainly as the Elo rating isn't designed to predict score-lines); or, we can give credit to the rating for results it gets wrong&lt;em&gt; if the game was close, and the rating predicted it to be close.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[As an aside: SRDRank was actually optimised against the first metric: getting score-lines as close as possible, for the entire world's history of games.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of how this changes our evaluation of ratings, we've graphed the accuracies of the Elo and SRDRank ratings again, for both pre- and post-diction. This time, we've included a second set of points for each: the success measured, including games which the rating called the winner wrong, but correctly predicted the result to be close either way (within 10% on the scoreline).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:image {"id":27850} --&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/12/screen-shot-2018-12-11-at-13-14-51.png?w=700" alt="" class="wp-image-27850"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Success rates for prediction and postdiction for 2 rating systems, including successes on calling close games as close (regardless of who won).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, including "close games" results in a significant boost to our evaluation of all the metrics, although it does not "reverse the order" of any of our ratings in terms of relative performance. (Notably, SRDRank's yearly postdiction now narrowly beats all comers when you include close games, even defeating Elo's best postdiction with close games.)&lt;br&gt;Although we did not include them on the graph (in order to make the graph still somewhat readable), we'd expect similar gains for the FTS and WFTDA ratings; an average of around 2% additional "successes" for each test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Best Rating for a Job&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the metrics above, we can attempt to select the "best" ratings to use for a particular task. We've selected four representative tasks, and mapped them to the mode (pre- and post-diction) and "timescales" on which they operate, to select recommendations, and warnings, on the approaches you should consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Season Review&lt;/strong&gt; is the task of summarising, as best you can, the overall performance of the field over the past season. This is a postdiction task, on a long timescale (six months to a year). This is also a very closely contested task, and there's not much to call between all 4 ratings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medium-term Prediction&lt;/strong&gt; is the task of predicting results several weeks to months in advance, to plan tournaments and games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play-by-Play Prediction&lt;/strong&gt; is the task of predicting results on the minute, judging your next game at a tournament, for example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medium-term Review&lt;/strong&gt; is the task of summarising, the overall performance of the field, on the scale of months. This is the "coaching" metric, when judging how well your team is evolving. For this, second place is very tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also (bearing in mind the relative expectations of accuracy, as discussed in the rest of this article), generate the full "rankings" for all of the WFTDA member leagues for 2018. (The WFTDA Ranking here is the one from 30 Nov 2018, the most recently available ranking and rating from WFTDA).&lt;br&gt;We present here the top 20, with ratings, from each scheme - notice that, despite the differences, there are far more similarities than disagreements.&lt;br&gt;(Ratings are &lt;em&gt;truncated&lt;/em&gt; for space: the error introduced by truncation rather than rounding is much smaller than the expected error on the ratings themselves, so this is not an issue.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;All WFTDA Leagues (graph, image)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we've previously discussed, however, strict rankings are a bad way to represent the performance of teams. It's much better, even with 1-dimensional ratings, to report those ratings, providing a better measure of the "distance" between teams, than to imply that all teams are equally "1 better" than the team immediately "below" them in ranking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, we've generated a graph of all the teams rated by at least one of our ratings in their yearly review. We order the teams in "WFTDA ranking" order, with teams not in the official WFTDA ranking placed at the end. &lt;br&gt;In order to provide a good comparison, we've rescaled all the ratings to represent logarithmic relative strength, compared to the "top" team in the rating*. (That is: for every "1" difference in rating, the better team is expected to score about 2.7× as much in a game; for every "2" difference, 2.7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;× (7.4×), for every "3" difference, 2.7&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;× (20×) and so on.)&lt;br&gt;This image is unavoidably large in order to be legible; click the preview to get the full-size version.&lt;br&gt;Note that the full range of the entire rated cohort for all ratings is about &lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;, corresponding to the top 3 teams being expected to score around &lt;strong&gt;3000×&lt;/strong&gt; more points than the bottom 3 (or, effectively, a complete shutout).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:image {"id":27849} --&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/12/rating-performance-sheet3-crp.gif?w=700" alt="" class="wp-image-27849"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;All WFTDA Member Leagues, displayed in WFTDA 30 Nov 2018 order (with extras not in that rating appended after), with all their ratings. (Ratings scaled to the same type for direct comparison.)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that, in general, there's still a reasonable agreement on the overall "shape" of the rating; the ratings all broadly agree on the strength difference between the top and bottom ends of the list, and whilst there are disagreements in order, there's also a lot of agreement about the overall place of most teams.&lt;br&gt;It's also possible to see how the "difference in skill between ranks" changes: the steeper the slope of the curve, the more change there is in relative skill as you change ranking. For WFTDA Member leagues, there seems to be a relatively flat middle section, where adjacent teams are actually very close in strength; at the top end, there's a much steeper rating change with rank, until the curve flattens again around the top 3 or 4. (All the ratings pretty much agree that Victoria and Rose are near-tied in the top 2, they just disagree about which is a tiny sliver ahead.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've given an overview and test of the official WFTDA rating scheme, versus 3 contenders for a range of use cases.&lt;br&gt;Contrary to some complaints, the WFTDA rating scheme turns out to be a pretty good rating, for post-diction, on the longer timescales. &lt;br&gt;More sophisticated schemes do better than it at almost all tests, but its performance, given its simplicity and the trade-offs it makes to try to prevent high-skill teams playing low-skilled teams for blowouts all the time, is acceptable.&lt;br&gt;Also, this test run underlines just how hard it is to make gains in predicting (or postdicting) game results: the gap between the worst and best performing metrics in this test is never more than 10%, and the gap between the "good" ratings tends to be around the 1% level. &lt;br&gt;We do note that, for prediction, Flat Track Stats attains class-leading performance, especially on short time scales. (It is just as good when rating European teams, MRDA teams, or any other region where it has an actively calculated rating.) We'd encourage regions which do not have their own rating scheme to contact Flat Track Stats to host such a thing for them. (The other benefit to this is that you have a place to store all your results: Flat Track Stats is also a public repository of all the game data which is uploaded to it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator"&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*WFTDA estimated strength differences are calculated using the predicted strength ratios in the WFTDA algorithm, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the predicted "points gained". Other calculators use the points-gained formula, as they're interested in seeing how the rating &lt;em&gt;changes with results&lt;/em&gt;: we're interested in how strong WFTDA's rating &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; thinks teams are, which is different. (The fact that these &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; different for WFTDA is why sufficiently strong teams can't play weak teams without losing overall rating: points gains doesn't keep pace with strength difference. None of the other rating schemes in this article have this behaviour.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst there are actually a lot of resources out in the wild concerning various aspects of roller derby, they're often fairly disorganised and dispersed, or strewn across various Facebook and other social media groups which aren't necessarily the easiest to find. (The original roller derby leagues in the UK created a newsgroup for this, which eventually evolved into UKRDA, but things have moved on since then.) Additionally, there's a big problem with link-rot and social media decay in modern resources, which can easily lead to a given source of information vanishing, becoming stale, or otherwise more useless over time. (We wrote a little about this issue &lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/09/the-vanishing-history-of-roller-derby/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;earlier this year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-26888 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/06/derbydirectory.jpg" alt="DerbyDirectory" width="426" height="426"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://derbydirectory.info/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derby Directory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aims to solve all of this, at least in the UK; although its resources are mostly useful regardless of where your league is based. The brainchild of two of Border City Roller Derby, Carlisle's members - coach, referee, and founder Schrödinger's Phat #1691, and coach and skater Hoolia #2122 - this website aims to collect together, and organise, all the information you need to start up a league, or start off as a newbie skater. As Border City has only very recently transitioned to the state of being a "bouting" league, the issues of beginning skaters, and beginning leagues, are very fresh in the minds of all involved.&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps as a result, the site's organisation is really very good, with categories from the Rookie Corner (a step-by-step guide to the frequently asked questions of people new to derby), and Kit (including an itemised list of the mandatory kit items, with suggested products, ordered by price), through a comprehensive guide to Skate Care, links to Bootcamps and Coaches who are available to run sessions, and even a guide on Starting a New League.
In all cases, the clean, simple style, and clearly defined categories help to get to the information you need, quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all projects like this, the proof of the pudding will be in the longer term - but both of the founders seem committed to maintaining and updating the site - both expanding it, and fighting the entropic forces of link rot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're also still collecting offers of additional information - and especially Coaches available to run sessions for their mini-classified section there. If you're a Coach whose time is available for other teams, do let the Derby Directory team know!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>coaching</category><category>communication</category><category>derby directory</category><category>in the news</category><category>reviews</category><category>training</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/06/21/derby-directory-a-new-uk-focused-resource-for-growing-the-sport/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jun 2018 10:15:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Roller Derby and Open, Consensus Software</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that "What do you use to manage your league?" is one of the most repeated questions in Roller Derby circles. (We've seen at least three versions of this topic raised in the last couple of months...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, one of the most common answers is: "we use Facebook because getting people to use something else is really hard".
This is true, of course: Facebook's entire raison d'etre is selling access to its community to advertisers, so it's extremely good at finding ways to stop that community leaving it. The problem is that Facebook is also fairly terrible at being a system for managing a league - finding things which didn't happen in the last few days is very hard, and there's few good tools for decision making or project planning.  Additionally, Facebook's policy decisions, in general, are at the whims of their management; the history of Facebook's changes to its social content to improve the advertising revenue, at the cost of service to the user community, is telling.
Facebook Events &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a pretty good solution for promoting public events - and they're &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than the features in most other social networking sites - but only if your target audience is also on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's the other part of the rub: despite Facebook's best efforts, not everyone has an account on it. Increasingly, especially younger, people - the people your league wants to recruit to grow - are either using other social networks (Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat), or not using social networks at all (just communication tools like WhatsApp). All social networking services "age out" after a while, and becoming dependant on a particular social network for running your league gives you a built-in sell-by date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we've previously noted, there's a lot of ethical and philosophical overlap between Roller Derby culture - "For the X, by the X", regardless of if "X" is "Skater", "Member", or otherwise - and the various open culture and consensus democracy movements on the Internet. Luckily, those movements also have built a lot of software for helping organise the various issues communities face...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to break down the (software) problems of managing a league (or an NGB, which is really a community of leagues) into a few sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/2/"&gt;Project Management&lt;/a&gt; (page 2) - the core aspect of running any community with goals - managing who is responsible for them, and how things are going.
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/3/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consensus decision making&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (page 3)  - making decisions that your community can own.
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/4/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-time &lt;em&gt;Communication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (page 4) - bringing your community into contact with each other, transparently, in discussion.
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/5/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event &lt;em&gt;Calendaring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (page 5) - keeping track of time, especially to promote your events to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not going to talk about "sports club" specific software here, although it does exist. Mostly those tools cover the items on page 2 - Project Management - with a sports-themed emphasis.
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Community Task Management : Taiga, Podio&lt;/h3&gt;
The most important thing that a community with tasks to accomplish needs is a way to track and manage all the responsibilities for making those tasks happen. This is such a common requirement for any community - be it a sporting group, a software development team, a newspaper or a political party, a FTSE100 company... - that there are countless solutions which address this space. Some of these solutions are tied to particular "styles" of project management, and some are more free-form.
&lt;p&gt;As with all of the other solutions in this article, we're going to talk about "hosted" solutions - software which runs on someone else's servers, where they're responsible for all the data you give them - and "self-hosted" solutions - where you run your own service, on servers which you own [this can be actual physical machines, or services in "the cloud"], where you have more control, but also need more technically skilled people to run things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, one of the most popular hosted solutions for project management is &lt;a href="https://podio.com/site/en"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Podio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
As well as project management, Podio tries to be a kitchen-sink solution - also rolling in forums, voting systems and document management - and offers a free trial option (for small teams &amp;lt; 5 members), and a series of paid options (paid per member). We've not used Podio much in anger, but, as with many project management tools with "extras", it seems that the core project management is much better than the things bolted on to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very many free, or open-source solutions in this space as well - open-source communities also need to manage their own tasks, and tend to write their own tools to do so! Out of these options, we currently favour &lt;a href="https://taiga.io/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Taiga is more focussed on the task-management aspect of things (although it does do many of the things Podio offers in addition), and prefers solutions in the "agile development" space, which encourages breaking projects up into rapid, incremental goals to allow a team to adapt to changing circumstances. Taiga offers both hosted solutions (free for public projects, paid per member for private projects), and also supports self-hosting - the source code is completely free, so anyone can run their own Taiga server.
The Taiga team also have a handy guide to project management, and Taiga, here: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://taiga.pm/"&gt;https://taiga.pm/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiga and Podio both offer mobile-phone Apps for phone-friendly access, as well as the desktop friendly web interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other good solutions, depending on the Project Management paradigm you like, include Trello and Wrike (both hosted services), and Orchard Collaboration (an open-source, self-hosted solution). There are also several app-only services aimed specifically at running sports clubs, but these seem to be vexingly limited and are usually pay-only. One of the best of the sports club solutions seems to be &lt;a href="https://teamstuff.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TeamStuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which, despite being a hosted closed-source solution, does have a free option with most of the features you'd want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Community Consensus : Loomio&lt;/h3&gt;
In order to drive your community's priorities, you need to make decisions which involve your whole community. Hierarchical cultures will make decisions from "on top", whilst more open, "democratic", communities will involve the membership in all decisions, from "bottom up".  The project management software from the previous page will often allow for both styles, but tend to focus on adversarial voting systems to do "democracy".
&lt;p&gt;Generally,  the best approaches to community decision making tend to be Consensus, not direct voting; approaches whereby the community &lt;em&gt;negotiates&lt;/em&gt; a mutually acceptable solution for any given problem, collaboratively, rather than adversarially.
Consensus approaches for government are pretty widespread in many cultures in the world, from the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) through to the Religious Society of Friends (the Quakers). They've not caught on as much in Western-style mainstream politics, where adversarial voting systems are more common, and the "minority loses absolutely" mindset can be difficult to shake, even when relatively minor compromises could improve solutions for everyone. Majority votes easily split communities, and can be a big source of frustrations and feelings of disenfranchisement for those in the minority (especially if that minority is large, or if the "majority" is less than 50% itself)*.
We know that many leagues adopt consensus style systems to make decisions - but many also don't, and it's definitely worth considering them if your league uses adversarial voting and has strong tensions due to minority votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use software to help you make decisions by consensus, then you will probably need to use a separate service to your project management solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best Consensus decision-making application we're aware of is &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loomio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
A product of the Occupy movement, and run by a self-owned community, Loomio provides both a hosted option (you can sign up for accounts on the Loomio website and use it right away, with free and paid options - including a very discounted paid option for non-profits), and also options for hosting your own copy on your own servers (the code is, of course, entirely open-source, and therefore compatible with the community spirit of roller derby). Loomio has become increasingly widely-used by communities at all scale, even national governments - the &lt;a href="http://blog.loomio.org/2016/05/16/national_assembly_wales/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welsh Assembly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loomio also provides mobile-phone friendly interfaces to allow you to interact easily on whatever device you have, although there's no "App" per se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You can read about how the Loomio Collective embodies the same spirit as Roller Derby does, and the way they structure themselves to support this in their freely available handbook: &lt;a href="https://loomio.coop/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://loomio.coop/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , and read their free, and open-source guide to Consensus and Facilitation here: &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.school/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://www.loomio.school/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*This is as true in countries as it is in smaller communities - we're sure readers can point at several contentious political decisions in the recent past where "narrow victories" led to the absolute acceptance of the "winning" position with no compromise, and resulting anger from all sides.
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Community Communication : Mattermost, Riot.IM&lt;/h3&gt;
Every community benefits from a place to just, well, communicate. Whilst Loomio, and project management tools, all provide a way to discuss things, modern communities are used to freeform, rapid, social messaging. (Ironically, this also used to be the case with earlier internet cultures, who used IRC for precisely this, so this is something of a re-invention of an old concept.) Having one of these communication services absolutely is not a replacement for a proper decision making system, or a project management tool - for the same reason that Facebook is awful for project management: finding things in a long, stream of consciousness history, 6 months later, is almost impossible. However, rapid communication is definitely essential "in the moment", and to bind together your other services with your community itself.
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the current "mainstream" solution for real-time comms seems to be &lt;strong&gt;Slack&lt;/strong&gt;, that product has several limitations which make it less than ideal for large volunteer communities. For a start, Slack is closed-source; and there's no way to run your own separate version of the service - all your data is on Slack's servers, and subject to Slack's rules.
Additionally, the balance of features between the Free and Paid tiers of service is not particularly good, especially regarding retention of logs - it's very easy to hit the "max 10,000" messages limit and then start losing your league's history of communication.
Finally, because of that very closed-source, hosted-only solution, Slack has the balance of power in your relationship with it - very recently, they've started&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://opkode.com/blog/slacks-bait-and-switch/"&gt;turning off features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which allow you more flexibility in using their service, as part of the usual pattern to achieve vendor lock-in in the tech industry. Having to rely on your service being a good-guy, all the time, is not a good place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the open-source movement has our backs, and there are many alternatives to Slack which are just as good, if not better, ethically and performance-wise. We will only mention two here, as examples of the rest of the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.mattermost.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mattermost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provide a Slack-like series of options (free, paid, and "even more expensive paid"), but you need to &lt;em&gt;host&lt;/em&gt; your own server running the software. Of course, the free version of Mattermost is open-source, and does not have most of the limits of the free version of Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.riot.im/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riot.IM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provide a hosted solution which is currently totally free for every feature (they are planning paid hosted options, but it's been a year without any appearing); they're also a completely open-source solution which you can host yourself. [Technically, Riot.IM is a front-end to a messaging system called Matrix, which is also open-source and free.] At present, the "free" Riot.IM hosted instance seems to be having some performance problems, but we believe that this is temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-26484" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-07-at-22-22-36.png?w=1024" alt="Riot.IM" width="1024" height="1009"&gt; A test room in Riot.IM (all of these chat systems look near identical, and much like chat systems always have done since the 1990s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Mattermost and Riot.IM support Slack-compatible "integrations" - allowing your Loomio consensus discussions, and your project management tool, to send notifications and messages to your chat rooms, reminding your community of decisions to be made, or tasks which need to be performed. (The Loomio integration even lets you respond directly from the notification!) With both sets of integrations turned on, your chat channel can be the social "glue" which binds your decision making and your project management together.
Mattermost and Riot.IM also both offer mobile Apps for phone-friendly access, which are just as good as Slack's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Mattermost and Riot.IM (and other alternatives like RocketChat etc) are both open-source, and provide self-hosting solutions, they are very unlikely to try (or succeed at) the same vendor-lock-in approaches which Slack is currently attempting. We'd strongly recommend that leagues look at any of the Slack alternatives with open-source options just for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/5/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event &lt;em&gt;Calendaring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (page 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Community Event Calendaring: Google Calendar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final thing that any league needs is a way to keep track of events, and to promote the public ones to the world. This is really two problems: a calendar, and "social media suite".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, promoting public events is something that Facebook itself is actually fairly good at, as we mentioned at the start of the article - as long as your community is all on the platform (which they increasingly are not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more open-access calendaring and event promotion, there are relatively few truly "open" services. The problem with "promotion" is, of course, that you do need an audience and a way to push your things at them. In the past, this was handled by common services - like RSS - which could be "subscribed" to by interested people, who would then get updates. In the present, your calendaring service needs to be able to be promoted on all your social media platforms, which (given the increasing fragmentation of the market) is much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One &lt;em&gt;hosted&lt;/em&gt; service which does work pretty well for this - and has less lock-in than Facebook - is &lt;a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Obviously, Google is not the most "grass-roots" of providers - and they have a disappointing track record in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Discontinued_Google_services"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;turning off services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at little notice. However, their Calendaring service is one of the more used of their core products, so it's a slightly safer bet for longevity than some of their other products. Google Calendar is also used as the "backend" for many other applications which manage schedules and events for users.
In itself, Google Calendar handles the calendar part of things pretty well, and for free (Google, like Facebook, get money from having data about you, and pushing ads at you). A Google Calendar event is inherently public, and can be linked to by you from anywhere, without the viewers needing a login.
&lt;a href="https://zapier.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zapier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IFTTT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the two most popular "app automation services", fully support the "social media" side of things - they can be set up to automatically share a public calendar event on any and all social media platforms you have logins for. (They also have integrations for Mattermost to post things in your public chat, and several of the Project Management applications - like Trello and Wrike - can add things to a Google Calendar for you automatically.))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the other side of things, there are a whole suite of applications to share things across social media with the click of a button, most of which are paid, hosted services - ranging from the relatively affordable (Loomly, Hootsuite, etc), to the ridiculously expensive and "professional" (Kapost, Percolate and others). The more expensive of these offer huge ranges of services to schedule promotional posts across whole suites of social media profiles and platforms... your league probably already has their social media team using whatever their favourite tool is (and it's probably Hootsuite). Most of these can integrate with a lot of the tools from earlier sections (including your communication service), and can draw items from Google Calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the technically minded people in your league, we'd actually recommend &lt;strong&gt;hosting your calendar yourselves&lt;/strong&gt; on your website, and linking people there across all your social media accounts. (You can make Facebook Events and Google Calendar entries to match it, of course, but owning your data on your website gives you more control and freedom).  If you do this, please do turn on the RSS (or Atom) feed, as it's a very cheap and open way to provide updates to your schedule for anyone who wants to subscribe.* This also frees you from needing to rely on third-party services like Zapier, as you can push your social media notifications directly from your server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Our weekly event roundups for the world mostly draw from Facebook Events as a pragmatic acceptance that that's where leagues advertise things [and we prefer that to the growing trend of leagues just posting an flyer on Instagram, which doesn't help syndication at all].... but being able to subscribe to RSS feeds would also make our lives easier ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;BONUS: Community Forums: Discourse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we've covered the most popular modern means of communication in the &lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/4/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-time &lt;em&gt;Communication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; section, some leagues may also want to host a more static discussion.
Whilst project management software, and Loomio, provide discussion threads as part of their service, there can be some benefits to running a separate Forum, in addition to your real-time discussion rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, you will want to self-host your own forum software, as the hosted services are not that great. There is a wide range of, mostly open-source, forum software to choose from, and our recommendation here does not mean you shouldn't go for one of the alternatives.
However, since we have to recommend at least one solution for each topic, we will be suggesting &lt;a href="https://www.discourse.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discourse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Discourse is, unlike most of the other forum software, written in Ruby, and has a very responsive Javascript powered interface. Whilst overuse of Javascript in webpages is definitely a security issue in itself, Discourse benefits significantly in usability compared to older forum software which has a less responsive design.
Discourse also offer a hosted solution, although it's rather expensive ($100 a month!). We'd definitely recommend using their container-based self-hosting solution in preference to this, just for the cost-saving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In common with the software in many of the other section, Discourse also provides a number of "integrations" with other services - a chat integration so your real-time chat can be notified of new topics, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

Keen to see exactly what the guys could offer, I snapped up a ticket as soon as they went on sale, and I'm fairly certain that I wasn't only person who was excited to see exactly what was on offer as there was a tremendous turn out.
Unless you have been living under a derby-proof rock, you will be very aware of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/02/15/power-of-scotland-fundraising-for-calgary/"&gt;amazing efforts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from the whole squad to ensure they arrive in Calgary ready to take on the other participating nations. They've raised money any way they could, from bungee jumping, beard shaving, scrimmage, coaching and selling merchandise at games across the country and now bootcamping (it's a word now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460057323219.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="wp-1460057323219" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460057323219.jpg" alt="image" width="1200" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Photo: &lt;a href="http://lauramacd.co.uk/roller-derby-photography/"&gt;Laura MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I am so excited by this bootcamp and possibly why I was asked to write this was my enthusiasm for the fantastic planning and flow of the whole day. These guys didn't throw this together overnight. They even had print-outs! I mean who doesn't love a bit of literature to look back on?! The whole squad pulled together and they really delivered.
The first part of the day was led by the wonderful Nuke. Now, Nuke is a lovely bloke and a fabulous skater to watch and I was very keen on learning from him. Leading the day with agility and footwork he put us through our paces and he stripped everything back to basics - I learned loads. I've skated since 2011/2012 and I had no idea that since mins I had forgotten how to step without my wheels rolling (Don't make me do mins again). The highlight, however, may have been Nuke's tartan leggings &amp;lt;3
Next up we had the lovely Blockbeard with his jamming skills session. Despite the name, everything he went through was very easily transferable to blockers. He broke the session down into evasive, attack and “Blammer” techniques - he really didn't hold back. His session led on from Nuke's agility session perfectly by incorporating the control and agility we had just learned. With an added technique on moving blocker twice your size with just a wee nudge. Thanks Pal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two solid hours of skating and it was time for lunch and an audience with Optimus Grime, Power of Scotlands very own Viking looking, hard hitting, softy. Those who know Grime, know that he has a background in bodybuilding. Who better to take us through a strength and conditioning seminar with bonus print-outs (I think he has surplus and may as well share). Highlighting some of the confusing things about weight training for performance and making it so easily understood was an incredible addition to the bootcamp. I already mentioned how much I loved the format and this for me was a very welcome aspect to incorporate in. Most people think that just skating will get you where you need to be, but Grime makes sure you know exactly how a little weight training will help improve your game even further, also talking a little about nutrition and the right things to eat pre and post-game/training. The chair demonstrations were also absolutely fabulous. [Editor's note: Optimus Grime's accompanying Mental Strength presentation was cut from the bootcamp due to time, but we have managed to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/04/07/guest-post-mental-strength-with-power-of-scotlands-optimus-grime/"&gt;publish a copy here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo: &lt;a href="http://lauramacd.co.uk/roller-derby-photography/"&gt;Laura MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuelled up and ready to get back on skates our final session before the mixed scrim was led by Skate Plisken. This session was on effective offence. Plisken took us through a few offence techniques that we have all seen performed by the POS guys recently at scrims and they were most definitely effective. Including the beautifully named “Sausage” technique; I sincerely hope no sausages were offended ( HA!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day wasn't quite over yet; there was still a scrimmage to be had. We had 1 hour to test out everything we had learned over the course of the day with 2 members of POS being gifted to either side as Bench and LUM. Prior to the scrim Nuke and Plisken, who were LUM and Bench for Team White, sat us down and went over basic Scrim strategy. This was excellent; not only were newer skaters getting the chance to scrim but there was also time to talk about strategy, which we all know doesn't come easily. I'm not sure I can express my love for this bootcamp any more than I already have without sounding like a raving loon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout every session the boys were on hand to observe, advise and sometimes join in. The day was full of laughs and smiles but no one was holding back. Those who attended skated hard and gave it everything they could. Absorbing all of this information, everyone was eager to take it back to their home leagues and try it out - myself included. I had such a huge buzz from whole day and have been internalising everything I learned since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460057355236.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="wp-1460057355236" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460057355236.jpg" alt="image" width="1200" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Righteous Oxide drills the referees in their parallel bootcamp. (Photo: &lt;a href="http://lauramacd.co.uk/roller-derby-photography/"&gt;Laura MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was a whole separate side to the bootcamp that I cannot forget to mention, even though I wasn't a part of this side of things I know just how valuable it is to the derby community.
Up in the balcony of the hall there were both a Ref and NSO school going on. Led by Righteous Oxide (Dundee Roller Girls) and Fairy Nuff (Auld Reekie Roller Girls) the Refs were in excellent hands to advance through their Refereeing career, with sessions on positions, communication, and Head Referee responsibilities. It must have been amazing because they did a brilliant job during the scrim.
The NSO section was Hosted by Alix ( Dundee Roller Girls) and Peggy Krueger ( Auld Reekie Roller Girls) with sessions on NSO positions, communication, people management and Head NSO responsibilities. From what I hear it was amazing and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it.
It is absolutely imperative to the sport that we have Refs and officials available and the fact that POS were able to accommodate absolutely everyone was truly amazing. Skill levels did not matter to these lads, everyone had a place and they made it a complete success. I think I can speak for everyone when I say thank-you, POS for hosting such a fabulous bootcamp, for sharing your knowledge, kindness and to wish you all the best of Luck in Calgary.&lt;/p&gt;

Her aim was to produce a new introductory book on the sport, showing a prospective new member of the derby community everything they needed to know to understand the culture and demands of Derby, and enthusing them about the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released to backers on the 17th June 2015, and preorderable from &lt;a href="http://www.gutpunchpress.com"&gt;Gutpunch Press&lt;/a&gt; for nonbackers, &lt;em&gt;Derby Life: A Crash Course in the Incredible Sport of Roller Derby&lt;/em&gt; is the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, as a "Book for prospective new skaters", comparisons with 2011's &lt;em&gt;Down and Derby&lt;/em&gt; will come up. And, yes, both books have a somewhat similar overarching structure - &lt;em&gt;Down and Derby&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Derby Life&lt;/em&gt; both start with a chapter on the history of the sport, going back to the original Walkathons in 1920s New York, and sections following on various aspects of derby culture (what kit you need, what the rules are, "Derby attitude"...).
Of course, a lot has changed in roller derby culture over the last 4 years, and this is really key to the differences between the works - while &lt;em&gt;Down and Derby&lt;/em&gt; projects the more actively Riot Grrl tone still around in 2011, and is innocently Americentric in its treatment of the sport, &lt;em&gt;Derby Life&lt;/em&gt; is happier to emphasise the actual sporting and athletic aspects of the game, and tries to be less parochial in its conversation. For the most part, this is an improvement on the former book, although I did sometimes miss the punchier tone that the younger sport evoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are flaws in &lt;em&gt;Derby Life&lt;/em&gt; as a book, they also stem from its determination to be even handed - a decision to try to make the book independent of any particular ruleset means that the rules discussion becomes a little too generic for my taste (and, yet, still mentions that the purpose of pivots is to take star passes, even though that isn't true in several of the rulesets that Em Dash mentions in the same chapter). The same problem occurs in the tactics/strategy section, presumably in an attempt to keep the text relevant in the face of a rapidly changing metagame. In general, I found that the best chapters were those which tried to actually give more detailed advice to the prospective skater: the gear, training and health/psychology sections were all very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this said, most of the Kickstarter backers are not the target audience of &lt;em&gt;Derby Life&lt;/em&gt;. We are generally existing members of the derby community, and so introductory advice, as comprehensive as Em Dash makes it, is always going to feel a little lacking. For us, the crowning glory of &lt;em&gt;Derby Life&lt;/em&gt; is right at the end: the collected selection of derby anecdotes, advice and expressive writing from individual skaters across the world. While they are extremely varied in length, style and content, each of them is a heartfelt gem, and as effective advocate for roller derby as the other 80% of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judged as a modern, comprehensive introductory guide to participation in Roller Derby as a sport, &lt;em&gt;Derby Life&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent work, and you should feel no hesitation in getting a copy for any prospective skaters you know, especially if you were already thinking of buying them &lt;em&gt;Down and Derby&lt;/em&gt;. More established members of the community, however, will still want to pick up a copy just for the collected Derby Stories section at the tail end of the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>books</category><category>derby life</category><category>in the news</category><category>reviews</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/06/22/book-review-derby-life-by-em-dash/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2015 09:37:26 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
