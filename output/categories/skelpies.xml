&lt;p&gt;Derby in 2018 has well and truly started after the Christmas break as we have just witnessed the Womens World cup in Manchester recently and still have the Men's world cup to look forward to in April. But this month sees the return of derby in Scotland, with the first games of 2018 taking place thanks to Bairn City Rollers. As they will be kicking of their 2018 by hosting a double header in Grangemouth Sports Complex on Saturday the 24th of February.&lt;/p&gt;

Doors open at 14:45 for this Round 2 double header that will see &lt;span class="_4n-j _3cht fsl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/tsinvaders/"&gt;Teesside Skate Invaders&lt;/a&gt; v &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BehavingDerby/"&gt;Men Behaving Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Game 1 and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers/"&gt;Bairn City Rollers' Skelpies&lt;/a&gt; v &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/GlasgowMensRollerDerby/"&gt;Glasgow Men's Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; in Game 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first round of the tier took place in Dublin during the Easter weekend and saw GMRD take a win over Teeside 234 to 167, whilst a depleted Skelpies team were beaten by Men Behaving Derby 235 to 131.  Those results left GMRD and Men Behaving derby Joint top on points, but Men Behaving Derby top thanks to score difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
Unfortunately for BCR's Skelpies, they have picked up a few more injuries at their first game. This has left them with an even smaller roster than they had in Dublin; due to this they have decided to forfeit their game with GMRD, awarding GMRD the win.
&lt;p&gt;However, BCR will be drafting in a few guests to fill in the gaps in their squad thus allowing a game to be played and the event to remain a double header. The game will not count towards Champs, of course, but will still be great derby!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teeside vs Men Behaving Derby will be a great fight. Teeside will be looking to to get their first points on the board, whilst Men Behaving Derby will be looking to take another win to consolidate their place at the top of the table.&lt;/p&gt;

Now as they approach their 4th birthday they are kicking of celebrations and ending their 2016 season in the best way they could, a co-ed game. Their opponents will be the Brawler Buddies, who are made up of skaters from &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/granitecitybrawlers/"&gt;Granite City Brawlers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/GraniteCityRollerDerby/"&gt;Granite City Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/dundeerollergirls/"&gt;Dundee Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In change from the norm, there will be no advanced ticket sales for this event. Instead in celebration of their 4th birthday BCR are inviting spectators to pay what they want on the day. That's right, &lt;span class="_4n-j fsl"&gt;just turn up on the game and pay whatever you like.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game will take place at Grangemouth Sports Complex on Saturday the 15th of October, doors will be open from 2.15pm and first whistle will be at 2.40pm, for more information &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/527945357409228/"&gt;visit the event page here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For fans of Scotland's first Co-ed league, the good news is that this weekend sees the end of the drought, as BCR host a double-header of roller derby action in traditional venue &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Grangemouth+Sports+Complex/@56.0116517,-3.7227819,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x488879aaeb85b4ed:0x204ad804f85c6304!8m2!3d56.0116487!4d-3.7205879"&gt;Grangemouth Sports Complex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, from &lt;strong&gt;2pm Saturday.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, BCR's women's team, the &lt;strong&gt;Central Belters&lt;/strong&gt;, will be taking to the track against &lt;strong&gt;Belfast City Rockets&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the Belters' first bout in their new kit - retiring the old grey-and-green in favour of a new logo (a howling wolf) in what used to be the Skelpies-only scheme of red-and-blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belfast City are ranked by FlatTrackStats as extremely close in power to the Central Belters - the bout is assigned as being &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/80412/rankings"&gt;almost 50:50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for each team to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this, it's Bairn City's men's team, the &lt;strong&gt;Skelpies&lt;/strong&gt;, up against Aberdeen's finest, the &lt;strong&gt;Granite City Brawlers &lt;/strong&gt;(who have also switched from Brawlermen to Brawlers since their founding). While the Brawlers have played several games in an unofficial or closed capacity, this is their first Public Bout, so it's a chance to see how the newest Scottish men's league perform!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As this is GCB's first bout, FlatTrackStats is unable to predict the result of this match up - but as GCB and the Skelpies both have skaters in Power of Scotland, it might be closer than you expect!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are available online at: &lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bairn-city-rollers-double-header-tickets-24929152767"&gt;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bairn-city-rollers-double-header-tickets-24929152767&lt;/a&gt; for only £6.34 (we assume the odd value is due to processing fees).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bairn city rollers</category><category>belfast city rockets</category><category>central belters</category><category>granite city brawlermen</category><category>skelpies</category><category>upcoming bouts</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/05/31/bairn-city-roll-into-2017/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2016 10:53:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Interview with BCR and CCRD Captains after their first clash</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/03/11/interview-with-bcr-and-ccrd-captains-after-their-first-clash/</link><dc:creator>despicablev</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently Bairn City Rollers, Skelpies welcomed Capital Citys Mighty Unicorns in what was their first game against each other and the first game in the newly created Scottish Men's Roller Derby Nationals (SMRDNs). We caught up with both team captains to find out their thoughts on their first encounter and the first game of the SMRDNs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dreads #5 Skelpies Captain (D)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Despicable V #5 Mighty Unicorns Captain (V)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You Both recently made captains of your respective teams, How did it feel to make Captain and lead your team in the first ever SMRDNs game?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; I was our vice captain for the past two years so I suppose that kind of helped with the preparation. With this being the first ever Nationals there was obviously a bit of pressure but I’m glad that I did it. I’m pleased with our win but this game shows we’ve still got plenty to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V:&lt;/strong&gt; I had only been captain for about three weeks before our game and have to admit it was a bit of a shock being voted in as I was up against some tough competition within CCRD for it. It was a bit daunting as this was only our second game and Tequila had done such a great job as captain at our last, so I had big boots to fill. It was all a bit like a baptism of fire as everything passed so quickly from being made captain till after the game. We knew it was always going to be a tough game as the Skelpies are a tough team, congratulations to them on the win they really made us work for every point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/03/dreads2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-4589 size-full" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/03/dreads2.jpg" alt="dreads blocking" width="550" height="367"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Picture courtesy of Laura MacDonald&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Both teams contained skaters who played with Power of Scotland at the world cup last year, including yourselves. Was it strange to skate against people who you used to look to as teammates?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; To be honest I’m just impressed that I didn’t try to wall up with the wrong skaters or take a whip from one of them! In a way the game was similar to the PoS Team Blue vs Team White game last year in that I was both playing against and alongside my PoS teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V:&lt;/strong&gt; Like Dreads said it was a bit like the PoS vs PoS game last year. It was odd having some skaters on the opposition who I've played with in PoS and the jakeys and I did find myself a couple of times having to think twice when I saw one of the skelpies i had skated with previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This was the first time that both teams have played each other and was only CCRD’s second game. How do you feel CCRD played for their second game?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; Having watched the footage I don’t think an outsider would have known that this was only CCRD’s second game. Both teams have very similar playing styles (Venus and Ginge have a lot to do with that!) which meant that The Mighty Unicorns were a really tough opponent and those walls were far stronger than any team only on their second game should have!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm really proud of our performance as all of our skaters really dug down deep throughout the game played their socks off. Since the game I've had a lot of people tell me just how impressed they were by us and how if they didn't know, they would have never have guessed it was only our second game. The Bairns really pushed us hard and took a  lead in the first half but no one got disheartened or lost their focus, which is why i think we managed to dig in and pull ourselves back into the game in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/03/v1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-4590 size-full" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/03/v1.jpg" alt="Despicable V" width="500" height="431"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Picture courtesy of Laura MacDonald&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Both teams had a mixture of newer and experienced skaters, how do you think your newer skaters played?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; Our newer guys ended up getting a lot more track time than any of us, including them, expected so really that speaks for itself! Everyone held their own that day but the other side of it is that I now expect this from them every time they’re on skates now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V:&lt;/strong&gt; I have to say how impressed I am with all our newer skaters. They really played their socks off and have progressed so much. Some have been training longer with CCRD than others, but all are doing and did so amazingly well and showed everyone how far they have come along. All of our skaters were on track roughly the same amount give or take a couple of jams which shows how much confidence we have in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The only other Scottish vs Scottish mens game so far was BCR vs Mean City last year and BCR took the win. Dread's how does it feel being the undefeated champion against men’s scottish teams?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve still got the Mean City rematch to come so I won’t say too much just now just in case but so far I’m loving it but now we’ve got the added pressure to make sure we keep this up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/03/dreads1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-4588 size-full" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/03/dreads1.jpg" alt="Dreads" width="500" height="394"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Picture courtesy of Laura MacDonald&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dreads, seeing as you won your last encounter with Mean City by over 100 pts and they are your next and last opponent in the SMRDNs, are you quietly confident that you can win the game and the SMRDNs for this year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a difficult one, we’ve scrimmed MCRD a couple of times since we last played them and each time they’ve played a very different game so they’re quite unpredictable. Much like CCRD, both teams have a few skaters who have played together with PoS and/or The Jakey Bites so this should be another really good game to play in and hopefully for the fans too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/03/v2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-4591" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/03/v2.jpg" alt="Picture courtesy of Laura MacDonald" width="500" height="396"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Picture courtesy of Laura MacDonald&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What can people expect from your teams at their next SMRDNs game?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; Hopefully some new faces, new tactics and a win, maybe another cheesy hashtag. We’ve got a couple of games before we face Mean City so they’ll also be a chance to see what to expect in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V:&lt;/strong&gt; We have about another 6 ish months till we take on Mean City in the last SMRDNs game this year, so hopefully we will have some new faces in our ranks as we have a few fresh meat coming through who should be mins passed by then. We also have a few games planned between now and then so our newer guys will get some more game experience under their belt. On top of that, we have been watching the game footage and taking notes for things that we need to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When will be the next time your teams will be in action? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; The Skelpies will be back in action again at home in April when we take on the Knights of Oldham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for BCR vs CCRD, to the best of my knowledge there’s nothing planned yet for another game. But now that this game is out the way we can train together and scrim fairly regularly for the benefit of both teams (possibly featuring some of our Granite City Brawlermen pals?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V:&lt;/strong&gt; We were working on an away game in April, which unfortunately now isnt happening so Capital City's next game should be our next home game on the 16th of May.&lt;/p&gt;

Many of the skaters from leagues taking part are now eagerly awaiting their first game in what is Europe's largest Roller Derby tournament, comprising 72 women’s leagues from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Along with 10 men's leagues also competing in the men's side of the tournament. With all this going on you may be fooled into thinking that this is the next big new competition for women's and men’s derby, and you may be right. But here in Scotland we now have something new and very exciting to look forward to with our men's derby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a considerable amount of discussions between Scottish Men's Derby Leagues over the last couple of years, there will be a brand new tournament taking place this year. The 28th of February 2015 will go down in Scottish derby history as the opening day and first ever game of the newly created &lt;a title="A run down on the Scottish Men’s Roller Derby League/Scottish Men’s Roller Derby (SMRD) Nationals" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/01/10/a-run-down-on-the-scottish-mens-roller-derby-nationals/"&gt;Scottish Men's Roller Derby Nationals (SMRDNs)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bairn City Rollers have the honor of hosting the first of the three games being played this year as part of the SMRDNs. This game will take place at Grangemouth Sports Complex on Saturday the 28th of February, doors are at 3pm and &lt;a href="http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/skelpies-vs-capital-city-roller-derby-tickets-15110714554"&gt;tickets are now available online&lt;/a&gt;. For more information on this visit the event page over on Facebook here: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1528686777405809/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/1528686777405809/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital City are a relatively new bouting team having played their first ever game in November of last year, whilst BCR have been bouting since 2013 and have six public bouts to their name.  It may be hard to believe, but this game will be only the second time that two Scottish Men's derby teams have played each other in a public bout. Out of all the three bouting Scottish men's leagues, only BCR and Mean City have played each other in a public bout. That encounter ended with BCR taking the win and the bragging rights.  So come the 28th, BCR will be making sure they will do everything possible to extend that undefeated run against Scottish men's derby opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides are expecting it to be an explosive encounter and great inaugural game for the SMRDNs. As starting with a win, will be the best way to be crowned the 2015 SMRDN champions, because both teams will only have 1 more SMRDN game to play this year. After the 28th, the two remaining games will be Mean City vs BCR and the East vs West line up of Capital City v Mean City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With it being the first game in the newly created SMRDNs there has been a lot of excitement and interest in the game and if BCR Skater Archibald Wreck would have us believe there has been a furore of excitement in Russia and Japan since the game was announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/01/img_0062-copy.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-3151" alt="Bairn City's Belter Skelpers lining up for the team's first ever co-ed bout." src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/01/img_0062-copy.jpg?w=614" width="614" height="409"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Bairn City's Belter Skelpers lining up for the team's first ever co-ed bout. (Photo: Laura MacDonald)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bairn City Rollers have had a very busy year, managing almost one bout for every month, despite only starting in May. While it's certainly made an impression on Scottish derby, how has the pace affected the league as a whole?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Skelpies only played 3 public bouts, so we have found it very manageable.
I think the Belters found it okay as their roster grew quite rapidly during 2013, so each bout had 5/6 "cherry poppers" in their line up. Most of the girls have also just come out of their first year with an abundance of priceless experience after going head to head with some top teams like Furness Firecrackers, Rainy City and Lothian Derby Dolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of course, the majority of those bouts were women's bouts, with the Central Belters taking on a rather varied selection of opponents. What was your favourite bout that the Belters played? Are there particular opponents you're planning to make rematches with?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, the bout against Preston.
In my opinion, August 25th was a turning point for the Belters. They had had a massive turn around in personnel, with the new girls coming in an doing an incredible job. Seeing everyone gel so well on track was very pleasing to watch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Skelpies and the Belters have had invites to rematches flooding in, but we have also had interest from new opponents in equal measure.
We are planning on heading down to Barrow to play our good friends in Barrow Infernos again, so I'm looking forward to settling the score there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of rematches, the Central Belters' first win came in the Battle of Britain tournament, playing their very first opponents, Lothian Derby Dolls, once more. Just from the crowd reaction, it was clear that the win meant a lot to the team; tell us more about the Belters got there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The win against Lothian was a massive milestone for the girls. As you mentioned, the Dolls were their first opponents on the 18th of May. The Belters were beaten and have, since then, worked tirelessly to improve. The Belters spent the next few months bouting teams such as North Wales, Furness Firecrackers, Rainy City, Preston etc. and scrimming against even more.
Every week has shown steady improvement for the Belters, which came to fruition as they held their own at the Battle of Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meanwhile, your co-ed team, the Belter Skelpers, only managed to find one team to play them, and that a combination of Mean City and New Town working together.  Being one of the very first co-ed leagues in Scotland (and, indeed, the UK), has the disadvantage of providing very few opponents. How are Bairn City planning on improving competition in the co-ed game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belters Skelpers VS Mean Town was a lot of fun, and a very close game! We had quite a lot of feedback from people that watched the bout, saying how much fun they had.
There was interest in us playing coed bouts in England earlier on in the year, but we decided to concentrate on the Skelpies and Central Belters individually first.
We've also had quite a lot of mix teams come to Falkirk to scrim against us, which may hopefully spur a few public bouts in 2014.
Coed still seems a bit taboo with a percentage of the Derby community, but our doors are always open for people to come train with us to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Skelpies had the honour of starting off Bairn City's bouting year, playing South Wales Silures back in April to a packed crowd. They'll also be starting off the new year, playing Mean City on the 25th of January. How do you feel the Skelpies have developed over the year? Are you predicting a win to start off 2014?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Skelpies have played some tough opponents this year. We kicked things off against South Wales Silures in April, which contained many skaters that had previously skated for The Expendables in the 2012 European Championships. We then played against Tyne and Fear in June and a Barrow Infernos/Tyne and Fear mixed team in July, who speak for themselves. They were both very good teams.
Since then we have been doing nothing but train as hard as we can, scrim as often as we can and hopefully the benefits of that will be reaped throughout 2014.
I wouldn't like to predict anything against Mean City, in all honesty. Mean City will be a difficult team to beat with Konanbourg, Tea Virus, Whyte &amp;amp; MacDie and Zero G all making the Scotland roster. I have also played alongside BruiseDog, Blue Grass, Samikaze and Grizzly so I know what talent their team possesses.
We also have a few new faces ready to take to the track, who I am sure will more than raise a few eyebrows, however I'm not willing to give away too much!
I think both teams are evenly matched and it is poised to be an incredible bout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quite a few of Bairn City's Skelpies tried out for Power of Scotland, the Scottish Men's Roller Derby team, and many of them got in. How does it feel to have gone from "new league" to providing a reasonable chunk of the national team in so short a time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started Bairn City, I honestly wasn't too sure we would transcend above a recreational league however the competitive nature and desire to take individual development to that next level has been second to none. Everyone within the league has shown complete dedication to improvment and moving the league forward, so it feels incredible to see everyone's hard work paying off.
It made me so proud to see so many of my team mates being selected. Myself, Dreads (Dreadie Mercury) and Dead Hardy have been here from day one, with Baron and Shady joining a few months after.
I think we're over our honeymoon period though, and as they say "the hard work starts now."
Looking through the Scotland roster it's good to see Capital City, Mean City and the Brawlermen all being represented at this years World Cup. It will bring about a positive boost for men's derby in Scotland and I can't wait to see what 2014 will hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this year now over, can you tell us about Bairn City's plans for the future? What's coming up in 2014? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a few very exciting things going on behind closed doors, but I'm afraid Basha Roo might hip check me if I told you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Skelpies have a big year coming up, with some of us going to the World Cup in March. We also have a couple of details to iron out on a few more events, which I'm really looking forward to.
The Belters are also currently booking up their year, with a few away bouts that will see them leave the comfort of Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a whole, we hope 2014 turns out to be as fun as 2013, that we can continue to grow and introduce more people to the wonders of Roller Derby!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>bairn city rollers</category><category>bcr</category><category>belter skelpers</category><category>central belters</category><category>interviews</category><category>review of the year</category><category>skelpies</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/01/10/derby-review-2014-bairn-city-rollers/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2014 16:09:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Bairn City Rollers presents “Blockémon”</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/07/18/bairn-city-rollers-presents-blockemon/</link><dc:creator>graememcphail</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derby fans, we choose YOU!
