West Lothian Roller Derby</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/12/15/west-lothians-newest-league-west-lothian-roller-derby/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've covered quite a few new leagues in Scotland recently, and to our knowledge, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/westlothianrollerderby/"&gt;West Lothian Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; are the last of the list (although they were one of the first to appear this year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based in, well, West Lothian, the league is really just getting off the ground - and has a call out for support from anyone who can help them with costs and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We caught up with founder, Samantha "Queen C" Carruthers,  to ask her where the idea came from for the league, and where they were on the journey at present:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-12808 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/12/westlothiantmp.jpg" alt="westlothiantmp" width="404" height="404"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, where did the idea come from for the league?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well that's easy! My idea came from my passion for derby and the fact I'm studying business management. I can see the potential for an amazing team, who will be a charity/not-for-profit organisation. I want to bring communities together through roller derby and have had a really good response from communities who I have spoke to about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious issues have been getting funds for kit together, we are still struggling but I have no doubt this will come together. At the moment, we are still getting our name out there and trying to get people interested! We have had a lot of interest in a junior team, so we will have a junior and senior league! We aim to be training for the end of January&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've had loads of interest, more than 30 people wanting to start. So kit is a very very big issue."&lt;/p&gt;
