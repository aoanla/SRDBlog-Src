As well as a second WFTDA Playoffs showcasting Sweden, and giving the UK it's second chance at a Champs place, there's equally exciting action in the USA for Brussels Derby Pixies in California; the finals of Victoria's Statewide Stampede tournament in Australia; the start of Finland's Suomi Cup for 2019/2020... and much more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...but, perhaps most importantly, there's the first ever bout in Tallinn, Estonia, which is also the start of Estonia's first National Tournament series!&lt;/p&gt;

The coming few days, as well as seeing the first of the WFTDA Playoffs (with attendees from) also see the first in a regular series of Short Track events in the UK, a a gaggle of bootcamps and clinics from the UK to Argentina, and even more tournaments. In National tournaments, Chile hosts the 2nd and 3rd fixtures in its Torneo X, in Vi&lt;/p&gt;

In particular:
not one, but two Australian teams play in the first WFTDA Continental Cup of the season; and the first of two Playoffs for the Mexican National Tournament is held in Chihuahua over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also some high level action in London;  some international roller derby in Buenos Aires for the third weekend running; and a German Bundesliga D1 bout in Munich... plus a fantastic all weekend Bootcamp and officiating clinic in Malmö, Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

We have a lot of derby happening across the world, including a three-day bootcamp in Estonia (covering WFTDA, Roller Derby Sevens and Short Track), and even more variant games in Australia, as South Sea Roller Derby host another Rainbow Lightning tournament (which is a ruleset we'd love to see people try in Europe sometime).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Scotland, New Town Roller Derby host a Charity LGBT scrimmage, to support West Lothian Pride.&lt;/p&gt;

With people travelling across the world to attend, the schedule elsewhere is a little sparse, but there are still exciting things happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also included a bonus section in this week's roundup highlighting sessions at Rollercon itself which we think are either interesting, or important, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This list was updated on Thursday 18th to include late announced bouts on Sunday in Mexico and Argentina&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).

There's a bunch of exciting "summer" events on, though, which we should highlight up here: in the UK, Eastbourne Extreme takes derby outside and to the coast for a 2 day mixed tournament; in France, Saint-Gratien once again hosts the pan-France Tournament of 6 Regions; and in Bundaberg, Australia, the 2019 SKATE of Emergency continues to raise funds for emergency services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(We'd also like to highlight the next "Un sol para lxs oficialxs", raising travel funds for Argentinian officials to support Roller Derby across the country; and on a different note ALL-IN's Short Track Experiment event in Leeds, exploring the new ruleset and how it might help to sustain &amp;amp; develop the sport.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article amended on Tuesday for two late announced fixtures in Spain and Mexico.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;
