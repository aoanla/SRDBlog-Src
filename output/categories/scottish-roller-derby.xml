We have a double dose of action in Argentina, with Indias Roller Derby of Quilmes, and recently Continental Cup winners, Sailor City Rollers both hosting multi-bout events! There's also excitement in Scotland, as the selection bout for Men's World Cup team, Power of Scotland is on in Dundee... and we have a Tuesday event in Slovenia as Roller Derby Ljuljana screen Whip it! for Pride!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

As well as a second WFTDA Playoffs showcasting Sweden, and giving the UK it's second chance at a Champs place, there's equally exciting action in the USA for Brussels Derby Pixies in California; the finals of Victoria's Statewide Stampede tournament in Australia; the start of Finland's Suomi Cup for 2019/2020... and much more!&lt;/p&gt;

For much of the past year, Edinburgh's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://auldreekierollerderby.com"&gt;Auld Reekie Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; have sad members of that club, despite what should have been one of their strongest and most successful years so far. ARRD have been training hard for the European Continental Cup in Helsinki (and maintaining their ranking to get there in the first place), and ARRD B have been hard at work in British Championships as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers will remember that ARRD lost Meadowbank Sports Centre - their hosting venue for all of their bouts since 2009, as well as one of their core training venues - back in December 2017, due to its closure for redevelopment. This obviously caused significant stress in their scheduling for 2019, including the need to find a new hosting venue capable of supporting their expected attendance. This year's games have been hosted in what's become a common venue for Edinburgh and Midlothian roller derby, Dalkeith Community Campus, which, whilst lovely, is much smaller than the Meadowbank, and considerably less central.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this July, this was compounded by the decision, with little notice, by Edinburgh Leisure (the City Council's provider of sport and leisure services) that access to Broughton and Holyrood High, another of their regular training venues, would be terminated. This came as a particular shock to the league, as they had been using the venue for many years with no issues. (Edinburgh Leisure were, and are, also responsible for Meadowbank, and had previously promised to support the league in finding alternative venues, with little actual results on their part.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losing such a large fraction of their training space, and schedule, was as traumatic to the league's functioning as you would expect, and it became a matter of existential urgency to find alternative spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, other providers are more enlightened, and ARRD have been delighted to announce that &lt;strong&gt;Leith Community Centre&lt;/strong&gt; will be their new regular training venue from this month; joining their remaining loyal and regular venue of many years, the Jack Kane Sports Centre, in supporting Roller Derby in Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement released as part of ARRD's press release on this news, Auld Reekie All-Stars Captain Crazylegs said “We are absolutely delighted to be entering into a new relationship with Leith Community Centre, and it couldn’t have come at a better time, when cuts to sports funding and shortage of sports hall provision has caused some real problems for us. Despite these issues, our All Stars have kept their focus and continued to work hard and we’re so proud to have qualified for the Continental Cup - it’s a real testament to the team’s depth and drive. It would be lovely to feel like our own city supported us in our achievements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>auld reekie roller derby</category><category>fundraising</category><category>scottish roller derby</category><category>support</category><category>tournament</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/09/ARRD-Leith-2019/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2019 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Weekend Highlights: 31 August 2019</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/highlights/2019/weekendhighlights-31082019/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekend has a particularly large event in Australia (Australia's largest Mixed Teams tournament), but no less exciting tournaments in France, and in Poland, where Poznań hosts a 6 team Roller Derby Sevens tournament. There's also a bunch of open scrimmages across the world, especially in the UK; and in Chile there's an open-subscription variant rules event which looks quite interesting (and tiring...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space. In this case, there's three Argentine events, because we really want to highlight how much exciting stuff is happening in Latin America right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was edited on the 1st August to include late announced events in Dubai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

tournament event, &lt;em&gt;Chaos on the Clyde&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/884747741612081/"&gt;FB&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/17770"&gt;FTS&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120829101350/https://www.glasgowrollerderby.com/bouts-events/bouts-eventschaos2012/"&gt;WEB&lt;/a&gt; ). (This was also around the time that the National Museum of Roller Derby was getting going, and
so, as well as the international competition, the NMRD stall also helped to develop derby in different senses.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, thanks to the venue used being closed not long after, and other suitable venues being inaccessible, it's been 6 years now until Glasgow Roller Derby have been able to bring back the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Image of flyer for Chaos on the Clyde 2." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/07/Chaos2019flyer.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, back it is, with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/854543498244493/https://www.glasgowrollerderby.com/events-calendar/2019/8/17/chaos-on-the-clyde-2"&gt;Chaos on the Clyde 2&lt;/a&gt; hosted in GRD's regular venue of the ARC in late August this year!&lt;/p&gt;

We have a lot of derby happening across the world, including a three-day bootcamp in Estonia (covering WFTDA, Roller Derby Sevens and Short Track), and even more variant games in Australia, as South Sea Roller Derby host another Rainbow Lightning tournament (which is a ruleset we'd love to see people try in Europe sometime).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Scotland, New Town Roller Derby host a Charity LGBT scrimmage, to support West Lothian Pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).

Their two wins in their first two Champs games saw them sit third in their group with six points despite having played one less game than the two teams above them, who had played three each. Their next two games came against those two teams: first they took on North Wales Mens and then T&amp;amp;F: Inglorious B*Stars. Both opponents took the wins in very hard fought games ending their 2019 Champs season 1st and 2nd in the group, 2 weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="British Champs Tier 2 M N leaderboard, showing the current state of play, including BCR at the middle of the table." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/06/MRDAside2-2019.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst those two teams have finished their champs season, the other teams in the group still have one more game and each team still has everything to play for. The last game day of Tier 2 North takes place on Scottish ground, with BCR hosting this fantastic battle at Grangemouth Sports Complex on the 29th of June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This double header could not have been set up more perfectly for the final set of games, as each match is a decider and will see the teams involved fighting for their final position against their opponent. Hosts BCR will be taking on The Inhuman League, with the winner of that game finishing 3rd in the group and the loser coming 4th. Whilst the other game will see Knights of Oldham play Teesside Skate Invaders, with the loser unfortunately ending up with the wooden spoon for the tier, and facing potential relegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both games are shaping up to be quite a close battle as by their results so far each are evenly matched. So every team will be pulling out all the stops to get that final win in this years champs competition to finish above their opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doors are at 1.15pm and tickets are only £5 on the door, find out more and keep up to date on the Facebook event page &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/events/2402082363156371/"&gt;https://en-gb.facebook.com/events/2402082363156371/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good weekend for tournaments - with two tournaments of interest to us in the USA (ECDX, where a lot of European, as well as US, teams try to get last-minute games for WFTDA eligibility requirements; and Hawai'i's Big Island Brawl, as Okinawa are there); but also two National or quasi-National tournaments in Europe (Spain's first ever Division 2 playoffs, and the sort-of-Italian-national-tournament Skake Im Ring).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;
