We have a double dose of action in Argentina, with Indias Roller Derby of Quilmes, and recently Continental Cup winners, Sailor City Rollers both hosting multi-bout events! There's also excitement in Scotland, as the selection bout for Men's World Cup team, Power of Scotland is on in Dundee... and we have a Tuesday event in Slovenia as Roller Derby Ljuljana screen Whip it! for Pride!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

February saw the Womens Roller Derby World Cup blow everyone away and now, thankfully, we are past its comedown. But it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; time to get ready for the Men’s Roller Derby World Cup, which kicks off on the 5th of April in Barcelona. This is the third MRDWC; the first was held in England back in 2014, and the second was two years ago in Canada. Back at the first World Cup in 2014, 15 nations battled it out, that tally rose to 21 in Canada, and this year at Barcelona there will be 24 nations represented, with even more set to join in at the next MRDWC after this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/PowerOfScotland/"&gt;Power of Scotland&lt;/a&gt; has featured at every MRDWC so far with its roster comprised of skaters from all over Scotland, as well as some from South of the border. From the first MRDWC to the current POS lineup going to Barcelona, &lt;a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers/"&gt;Bairn City Rollers&lt;/a&gt; has had its skaters featured in each of the squads. BCR's Gibb is one of only three skaters in the current PoS roster who have been present on all three of Power of Scotland’s final World Cup squads to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-26515 size-large" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/03/20180321_204818.jpg?w=700" alt="Power of Scotland and Bairn City Skater Gibb #5" width="700" height="351"&gt; Power of Scotland and Bairn City Skater Gibb #5 (Credit: Andy Mo Photography)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the first World Cup &lt;a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers/"&gt;BCR&lt;/a&gt;’s current or past skaters accounted for over quarter of the POS squad. At the last MRDWC in 2016, six current or past BCR skaters made it onto the training squad, of which four made it into the final squad that traveled to Canada. This time around, partially thanks to injuries and retirements, they have two skaters who made the training squad and both will be at Barcelona with Power of Scotland. One will be skating (Gibb) and the other now as part of the staff (rEd Baron).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCR are proud that they have skaters once again involved with of Power of Scotland at this World Cup. They are also very proud of their skaters' (past and present) achievements representing and playing for Power of Scotland since its inception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-26514 size-large" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/03/20180321_204752.jpg?w=700" alt="Power of Scotland and Bairn City skater Red Baron" width="700" height="352"&gt; Power of Scotland and Bairn City skater rEd Baron (Credit: Andy Mo Photography)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst we are used to seeing some faces from outside of Scotland in POS squads, we are not used to seeing our male skaters in Scotland appearing elsewhere on other National teams. That was until now! At this MRDWC there will be a couple of skaters that play and train in Scotland who will be representing nations other than Scotland, and both hail from Bairn City Rollers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers/"&gt;BCR&lt;/a&gt; are incredibly honoured and proud to say that in their ranks they have skaters who will be representing not one, not even two, but three different nations at Barcelona. On the track at the tournament along with Gibb representing Power of Scotland they will have Oliver lining up for &lt;a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/WalesMensRollerDerby/"&gt;Team Wales&lt;/a&gt; and Vezzani for &lt;a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/mensrollerderbyteamitaly/"&gt;Team Italy&lt;/a&gt;.
If you follow Men’s Derby in Scotland Oliver and Vezzani’s faces will be familiar but perhaps their names not-so-much: they have opted, like many, to play under their real surnames. Normally you would see Oliver playing under his derby name of Basha ROO, and Vezzani as Despicable V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-26512 size-large" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/03/20180321_204624.jpg?w=700" alt="Team Italy and Bairn City skater Vezzani (Despicable V)" width="700" height="352"&gt; Team Italy and Bairn City skater Vezzani (Despicable V)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Oliver and Vezzani in their past have represented Power of Scotland (both made the 2016 training squad), with Vezzani representing POS at the first MRDWC. Both have now decided that, going forward, they wish to represent other nations instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-26513 size-large" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/03/20180321_204726.jpg?w=700" alt="Team Wales and Bairn City skater Oliver (Basha ROO)" width="700" height="352"&gt; Team Wales and Bairn City skater Oliver (Basha ROO)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to Oliver about why he decided to try out for Wales he said:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;My mum's side of the family are all from Wales and are passionately Welsh, even my Gran who was originally from Birmingham, so it was a bit of a no brainer to play for Team Wales when I got the chance. The last World Cup, I couldn't commit to traveling down to Wales for training regularly and flying to Canada, financially and work wise. Thankfully this time round I was in a position to be able to.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Vezzani has a similar story for Italy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;At the first MRDWC there was no Team Italy, currently in Italy there are really no Men’s teams/leagues. They do have the Woodgang, which is a team made up of skaters from all over Italy and a few other places. A little like how we had the Jakey Bites here in Scotland. When I tried out for POS for the 2016 World Cup there was no Team Italy, they only appeared very late in the day after I had already made the POS training squad.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When I didn’t make the final 20, quite a few people said to me about trying out for Italy instead. But because I had already made one countries training squad for that world cup I decided against it. Although when I watched and cheered on Italy at the World Cup I realised then, I really wished I had. At that point I decided that if I was going to try out for any Nation going forward it was going to be Italy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
We also asked both how friends, family and team mates reacted when they found out that they would be representing Wales or Italy.
&lt;p&gt;Oliver:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Family have been really supportive about me playing in the World Cup for Wales, so much so that they are coming to Barcelona to come and watch. My mum's gone full Welsh fan-girl so expect lots of daffodils and dragons, lol. My team mates are pleased for me as well although a few wished I had picked Power of Scotland instead.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Vezzani:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;When it came to trying out last year, I had told a couple of people that I had wanted to but never told anyone when I was actually going to do it. It was only when I played my first game for Italy in November last year (at the Road to Barcelona tournament in Holland) that everyone found out I had tried that also included 99% of BCR as I had managed to keep it a secret. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The response from friends and teammates has been fantastic and everyone has been really supportive. My dad is really proud and happy that I will be representing Italy and my sister seems to be the most excited by it all, even more than me. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
We all know that at the previous MRDWCs, Scotland’s fans have become well known for their support, sheer volume, and chanting for not only for Scotland but other Nations they take a liking to.
Seeing as both Oliver and Vezzani are Scotland-based skaters, they will be hoping that they will get some support from the Scottish fans when they take to the track in Barcelona. Here at SRD, we do hope that the Scottish fans at Barcelona and back home will be celebrating and cheering on both of these skaters, and the Welsh and Italian teams.. at least, when they are not playing against Power of Scotland!&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>bairn city rollers</category><category>bcr</category><category>men's roller derby world cup</category><category>mrdwc</category><category>mrdwc 2018</category><category>power of scotland</category><category>team italy mens</category><category>team wales mens</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/27/bairn-city-rollers-central-scotlands-international-derby-league/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 10:09:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Seeing in the New: National Teams in Dundee.</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/02/10/seeing-in-the-new-national-teams-in-dundee/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekend sees a double-dose of National Teams action for those in Scotland, as Dundee hosts a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1382676465099043/"&gt;combined event&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with Team Scotland Roller Derby and Power of Scotland both on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-14736 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/02/tspostb.jpg" alt="tspostb" width="1071" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, the Training Team for Team Scotland will be holding a Black v White bout, competing against themselves as part of the selection process for the new Team Scotland. After playing as two teams last weekend in Belgium (and winning both games), all of the skaters will be at their best, and bringing you (by definition), the highest level roller derby in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the Power of Scotland roster from the 2016 Men's World Cup will be playing their swansong bout, against Team Belgium Men's Roller Derby. Symbolically, this is their passing of the torch to the new Power of Scotland training team, who are currently undergoing the selection process after their tryouts in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the close connection between the National Teams, we were delighted to be able to talk with Rosie Peacock (PoS 2016 LUM/Assistant Coach, TS 2017/8 Head Coach) and Laura "Milky" Liston (PoS 2016 Coach, member of TS 2017/8 Training Team) about things. Between them, the two were selected to Captain the Team Scotland rosters in Belgium, so they have a great feel for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First question, then: How did it feel to be selected as a Captain for the bouts last weekend?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rosie:&lt;/em&gt; So, Milky captained both in the end because I had too much caffeine and got super radge... Me and Milks were the only two who were nominated, but it was good the team trusted us to do the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laura&lt;/em&gt;: It was lovely knowing some of the team had nominated us, and it was such an amazing opportunity to Captain the squad, but yeah, we were the two nominated haha&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, following up on that: Team Scotland won both their games, with both rosters against Belgium. How do you feel the games went - what are you happiest about, and is there anything you might work on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rosie&lt;/em&gt;: I think outer defence side walls are really tight and fluid and adaptive; I'd love to work more on our offer credit and jammer pairings, but that's something we can't progress too much further until we have our final squad and definitely establish roles...
I need to keep my temper and not drink red bull when pmsing 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laura&lt;/em&gt;: I really loved some of the bonds and partnerships we starting building on track, which I think were really apparent throughout the day. I'm looking forward to seeing how they develop in the final squad. Both of the games brought different challenges so it was great to see how we adapted to the change in gameplay style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And moving to this weekend: obviously we can't talk too much about selection itself, but clearly everyone there is hoping to make the final selection - do you see changes in both your own performance (and gelling) and your teammates already at this point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laura&lt;/em&gt;: Oh definitely. The opportunity to skate with so many high level skaters has really helped strengthen my skating on a personal level. We've been lucky enough to have Belgium and Cardiff to gel as a team in a competitive environment, and I think both have made a really noticeable improvement to our performances as a team together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both of you have strong connections with Power of Scotland, especially the 2016 Squad who are playing as well - against Belgium! - we know the team are treating this as a "sending off" of the old team, but will a tiny tear be in your eyes to see them playing together for the last time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laura&lt;/em&gt;: Hah! I think I got all my emotions out in Calgary when the whole squad was there. It'll be great to see the guys playing together again but I'm looking forward to seeing what our new squad will look like, and so excited about the future of PoS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rosie&lt;/em&gt;: I'm looking so forward to playing the best sport in the world, with the best group of humans I've had the pleasure to know x&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doors open for the double header at &lt;strong&gt;11:30, Saturday 11th&lt;/strong&gt; February, at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/DISC:+Dundee+International+Sports+Centre/@56.4762694,-2.9611212,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48865cfd69198245:0x74e93fd03837f5ac!8m2!3d56.4762665!4d-2.9589272"&gt;Dundee International Sports Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The new team will be managing Power of Scotland as they prepare for the 2018 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://mrdwc.com/"&gt;Men's World Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to give you a rundown of the Positions and their holders:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Team Manager - Nikki Morris&lt;/h3&gt;
Returning to the role of Team Manager from the 2016 squad, Nikki is also a member of the MRDWC Committee, playing a strong role in progressing the International game itself.
When she's not involved with the International game, Nikki is a manager of Granite City Brawlers, Aberdeen's open Roller Derby league.
&lt;h3&gt;Bench Coach - Laura "Milky" Liston&lt;/h3&gt;
Milky is also returning from coaching PoS to the World Cup in Calgary this year. Now something like a quadruple threat, as referee, coach, blocker and jammer, she's also on the (Women's) Team Scotland Training Team, and is still one of Dundee Roller Girls' top skaters. She also has the distinction of having Bench Coached Madrid's Mad Riders at Men's European Cup 2016, despite not speaking Spanish.
Milky is a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXySN7hUTbQGCepCzq5ifeS5qK9dglaRXZxchv0kymMGuzUg/viewform?c=0&amp;amp;w=1"&gt;Talk Derby To Me Listener Awards Nominee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for the Hero of the Year category.
&lt;h3&gt;LUM Coach/Line Up Manager - "McDonagh"&lt;/h3&gt;
McDonagh, or Owl,  was a rostered skater for Power of Scotland's 2016 World Cup run, and has stepped up as Assistant Coach for Barcelona. When not on the National Team, Owl skates for Nottingham Roller Derby's Super Smash Brollers (British Champs T2 Men's), and coaches Nottingham Roller Derby's Women's A team (British Champs T3 West).
&lt;h3&gt;Support Coaches - rEd Baron, Phoenix&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;em&gt;These two new positions were added this time around, to provide additional coaching support.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rEd Baron was on the roster for the 2016 World Cup in Calgary, as well as for the original 2014 team that played in Birmingham. When he's not on the National Team, he skates for and coaches at Bairn City Rollers (the Skelpies debuting in British Champs T3 North Men's this year), and has provided support for many other teams, including Team Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phoenix is currently a member of Glasgow Men's Roller Derby (British Champs T3 North) [MRDA's rules are very gender accepting], having transferred from Glasgow Roller Derby, where she was a rostered A-team skater, this year. She has extensive coaching experience from her time in GRD, and is also a member of the Team Scotland Training Squad.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Head Official - Mags Payne&lt;/h3&gt;
Returning from last time, Mags Payne will be providing her experience and contacts to the National Team, arranging officials for their practices and any bouts along the way, as well as keeping them in line. When she's not providing her knowledge to PoS, Mags referees for Auld Reekie Roller Girls, and also contributes to the WFTDA Rules committee. We recently talked to Mags about her refereeing, so you can read more &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/10/12/an-interview-with-mags-payne/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
Mags is a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXySN7hUTbQGCepCzq5ifeS5qK9dglaRXZxchv0kymMGuzUg/viewform?c=0&amp;amp;w=1"&gt;Talk Derby To Me Listener Awards Nominee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for the Referee category, and Tournament Head Referee for ARRGmageddon, which is a Nominee in the Event category.
&lt;h3&gt;Team Sports Therapist - Goldginger&lt;/h3&gt;
Also returning from last time,  Goldginger is a fully trained professional Sports and Remedial Massage Therapist, and accompanied the team to Calgary to provide post-game therapy, as well as fundraising with her skills in the build up to the trip. When she's not doing sports therapy, she also skates for Dundee Roller Girls' A team, and is on the Team Scotland Training Squad.
Goldginger is a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXySN7hUTbQGCepCzq5ifeS5qK9dglaRXZxchv0kymMGuzUg/viewform?c=0&amp;amp;w=1"&gt;Talk Derby To Me Listener Awards Nominee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for the Breakout Star category.
&lt;h3&gt;Team Photographer - Laura MacDonald&lt;/h3&gt;
Our final position, and another returnee. Laura was Team Photographer at the Calgary World Cup; when she's not photographing for the National Team she's an independent Roller Derby Photographer, mostly covering the Central Belt of Scotland (Fierce Valley Roller Girls, Bairn City Rollers, but also Mean City Roller Derby, Ayrshire Roller Derby, Lothian Derby Dolls, Dundee Roller Girls and others).
Laura is a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXySN7hUTbQGCepCzq5ifeS5qK9dglaRXZxchv0kymMGuzUg/viewform?c=0&amp;amp;w=1"&gt;Talk Derby To Me Listener Awards Nominee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for the Photographer category.
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to tryout to skate in the Men's National Team, supported by the above, there are two training dates: &lt;strong&gt;14 Jan 2017&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1133482293431082/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/1133482293431082/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;] and &lt;strong&gt;29 Jan 2017&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1805159703057798/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/1805159703057798/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;] both in Grangemouth.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-9430 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/14380016_10100686642377194_6212990695481911800_o.jpg" alt="14380016_10100686642377194_6212990695481911800_o" width="1600" height="1600"&gt; Mags Payne (centre) Photograph by: Laura MacDonald&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, first, let's start with the introductions: Who are you, Mags Payne?&lt;/strong&gt;
Mags Payne is an NYPD cop, hell-bent on vengeance after the murder of his wife and child..wait. No. That's MAX Payne. I am Mags Payne, referee with ARRG, Power of Scotland's Head Official for 2015/2016, Agent of S.T.R.I.P.E, and MRDA Recognised Official. I've been refereeing for 4 years. I'm also a Crazy Cat Lady, follower of the Winnipeg Jets, and all-round nerd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, in your day job, you're a technical writer. Quite a few referees have day jobs in contexts which require attention to detail, and an ability to apply complex rules - do you think Refereeing appeals because the skills are already there, or is it the other way around (that you Referee for the same reason you have the jobs you have).&lt;/strong&gt;
I think in a lot of ways, competent refs are born rather than made! There's a lot of things that are incredibly important for refs, that you can't really learn - it's a character trait you just have to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like you've mentioned, attention to detail is important, but you have to be able to pay attention to a lot of detail at once. You have to focus without being &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; focused on one thing. You also have to be able to think on your feet - that doesn't mean you have to be super smart, but simply you can think fast with clarity. Every awesome ref I can think of has a lot of the same traits: fast thinking, calm under pressure, walks a fine line between eye on the minutiae and keeping the bigger picture in mind, and a fair lack of ego. I think certain kinds of people are drawn to reffing. And you'll see a lot of the attributes required to ref showing up in their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You were selected as Power of Scotland's Head Official for 2015/2016. What did that involve, how did it feel, would you do it again?&lt;/strong&gt;
I revolved between being chuffed and terrified when they chose me! I would go and ref their practices and feed back any sort of 'ref' thing I noticed. So; highlighting if someone was particularly getting clockwise blocks, and what they were doing that was causing it. The guys made me feel absolutely welcome, despite the fact that 90% of my interactions with them was blowing my whistle and yelling at them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have absolutely loved the experience though - it felt like a really collaborative relationship, and it gave me a lot of confidence that I hadn't had before. When you've head reffed a scrim between the best male skaters in Scotland and Mild Discomfort, it does kind of give you a little confidence boost! Honestly, I would do it again in a heartbeat - it really was one of the best things I've ever applied for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You've also been raising your own crop of new refs, via the Ref School you ran with ARRG. Can we talk a bit about the importance of nurturing officials in the community like this?&lt;/strong&gt;
Honestly,I think sometimes leagues think refs grow on trees! And we've seen a swathe of referees retiring in the past couple of years, but not as many refs stepping up to fill their places. It also takes at least a year until people are about ready for some of the teams in Scotland! So really, I wanted to foster an environment where new referees could learn and grow, but also in a formalised way that meant there was a 'path' for them with a support network build in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes being an official can be a lonely endeavour - you're not really &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of a team as such. Although you're usually affiliated with a league, because you're always trying to remain professional and impartial, you can seem a little stand-offish. There's also the fact that when you're first starting out you're trying to build your confidence to make your calls, and be respected by the skaters as having the necessary authority. Having a weekly meeting (ours was in the backroom of a pub!), where you can chat and really go over the rules theory, in a friendly and supportive environment does wonders for new refs. I learned a lot from it too - cause sometimes they'd ask me things I'd never thought of! I'm only new to the head reffing thing, so I stole &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sleazethezebra.com/2015/06/26/allow-me-to-introduce-you-to-ref-school/"&gt;Von Sleaze's Ref School&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; wholesale. It was an absolute life line, and is set out in a great way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm quite protective of my new refs (I may have a few referees, and at least one PoS skater, who call me Mama Mags...) and I wanted them to have the confidence to ask questions. In fact, I laid down a rule of 'there are no such thing as stupid questions, just stupid people who think they know everything'. As a referee, you're always asking questions - did I see that? Did that have impact? Does this rule mean what I think it means? With the information I've just been given in this official review, was my call correct? It's something I really wanted to encourage people to do. Don't doubt yourself (you should only call what you're 100% about), but be open to being wrong, to asking questions, and always looking for the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that the guys found it useful, and I'd be looking to run it again in future. Dundee also does mini reffing bootcamps which new refs should definitely try and attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your next big Refereeing event is the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/MensEuropeanCup/?fref=ts"&gt;Mens's European Cup&lt;/a&gt;, hosted by Newcastle's Tyne and Fear! It's the Nth time you've been in Newcastle this year, but probably the biggest event: how are you preparing, and what are you most looking forward to?&lt;/strong&gt;
Honestly, I'm nervous as anything. Have you &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; the crews?! Trying to get over the 'superstar refs...and Mags' feeling is tough. But I've been trying to get as many opportunities to get some practice as possible, seeking feedback wherever I can get it, and upping my strength program. I basically want to be in the best possible shape I can be for it, physically and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really looking forward to meeting some of the 'big names' of officiating. Skaters have their big name heroes - we have it too! I'm also looking forward to meeting people like Duncan Disorderly and Momo whom I've spoken to on messenger etc, but never actually chatted to in real life. Big name heroes who might actually know my name! And it's always great to hang out with the Newcastle crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to do my tiny part to keep Scotland's officiating reputation high!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As well as all of this Roller Derby Officiating, you're also a keen gamer; we know you're taking a break from Refereeing this weekend for a good cause - can we end this article with a little look at that?&lt;/strong&gt;
Yes please! I'm playing video games for 30 hours this weekend to raise money for Edinburgh's Sick Kids Hospital. It's part of an event known as Sick Kids' Save Point. If you could throw me a pound, that would be AMAZING! &lt;a href="https://sksp.everydayhero.com/uk/magsthepirate"&gt;https://sksp.everydayhero.com/uk/magsthepirate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In the 2014 Men's Roller Derby World Cup Scotland were in Group Orange with Belgium, Canada and Japan. They were knocked out by our friends in Wales and shared 7th place with Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/06/fb_img_1448576822432.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="FB_IMG_1448576822432.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" alt="image" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/06/fb_img_1448576822432.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power of Scotland logo 2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke with Optimus Grime about Team Scotland in the run up to the 2016 Men's Roller Derby World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are preparations going for the world cup?      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are going very well. We have had a list of targets to reach, both on and off the track and are on  course to achieve them all. There have been a few bumps here and there, but they have just been flawless adjusted and things have seemlessly carried on. We are very pleased thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often do you train?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since day 1 we have known our training schedule which has been great for attendance. Huge credit to our training and management for sorting that out so early. We are training every 2nd sunday in Grangemouth. Turnouts are great, especially since 1/3 of the team live in areas of England. Each session has been really tough, but we are growing all the time and it gets better each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off skates training varies. There are no set team off skates training due to everyone living so far apart, but all skaters are pushing themselves more and more on and off the track. I know everyone is taking this very seriously and doing everything they can to be in the best condition they can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From which leagues have your players been selected?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a very big geographical distance in the roster. The entire list includes;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granite City Brawlers - Aberdeen
Bairn City Rollers - Falkirk
Mean City Roller Derby - Glasgow
Capital City Roller Derby - Edinburgh
New Wheeled Order - Manchester
Inhuman League - Sheffield
Super Smash Brollers - Nottingham
Southern Discomfort - London
Wirrel Pack Animals - Liverpool
Kings of Block &amp;amp; Roll - Exeter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management &amp;amp; Coaches:
Dundee Roller Girls
Auld Reekie Roller Girls
Granite City Brawlers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are your team goals for the World Cup?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite simply but realistically.....make it out of the group stages. Anything after that is a bonus. We are both fortunate and unfortunate to have a 6 team group. Fortunate for the chance to play so many teams from all over the world, but with that comes a higher chance of fatigue. We are very excited though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the group there is really only 1 slot available as USA will no doubt advance from the groups. With 5 teams battling for that space this will be extremely competitive, but we have the talent and desire to be that team that gets to the quarter finals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell me about your fundraising and sponsorship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have recieved some great sponsorship for the run up to the World Cup.
Mostly with our uniforms, merch and safety gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our sponsors are;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datum360
MP Locums
S1 Helmets
Witness the Fitness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would also like to offer a huge thank you to;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interplanetary Print Syndicate
Roller Derby City
Power of Greyskull
EDF Energy
The Whisky Wolf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fundraising has been a variety of coaching and event organisation.
We have had a sponsored; Beard shaves, Pub quizzes and Bungee jumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest source of fundraising have been bootcamps and guest coach sessions which have been as wide spread as our roster and even abroad.
Such as Belfast, Malaga and France. The biggest of which was our Big Bootcamp in Dundee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we expect to see from team Scotland at the World Cup?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically a huge improvement from our last world cup involvement. Not any less passionate, but far more strategic, skilled and patient, from both a jammer and blocker point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also alot of new faces, but plenty of previous ones too. Our roster is far more extensive than the last World Cup, just from the leagues people have come from. This has brought a big variety of skills to Power of Scotland this time around and has made for a very balanced team.
Finally, we hope to display a better performance &amp;amp; therefore ranking this time around. Moreover, show the world that we can still give the big boys a hard time on the track and be considered one of the better teams in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team Scotland are indeed in a six team group for the 2016 Men's Roller Derby World Cup. They are in Team Red with Finland, Ireland, Japan, Mexico and the USA. Their first game will be on Track 1 against Team USA at 11am Calgary time, 4am UK time...make some coffee although I'm sure the excitement will wake you up.&lt;/p&gt;

That's the only explanation for the preponderance of twos in this weekend's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/487160101472894/"&gt;upcoming event&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; they're hosting, at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/ARC:+Health+and+Fitness/@55.8662183,-4.2519236,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4888441f10416197:0x3a9426f40d4b58b7!8m2!3d55.8662153!4d-4.2497349"&gt;ARC Sports Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Glasgow.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7335" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/05/11707838_666231253513298_2828507735651128838_o.jpg?w=1024" alt="11707838_666231253513298_2828507735651128838_o" width="1024" height="384"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is this a double header, with &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; exciting bouts to experience, but both bouts have their own multiplicative factors as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headlining, we have Scotland's National Men's Roller Derby team, Power of Scotland, facing off against "The Other Guys" - the "&lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; best Scottish men's skaters" from four (&lt;em&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;!) Scottish leagues: Mean City themselves, Capital City, Bairn City's Skelpies and Granite City's Brawlermen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/PowerOfScotland/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power of Scotland&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;are less than two months away from the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://mrdwc.com/"&gt;World Cup in Calgary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and this is an important fixture both for training and also fundraising. As well as donations direct to PoS, the Team Physio (Dundee Roller Girls' Goldginger) Claire will be offering physio for donations [she also has a separate fundraiser &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.justgiving.com/Claire-Semple2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;] - and official Team Photographer Laura MacDonald will also be in attendance [she's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/PoSLauraCalgary"&gt;raising money too&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;!].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second up, Mean City's own co-ed team (who I don't think actually have a name yet) are facing off against a &lt;em&gt;double&lt;/em&gt;-league mashup of Capital City Roller Derby and Lothian Derby Dolls: "Fear and Lothian". The two Edinburgh-based leagues have been working pretty closely in preparation for this game, and we believe that Fear and Lothian is going to become a longer standing collaboration - there will be new merch available at the bout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With both bouts containing exhibition teams, there's no stats to predict the outcomes - so the only way to see what will happen is to come along!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://meancityrollerderby.com/tickets.php"&gt;£5 in advance&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;£6&lt;/strong&gt; on the door (under-14s free).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doors open at &lt;strong&gt;11:30am&lt;/strong&gt; for an approximately midday start this &lt;strong&gt;Saturday 28th May&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bairn city rollers</category><category>capital city roller derby</category><category>granite city brawlermen</category><category>lothian derby dolls</category><category>mean city roller derby</category><category>power of scotland</category><category>upcoming bouts</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/05/24/powers-of-two-at-mean-city/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2016 09:37:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>After Action Report: The Power of Scotland Bootcamp, April 2016</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/04/07/after-action-report-the-power-of-scotland-bootcamp-april-2016/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/PowerOfScotland"&gt;Power of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; continue on their road to Calgary, they gave the Scottish Roller Derby Community a chance to step into their world last weekend and share their skills, drills and only a few minor spills by hosting a fundraising bootcamp in Dundee. Keen to see exactly what the guys could offer, I snapped up a ticket as soon as they went on sale, and I'm fairly certain that I wasn't only person who was excited to see exactly what was on offer as there was a tremendous turn out.
Unless you have been living under a derby-proof rock, you will be very aware of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/02/15/power-of-scotland-fundraising-for-calgary/"&gt;amazing efforts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from the whole squad to ensure they arrive in Calgary ready to take on the other participating nations. They've raised money any way they could, from bungee jumping, beard shaving, scrimmage, coaching and selling merchandise at games across the country and now bootcamping (it's a word now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460057323219.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="wp-1460057323219" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460057323219.jpg" alt="image" width="1200" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Photo: &lt;a href="http://lauramacd.co.uk/roller-derby-photography/"&gt;Laura MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I am so excited by this bootcamp and possibly why I was asked to write this was my enthusiasm for the fantastic planning and flow of the whole day. These guys didn't throw this together overnight. They even had print-outs! I mean who doesn't love a bit of literature to look back on?! The whole squad pulled together and they really delivered.
The first part of the day was led by the wonderful Nuke. Now, Nuke is a lovely bloke and a fabulous skater to watch and I was very keen on learning from him. Leading the day with agility and footwork he put us through our paces and he stripped everything back to basics - I learned loads. I've skated since 2011/2012 and I had no idea that since mins I had forgotten how to step without my wheels rolling (Don't make me do mins again). The highlight, however, may have been Nuke's tartan leggings &amp;lt;3
Next up we had the lovely Blockbeard with his jamming skills session. Despite the name, everything he went through was very easily transferable to blockers. He broke the session down into evasive, attack and “Blammer” techniques - he really didn't hold back. His session led on from Nuke's agility session perfectly by incorporating the control and agility we had just learned. With an added technique on moving blocker twice your size with just a wee nudge. Thanks Pal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two solid hours of skating and it was time for lunch and an audience with Optimus Grime, Power of Scotlands very own Viking looking, hard hitting, softy. Those who know Grime, know that he has a background in bodybuilding. Who better to take us through a strength and conditioning seminar with bonus print-outs (I think he has surplus and may as well share). Highlighting some of the confusing things about weight training for performance and making it so easily understood was an incredible addition to the bootcamp. I already mentioned how much I loved the format and this for me was a very welcome aspect to incorporate in. Most people think that just skating will get you where you need to be, but Grime makes sure you know exactly how a little weight training will help improve your game even further, also talking a little about nutrition and the right things to eat pre and post-game/training. The chair demonstrations were also absolutely fabulous. [Editor's note: Optimus Grime's accompanying Mental Strength presentation was cut from the bootcamp due to time, but we have managed to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/04/07/guest-post-mental-strength-with-power-of-scotlands-optimus-grime/"&gt;publish a copy here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuelled up and ready to get back on skates our final session before the mixed scrim was led by Skate Plisken. This session was on effective offence. Plisken took us through a few offence techniques that we have all seen performed by the POS guys recently at scrims and they were most definitely effective. Including the beautifully named “Sausage” technique; I sincerely hope no sausages were offended ( HA!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day wasn't quite over yet; there was still a scrimmage to be had. We had 1 hour to test out everything we had learned over the course of the day with 2 members of POS being gifted to either side as Bench and LUM. Prior to the scrim Nuke and Plisken, who were LUM and Bench for Team White, sat us down and went over basic Scrim strategy. This was excellent; not only were newer skaters getting the chance to scrim but there was also time to talk about strategy, which we all know doesn't come easily. I'm not sure I can express my love for this bootcamp any more than I already have without sounding like a raving loon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout every session the boys were on hand to observe, advise and sometimes join in. The day was full of laughs and smiles but no one was holding back. Those who attended skated hard and gave it everything they could. Absorbing all of this information, everyone was eager to take it back to their home leagues and try it out - myself included. I had such a huge buzz from whole day and have been internalising everything I learned since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460057355236.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="wp-1460057355236" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460057355236.jpg" alt="image" width="1200" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Righteous Oxide drills the referees in their parallel bootcamp. (Photo: &lt;a href="http://lauramacd.co.uk/roller-derby-photography/"&gt;Laura MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was a whole separate side to the bootcamp that I cannot forget to mention, even though I wasn't a part of this side of things I know just how valuable it is to the derby community.
Up in the balcony of the hall there were both a Ref and NSO school going on. Led by Righteous Oxide (Dundee Roller Girls) and Fairy Nuff (Auld Reekie Roller Girls) the Refs were in excellent hands to advance through their Refereeing career, with sessions on positions, communication, and Head Referee responsibilities. It must have been amazing because they did a brilliant job during the scrim.
The NSO section was Hosted by Alix ( Dundee Roller Girls) and Peggy Krueger ( Auld Reekie Roller Girls) with sessions on NSO positions, communication, people management and Head NSO responsibilities. From what I hear it was amazing and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it.
It is absolutely imperative to the sport that we have Refs and officials available and the fact that POS were able to accommodate absolutely everyone was truly amazing. Skill levels did not matter to these lads, everyone had a place and they made it a complete success. I think I can speak for everyone when I say thank-you, POS for hosting such a fabulous bootcamp, for sharing your knowledge, kindness and to wish you all the best of Luck in Calgary.&lt;/p&gt;

For posterity, and to provide everyone with its benefits, Grime has written it up and graciously allowed us to publish it.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WARNING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is best consumed with epic 80's motivational soundtracks from such films as the Rocky series, Karate Kid or Commando [The editor would also like to recommend &lt;a href="http://powergloveaudio.bandcamp.com/album/ep-1"&gt;PowerGlove's EP1&lt;/a&gt; for a similar effect]. The author intent was for it to be spoken aloud &amp;amp; PROUD. Side effects may include feelings of Getupandgoitis, motivationarrhoea &amp;amp; goosebumposis!! You have been WARNED!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460021054231.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="wp-1460021054231" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460021054231.jpg" alt="image" width="699" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Unknown copyright: please let us know if this is your image.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental Strength:
It starts with a dream:
Conceive - A dream to achieve a goal. A dream to become something you can be proud of. Whether the goal is big or small is not important, as long as it IS important. It must mean something significant to you.
Believe - Thoughts .....become.....things. You must think about what it is you want and believe 100%, without any doubt that it is achievable. Doubts......will .......delay ......dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieve - For a goal to be a successful, a plan on how to achieve that goal must be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions need to be asked. How do I get there? What must I do? How long will it take? Who do I need to learn from? IT IS ABOUT THE REMOVAL OF VARIABLES. Variables lead to detriment, distraction &amp;amp; even destruction. Questions are variables and once all the questions are answered, the journey can begin.
It's about creating a foundation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a body to become proficient at something it must be practiced &amp;amp; built up from a foundation. The same applies to the mind. Treat your mind like a wall or building. The first brick in your foundation is a dream. It is the root of achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This initial brick in your foundation must be strong. To do this a decision has to be made. You have to decide to commit to this dream and with that endeavour to not quit on it until it is completed. Decision is an extremely difficult thing to do. It is scary, new and takes a huge effort, but in a way it is wonderfully frightening. Once the decision is made, the rest is much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decision is incision. To decide is to cut off the chance of being deterred or distracted away from completion of your goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just DECIDE. (Variable eliminated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460021066618.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="wp-1460021066618" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460021066618.jpg" alt="image" width="960" height="540"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Photo: &lt;a href="http://lauramacd.co.uk/roller-derby-photography/"&gt;Laura MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mind of a Building:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this point on you must think in a certain way. Think of the following metaphorically.
This starts with outlook and the words you use. It progresses with building on your foundation using metaphorical bricks. This ends with success &amp;amp; achievement. Each brick represents a new skill and/or success. Each brick is a new happiness. Once a brick has been laid, it is enduring, immovable and timeless. It is here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outlook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget the terms positive and negative. Nothing is negative. There is only learning &amp;amp; growing. All "negative" experiences are now lessons. "Every failure can only teach me. Every success will only make me grow and become more than I was". Adding "yet", changes everything. "I can't do that.....yet!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Forget the little feelings" - little feelings are the pieces of inner monologue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have that tells us, "we're tired, we can't be bothered, we can do it later". Identification of the little feelings is very hard. We as humans live by feelings that our body and mind perceive; hunger, thirst, pain, cold, warm, sadness, excitement etc. Our lives are dictated by our sensations. So learning to prioritise the essentials and ignore the non-essentials is key to keeping my mind as strong as a building.
Identify and don't listen to the little feelings. (Variable eliminated)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenario-ize:
Think of all the things that scare you with regards to your dream. List them. Think about all the things that can go wrong with regards to your goals. List them. Feelings of negativity &amp;amp; emotional turmoil arise happen...through shock of the unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we Scenario-ize. We go through the list of what we fear and what can go wrong;
Injury, defeat, abuse, pain, losing, ineffectiveness, anger - and we pretend internally that it has really happened. We go over the situation and tell ourselves how we want to behave/react.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If someone hits me illegally, i will keep my cool and keep on track with my team"
"If someone yells at me, i will not take it personally nor let it effect me"
"If someone does better than me, it doesn't mean I was in anyway bad. It only means I have more to do"
"If I foul out, I will respect the decision and not argue it. Then analyse my performance after I have supported my team and been respectful to those around me".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental preparation and practice, prevents poor performance and promotes positive prognosis. (Variables eliminated)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460021074061.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="wp-1460021074061" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460021074061.jpg" alt="image" width="1080" height="720"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Photo: &lt;a href="http://lauramacd.co.uk/roller-derby-photography/"&gt;Laura MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning &amp;amp; Growing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not if....but when these negative situations occur &amp;amp; you have successfully behaved how you planned, its time to learn.
Analyse. "What went wrong? Who's to blame? Why did it go wrong? How do I ensure this doesn't happen again". Ask these questions and learn from their answers. Let the learning fuel you to work hard to prevent this happening again. New variables will always arise and some old ones may come back. Scenario-ize these too and view them only as more lessons.
(Variable eliminated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little victories:
With every failure will come a few small or even tiny victories. Focus on them. When you are the underdog or out numbered with a high likelihood of failure, play for the little victories."We held that amazing jammer for 30sec"
"I got 1 lead jammer over someone far better than me"
"I finally used that thing i learnt at training and it worked"
"We were expected to lose by 100 and only lost by 50"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what happens, good or bad nothing will detriment me. Be prepared to lose but also get ready to win.
(Variable eliminated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mini victories are bricks too. The mind is built with stones of all sizes. For every achievement my wall gets bigger. For every success my building only grows.
Every brick makes my mind stronger. They are skills, they are happiness and they are esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 bricks forward, 1 brick back:
"Don't get too high".
Consider the idea of numeracy. We as humans love numbers. "I have £200. I lost 3kg. We won the last 2 games. I scored a 30point jam". Using this theme and if we  allocated points to our success bricks, we will start to accumulate points. If each brick represents 3 points we will eventually over the course of time build up a lot. Success breeds success. The more we achieve.....the more we achieve and the more we want to achieve. However, with success come a few poisonous characteristics that CAN cause our building to crumble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selfishness, arrogance, vanity &amp;amp; looking down on those considered weaker etc.
The points acquired are your points and for you to do as you want with them. So consider that if I use all 3 point to always climb high and feel better about myself,I may topple. "My ego was my down fall. My head got too big. He/she/they are amazing, but they are arrogant dicks". 2 to move up and one to step back..... and reflect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best heroes are the humble ones. "They were incredible &amp;amp; it was amazing how DOWN to earth they are". Be that hero and view the points as things to be rationed.
If I start at ZERO 0, my first success will give me 3 points with a potential score of 3. But! If i only use 2 and put 1 away for something else, i am still at 2 and still higher than I was at the beginning. Then over time, I will grow as my bricks add up. i will grow slower but, more stable. I will not get too high, I will NOT poison my wall with ego, arrogance and vanity &amp;amp; I will aim to be of use to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Variable eliminated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460021080516.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="wp-1460021080516" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/wp-1460021080516.jpg" alt="image" width="1120" height="720"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Photo: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/john.hesse.902"&gt;John Hesse&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing is caring : I grow, we grow:
"If you want to succeed quickly go alone. If you want to succeed forever, go together"
The effect you have on others is the most valuable currency there is. Life is built in teams. My family team. My relationship team. My work team. My friend team. My health team....my derby team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"2 points for me &amp;amp; 1 for you".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a metaphor, use 1 of those points that was for your growth that was stored away and give it to someone else. Use it to fuel their need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliments, praise, gifts, smiles, congratulations, feedback, encouragement. Be that humble hero and lift those up around you. Reflect on your needs, but also your teams needs. Recognise who could do with a boost emotionally. What do they need that your talent can provide? Succeed, Grow &amp;amp; Give back, as there may be someone in your Team that will need it more than you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final variable:
Mental strength is about control. Control of your own mind, thoughts, ideas and emotions. Mental strength is about controlling and eliminating variables that may be of detriment to your minds. 'The final &amp;amp; uncontrollable variable is other people'. Not everyone will have the same goals as you, or be as strong or as driven as you. Drive and strength are variable. There is nothing anyone can do to change that. We can only gently influence those who are involved in our journey to be as positive as we are. Set an example. "Monkey see. Monkey do"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Scenario-ize the reactions of other people. Pretend in your head the eventuality they will react negatively. Then plan what you can do to help them &amp;amp; prevent them being of detriment to themselves, to others and to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on:
○Avoiding the little feelings
○Their little victories
○Scenario-ize with them (prior)
○Share your defeats &amp;amp; successes together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Variable eliminated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Body &amp;amp; the Mind:
One will always effect the other. Neither is more or less important than the other but they both need the same due care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my body becomes stronger, I will perform better and grow the success bricks for my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my mind becomes stronger I will eliminate variables that would deter me to try new things in my skates or exercise my body more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Become balanced. Become more. Become awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One member of the Power of Scotland Team who has recently started her own fundraising endeavour is new Assistant Coach, &lt;strong&gt;Rosie Peacock&lt;/strong&gt;. As she's offering roller derby coaching, we caught up with her to talk a bit about her coaching experience, and what she's offering for those who may be interested. Rosie is also currently on &lt;a href="http://arrg.co.uk/teams/allstars/"&gt;Auld Reekie Roller Girls All-Stars&lt;/a&gt; roster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before we start talking about Power of Scotland specifically, we should start by spending a bit of time just to introduce you yourself...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm not sure there's a lot of time I could spend on it. I've been playing roller derby for 5 years; started off with Nottingham Hellfire Harlots. Just before Team England tryouts first time around, I had a knee operation, so I was out for that, which was gutting. Then coaching for probably the last 4 years; been all around the UK coaching on different levels - from professional through to National teams. There's not a lot interesting about me.
I like the fact that, in roller derby, you do not have to look like what society determines is an "athletic body" to be really good at this sport. And I like the fact that the fact that I've got really short stature and a really big arse and yet seem to be able to perform at a really high level, seems to give a lot of people quite a lot of hope.
&lt;p&gt;Also, I've been part of Team Metal Legs, which is for people who've been injured playing roller derby and forced to be off-skates for 3 months or more. We've done a lot of work, and that's just trying to build people's physical and mental confidence back up, after pretty traumatic breaks.
And that's been a lot of fun to do as well.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; And a lot of people seem to like you, too: you won the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/talkderby/"&gt;Talk Derby To Me&lt;/a&gt; [Podcast] "Personality" award for 2015.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Oh, yeah. [embarrassed chuckle] That's, that's, right…
So, I used to come up to Edinburgh a lot to visit, because I went to Uni here and it's where I met my husband, but then moved down to Nottingham, and then discovered roller derby. But I used to come back up, and when I did, I'd go and skate with my brother [Deathworm Jim], who used to skate for Capital City [Roller Derby]. (I'm still trying to persuade him to come back!)
&lt;p&gt;But I remember coming up for a scrim, and it was my first scrim back after my knee operation, and there was this massive guy, that looked like a Viking, looking quite nervous. [laughs] It was his first ever scrim. And that was, now Power of Scotland skater, Optimus Grime. I could just see so much potential in him, and rightly so, he's an incredible skater, puts in incredible hard work as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, he seems to be quite fond of me, which is really nice because it's nice to have someone who's that cool who's on your side.
He and Marryk [Talk Derby To Me co-host King Crazy] have been [inaudible] for quite a long time, we've announced together a few times, yeah, and I think because those guys… I think Grime nominated me and then Marryk's obviously quite fond of me too. (I don't know why! Maybe it's because I baked cookies for him one time!).
But [winning the award] was really amazing, actually, I had a little cry about that. Don't tell anyone, but yeah.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, coming back to Power of Scotland, you fairly recently became Assistant Coach. How has that experience been?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, due to life pressures happening for a couple of the other Power of Scotland guys, I'm now Assistant Coach, which is [long pause] &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;So, I get to see these guys progress, from tryouts to gelling as a team, and really starting to hone in on some of the tactics and bring it together as a unit. Because they're all, as individuals, enormously talented guys, but I think the key for these National teams is to get the team working together as a unit. These guys will all be the best skaters in their home leagues, and used to fulfilling certain roles within their home leagues, but within the Power of Scotland unit, you know, they very much need to learn to trust one another as a unit. Which is a challenge when you're used to being the guy who's maybe the last one, the last line of defence, or the jammer who doesn't need to take offence. When you're going to be playing Team USA, then you're going to be needing some offence!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's hard to emphasise how important this is for a National team in particular - "top dogs playing together", some of whom aren't domiciled in Scotland, who need to adjust to the different context.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Definitely. It's definitely a challenge. I think it's a big transition mentally, as well, for a lot of the guys, because, I mean, the guys who are based within Scottish leagues all know each other quite well. Scottish Roller Derby is quite a small community, although it's growing all the time, it's still concentrated relatively around Falkirk/Glasgow /Edinburgh/Dundee; Aberdeen being probably the furthest away of the Big Leagues that I'm aware of.
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, there's guys obviously eligible for tryouts from down in London, all kinds of leagues, and actually, those guys have gelled in really really well. It's really good - but I think it is a bit of a mindset change, because going from being possibly the best one or two guys in the league and being in a probably one-off-one-on kind of rotation to perhaps being in a one-in-three or whatever, that's a bit of an adjustment too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing personalities, the "superstars"?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, I love roller derby because, you can be a superstar but you will never be as good as four or five guys who are working together. And I tend to find that, overall, the superstar, or the, I guess not "superstars"  [because] for me, those are the guys who tend to be incredibly incredibly talented and skilled, but are also capable of being part of that unit. I guess the guys who are flashy, and do this stuff as an individual...
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ah, the glory hounds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;uhuh, uhuh. They get to a certain level of competition, and then they peter out. Because they find it difficult to put their desire to outperform their teammates, if they can't put that to one side, and use their skills to support their team and be part of that unit. Sometimes that means that you don't "look" very good, because you're the guy who's just standing in a wall, and everybody's like "what are you doing", but actually you're doing a really important job here! Those guys tend not to make it to this level of competition, I think purely because you know it's that, you can be the Stef Mainey of Roller Derby, but if you're not working as part of a team, the other four guys are gonna render you redundant.

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And of course, "The Stef Mainey" of Roller Derby is a very strong team player herself!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Exactly, exactly!
I think sometimes [teams say] "if someone's not good at doing this, we'll put them as a jammer, because jammers don't work together". But Jammers don't work on their own - you can't have effective team offence if the jammers aren't working with the rest of the team to make it happen. So, the days of "oh, it's okay that they have a massive ego, we'll just stick them onto jam", those are long gone!
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, you will be travelling to Calgary, the rest of the Team will be travelling to Calgary…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes! I haven't actually been able to pay for a ticket yet - I think because I stepped in relatively late on; I was part of the selection committee, but then took a step back, and it's only recently that I've stepped up into the Assistant Coach role. So I haven't actually had a chance to save any money, or plan, or prepare, at all. [laughs] So I am in a bit of a frantic frenzy of fundraising - not for myself, but for the Power of Scotland travel pot.
&lt;p&gt;The way that PoS are running it, is that there's an expectation that everyone will be doing something to fundraise, and if you've managed to raise £50 or £500 is irrelevant, it's about the effort that we're putting in as a team, to try and help one another with the cost of just getting over there and back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a bit late to the party, so I've got a bit of time to make up for that now!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power of Scotland are, themselves, offering Power of Scotland guest coaching as a fundraising approach (&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ayrshire-Roller-Derby-Official-618921518215712/"&gt;Ayrshire Roller Derby &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/DoonhameDerbyDolls/"&gt;Doonhame Derby Dolls&lt;/a&gt; both recently benefitted from this, for example). I guess that your coaching initiative is in addition to this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, I dunno, I'm like that jumper that you kind of only put on when you need something to put on, but it's still kinda comfy. [chuckles]
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know you don't like bigging yourself up too much, but we should say that you are a rather experienced coach!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Oh, my goodness. Okay, so , I guess, I can't even remember all of the leagues I've coached - and that sounds like I'm being an absolute dick but I honestly, I can't. But I've coached quite a lot around the Midlands; I've done a couple of bootcamps for some of the Northern English teams.
&lt;p&gt;Generally the newer teams starting out tend to be looking for guest coaches a lot more. Erm, because you can get to a certain level, with watching footage and coming up with stuff yourself, but then eventually you do want someone that's perhaps got a bit more experience to come and inject a few new ideas and kindof...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, recently we had [WFTDA #2 Ranked Victorian Roller Derby League's] Lorrae Adams &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/953866961316282/"&gt;come over to ARRG&lt;/a&gt;. My mind was blown, it was like: "wow, I can use my shoulders!" I guess I've never used my shoulders in Roller Derby because my hips are so much wider; every time I try and come in with a shoulder, it's a bit pointless - my bum's already there! But she really opened my eyes to a whole different array of ways to use my body to make people fall over, which was great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think, sometimes, passing that information on to other leagues, but in a way that works for them, is really crucial. I don't come in and just coach what I like to do! I ask the league what they're looking for, ask them if they've got any footage to get an idea of where they're at, and what the next steps for progress would be, and to make sure it's stuff that's going to work for them, drills they can take away and make their own, and develop. Rather than coming in and being all like "this is how I play roller derby, so everyone should play roller derby this way".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[For example], a lot of leagues will be doing different kinds of defensive wall now. In Scotland, people are predominantly, I think, using the braced three-wall with a sort of spare-guy. But perhaps elsewhere, you'll see a lot more of the cube-walls, and rotational walls, happening. So it's really important as a coach to understand and be able to coach all these things, whether your home league uses them or not.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So far you've talked about experiences with Women's derby, but we should say thay you've skated Coed with guys on track a lot too...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, I love Coed. I absolutely ... I would love if Coed had the same sort of competitive structure that WFTDA has. I actually think it's (don't tell anyone), I think it's a lot more &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; because you can really take advantage of the different body shapes and physicality of it all. I'm more of a thinky kind of skater, so rather than being particularly strong or particularly fast, I'll think about how to use somebody else's style as a way to knock them off balance, or control them, or frustrate them. I love Coed, because it's just something underestimated as an approach.
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, so I've done load of these kind of fun [events], like Last Action Hero, SciFight, just generally, if there's an opportunity to play any kind of high level Coed, I'll want to be there. We're defending our championship titles for SciFight this year as well, so that's Game On!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I guess it's inevitable that Coed experience involves lots of exhibition teams; there's not a lot of permanent teams (although that's changing, especially in Scotland!). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, so its understanding that, yes, there are differences in body dynamics that need to be accounted for [between men and women], but not overly focussed on. There used to be this thing of "well, girls block with their hips and boys block with their shoulders", and, although generally speaking men tend to have broader shoulders and their centre of gravity tends to be higher up, whereas women tend to have wider-set hips, and their weight tends to be lower down towards their hips level, that's absolutely not the absolute rule.
&lt;p&gt;There's loads of guys - there's a couple, [for example] Alan [Watt] in Power of Scotland who is an incredible blocker with his hips. And it really annoys me actually when people say "Oh, he blocks like a girl!", because, no, he blocks like an &lt;em&gt;incredible skater&lt;/em&gt;, gender has nothing to do with it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there's teammates that I've skated with that their shoulders are much broader than their hips, and they've got incredible power in their shoulders.
So, I would love it if it got to the stage where gender just didn't matter in roller derby. If it was "so, this is the team from [say] Manchester", and it's the team of the best skaters in Manchester, and how they identify in terms of their gender, or what their organs are, has no relevance. That's what I'd really like to see.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender policies and feelings about this are changing, though. For example, the UKRDA gender policy was an early leader in this kind of thing (before WFTDA themselves updated a bit).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;I really like the way MRDA is heading, in terms of "actually, you don't have to specify a gender, you just can't be a female skating on a female league, and also an MRDA member league".
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;They just need to drop the 'M' from MRDA…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah. I know that Mean City in Glasgow have taken quite a lot of positive steps in terms of starting off as a Men's League, I guess in answer to the fact that there was only a female league set up at the time [Glasgow Roller Derby]. And now they've got to the stage where they're "actually, we don't care how you identify, we want you to come and skate with us, we want you to be the best you can be". And I really like that.
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and a lot of the newer leagues in Scotland are defaulting to Coed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, and I guess in terms of the higher ranked teams, there's going to be that decision in terms of well, in terms of Rankings, a lot of it is done in terms of the WFTDA, which does have a more stringent gender policy, whether you agree with it or not, so it's "Women's Flat Track Roller Derby", and that is currently the primary Ranking System for the top level teams.
&lt;p&gt;So, it's like "wouldn't it be nice if we could see WFTDA and MRDA merge to 'RDA', and [have] that ranking system take off, and make that conscious decision to stop caring about gender, in terms of athletic ability".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying gender's not important to people on an individual basis - of course it is - but in terms of having an impact on someone's ability to perform in a sport, I think it's absolutely irrelevant.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sure, I think there's probably still sports where there's a genuine gender gap (powerlifting, for example), although they do tend to be narrowing over time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, and I think [in roller derby], the wheels are the great equaliser. You can be as big and strong as you like, but someone half your weight and a slip of a thing can out-manoeuvre you, and you're done.
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And you get lighter guys too, it's not just "Big Men versus Small Women". Jim Whyte, on PoS, is a pretty lightly built guy, but he does great things on track.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, and he's a fantastic blocker. I know he does a lot of jamming, because he is so incredibly skilled on his feet, but you know, I've made the mistake in games of thinking, "ahh, weight ratios, I'll take him on his chest, it'll be fine!" And it's not fine! He's really good at assessing the angle that someone's coming in at, and counter-leaning really well.
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This seems like a good place to start wrapping up; is there anything you'd like to particularly emphasise to the readers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;So, yes, I'm just really keen to get out and.. I've taken a little bit of a break from coaching, because of the move from Nottingham up to Edinburgh, and that's taken a bit of a transition, and I've been kind of focussing on getting used to the way that things are done at ARRG, because on joining any new league there's a transition experience in terms of tactics and things. But, yeah, I just really miss coaching, I would really like to get out, try and spread the Derby Love to some other teams.
&lt;p&gt;There's quite a lot of weekends between now, and July 20th, which is when we fly out, some of them are already pretty fully booked, but there's lots of weekends free.
And I'm doing quite a lot of travelling anyway, so hopefully, I can book things in when I'm already in the local area.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You could even try to get in some coaching when you're over at the Big O with Auld Reekie!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, ARRG are in as one of the lowest (WFTDA) ranked teams in the tournament, so that's going to be an amazing challenge. I can't see Rose City saying, "Hey, come over any coach us!". [laughs] That would be amazing, but no.
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Sure, but there's tons of smaller leagues in the USA too. Just like US skaters have basically just heard of London Rollergirls; skaters in the UK only hear about the big leagues in the USA. You don't see the smaller, just as interesting, leagues from the distance...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rosie: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, yeah, I hadn't thought of it that way!
