&lt;p&gt;Technically LeedsRD were new to Champs this time around, as this is their first year of competition. However, being formed from the merger of Leeds Roller Dolls and Hot Wheel Roller Derby, they have a lot of experienced skaters, and inherited LRD's position in Tier 1. The team were only just formed at the time of their first Champs games (and they are only just at the point of getting a new logo now), so this was always going to be a difficult competitive year for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-23291" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/08/20642312_1417657074969467_922557361_o.jpg?w=1024" alt="20642312_1417657074969467_922557361_o" width="1024" height="683"&gt; Leeds Roller Derby v Birmingham Blitz Dames Credit: Tallboy Images&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final fixture for the Tier 1 comes in a few weeks, on the 26th August, as LeedsRD face London Brawl Saints, as do Birmingham Blitz Dames; whilst Bristol Roller Derby take on the season's likely champions, Middlesbrough Roller Derby. Sadly, the adjustments needed within LeedsRD have left them at the bottom of the table to date, but the team is positive about their rate of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked to Leeds Roller Derby's A team co-captains, Nina and Lana Del Slay about their experience, and the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has Champs been for you?&lt;/strong&gt;
Nina: It's been brilliant! As a brand new team we knew that tier 1 was going to be tough, and it has been, but we've loved it. Our first game against Tiger Bay was on 26 February - less than 8 weeks after our first ever training session as Leeds Roller Derby - and we had some key skaters out with big injuries early on. Of course it would have been amazing to have gone out there and smashed it but these are some of the best and most established teams in the country and that just wasn't going to happen - we were under no illusions about that.
Lana: Back in February we said that our number one goal for the season was becoming a team, and we're really happy with how far we've come in just eight months. We've just announced our latest charter which we'll be choosing a roster for the Brawl Saints game from. We've played a few different skaters and there are a couple of new faces on this charter too. There's more and more competition for spots on the A team but also our B team too. It's exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What plans do you have post-Champs?&lt;/strong&gt;
Nina: Our B team is playing Croydon away in September, which we're looking forward to...
Lana: We're going to be celebrating 10 years of roller derby in Leeds in October which is a very big focus for us. There will be lots of events taking place to mark it, including the return of the Great Yorkshire Showdown, and we'll be unveiling our rebrand which we've all been working really hard on then too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23301" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/08/20615803_1417455691656272_79860269650687366_o.jpg" alt="20615803_1417455691656272_79860269650687366_o" width="1100" height="1100"&gt; The new LeedsRD A Team Roster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tier 1 Final: &lt;strong&gt;26 August&lt;/strong&gt;, Birmingham &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1444426895600235/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/1444426895600235/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Our team for Tier 2 North was &lt;a href="http://www.newcastlerollergirls.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newcastle Roller Girls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;' B-team, the Whippin Hinnies, who were one of three 3 B-teams added to British Champs this year. (London Rollergirls had led the charge the previous year, with the Brawl Saints competing in Tier 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-13711 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/01/newcastlerg_1.png" alt="newcastlerg_1" width="122" height="250"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend sees the final fixture in the Division, with Newcastle up against Wirral Roller Derby in &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/104769700121799/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manchester&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. With the Hinnies at the bottom spot currently, with Wirral just one place above them, this should be the closest bout of the tournament for them - SRDRank places them nigh-identically in ranking, whist FTS favours Wirral, but not much. At the top of the table, the other B team in the Division, Rainy City B (the Tender Hooligans) have a tight grip on the top spot, with Liverpool Roller Birds and hosts Manchester Roller Derby fighting it out for the second playoffs spot in the same event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked to Hinnies' Co-Captain, Ania Marx about their first Champs experience...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's been a tough Tier for the Hinnies' first Champs experience, so far, with teams like Rainy B in the mix. How has the experience been for the team - and what has it taught you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a challenge ​but we​ always​ knew it would be - being seeded last​ in our Tier against alongside some really strong teams​ and also being a B team​ means that we've also​ needed to absorb a number of charter changes as players move up to our A team​, the Canny Belters​​​,​​ but we're grateful for the opportunity to play at this level - we've learnt a lot and have thoroughly enjoyed the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With just one game left in the season, what are your plans for the post-Champs period...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll have a short break from ​competitive bouts but hope to fit in a few more before the end of the year - we'll update the fixtures page on our website as soon as we've got more games confirmed. Immediately after our last Champs game on the 5th Aug we​'ll definitely be let​ting​ our hair down and enjoy​ing​ the after party and hope all the other leagues will be doing the same​!​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...and your thoughts about Champs next year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a great opportunity for the Whippin' ​Hinnies which was only possible due to our A team​'​s ​WFTDA ranking and our own European ranking​ going into Champs​ - if we remain eligible​ as a B team​ we will seriously consider​ taking part​ next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As hinted at in the interview, whilst the Hinnies will be taking a break post-Champs, there's more happening with Newcastle in the coming months.
We'd keep our eyes peeled for an away game in August, as well as the return of the Hinnies (and the Canny Belters) later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Champs Tier 2 North final fixture: &lt;strong&gt;5 August&lt;/strong&gt;, Manchester &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/104769700121799/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/104769700121799/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>british champs</category><category>british roller derby championships</category><category>interviews</category><category>newcastle roller girls</category><category>whippin hinnies</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/08/01/newcastles-whippin-hinnies-update-british-champs-t2-and-beyond/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2017 12:44:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Granite City Roller Derby update: British Champs T3 and beyond</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/07/22/granite-city-roller-derby-update-british-champs-t3-and-beyond/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been a little remiss with our &lt;a href="https://www.britishchamps.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;British Champs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Northern Divisions updates since the middle of the season, so we're back a with a special catchup with our teams from each Tier, continuing with Tier 3's Granite City Roller Derby!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-22709" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/07/gcrd.png?w=300" alt="GCRD" width="300" height="300"&gt; GCRD!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granite City's Northern Fights had an exceptional 2016 in Champs, entering Tier 3 in 2017 by promotion after topping the table. They've continued their excellent Champs performance in Tier 3 - they currently top the table here as well, unbeaten, with extremely strong victories in 3 of 4 of their games so far. (The only close game was their first, against Halifax's Bruising Banditas.)
The rest of the Tier 3 Champs table is more even at the moment with, tentatively, Auld Reekie's Reserves and the newly-rebranded North Wales Roller Derby in the most likely places to take the second top spot. We'll know more after the second-last fixtures of the Tier, today, hosted by North Wales, with the final bouts happening August in Edinburgh as Auld Reekie host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northern Fights co-Captain, Berocca Bama had the following to say: "2017 Tier 3 North has been a very exciting and challenging time for the Northern Fights of GCRD. As a result of hard training and solid dedication of the players and league, we have really grown and bonded as a team since Tier 4 in 2016 which meant we felt strong to compete in Tier 3 North 2017 and the results so far are far beyond our wildest dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had so many enjoyable games, the most thrilling of which was against ARRG B. The team that ended our winning streak in 2016, we knew ARRG were going to be really tough opponents. We are sure anyone who was there to see this Champs game would agree it was a nail biter to the end!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking forward to playing the Furness Firecrackers in the final Champs game in August; we know they'll bring it! It's a very important game for us, as a victory here should see us through to play-offs, if our maths is right..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granite City are also hosting events outside of Champs, starting with their very own tournament in a weeks time, the &lt;strong&gt;29th&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;July&lt;/strong&gt;! &lt;strong&gt;Scottish Sevens&lt;/strong&gt; will be the most heptamerous of Sevens tournaments, with seven co-ed/OTA teams competing, each with the traditional seven skaters, in 21 minute games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after Champs Tier 3 North comes to an end in August (except for the Tier 3 promotion playoffs, 16/17 September), the Northern Fights will be hosting 2 games of their own, up in Aberdeen. These will also be great opportunities to see GCRD's B team, the Fight Hawks, as both events are double headers!
We don't have dates for these events yet, but of course we will feature them as soon as we have more information...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22663" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/07/10858530_804241242955870_3874820604520383031_n.jpg" alt="10858530_804241242955870_3874820604520383031_n" width="462" height="527"&gt; York Minxters Logo (Credit: York Minxters)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the season is closing out, the Minxters will be playing their last bout of their Division of the Tier on &lt;strong&gt;July 29th&lt;/strong&gt;. With three teams in the Division all with a single win (York, Grimsby and Durham Roller Derby), this bout will play an important part in deciding the final table ordering. Hosts Durham Roller Derby will play their fellow Durhamites, Durham City Rolling Angels, in the other decisive bout in the fixture (Wakey Wheeled Cats play Mansfield in the third bout... but Wakefield can't be knocked off the top spot according to the Champs table - and &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; teams will be promoted to Tier 3 regardless, as they have an unassailable grip on the top 2 places).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minxters Captain Gem O'Cide is excited about the bout, "Our final Champs game on July 29th is a triple header. We take on our lovely friends Grimsby and its a game we have been looking forward to - it's d always hard to hit the ones you love.. and I think war paint will be caked on so we can ignore the smiles... as a team we have decided on a theme.. AND we don't do things by halves!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the rest of the team will be celebrating surviving their first ever tournament series the day after, &lt;strong&gt;July 30th&lt;/strong&gt;, with a closed, mixed scrim for skaters from all the teams in Tier 4 North, as well as other "Tier 4 level" teams.
The Minxters describe it as a "celebration of everything we've achieved competing in our first championships", "a super casual affair full of fun and welcoming newer skaters, refs and officials to mark the end of champs and the start of the next season".
Any skaters of the right level who are interested in joining in should do so quickly, as the event is almost at capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After recovering from this, the celebrations won't stop for York Minxters: a month later, August 20th, they'll be giving fans the chance to see the rising stars of the next season, as their last fresh meat intake hold their debut exhibition bout... as well as a "meet and greet" after the bout, for those interested in signing up themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An open-subscription bout for all rookie skaters, this has proven so popular that skater tickets sold out in just 3 days - although there is a reserve list for those still interested. The team are still looking for a full officiating crew, so Referees and NSOs are welcomed!
Gem O'Cide adds, "The theme is Disney vs Superhero* and we sold out much faster than we expected -  which we are super happy with; we're already planning part two! The current rostered skaters have a chance to bench and NSO to thank all the intake for all their hard work over the last 6 months.
These are just our first planned off-season scrims.. there will be much more from the Minxters in the rest of 2017!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first round of the tier took place in Dublin during the Easter weekend and saw GMRD take a win over Teeside 234 to 167, whilst a depleted Skelpies team were beaten by Men Behaving Derby 235 to 131.  Those results left GMRD and Men Behaving derby Joint top on points, but Men Behaving Derby top thanks to score difference.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately for BCR's Skelpies, they have picked up a few more injuries at their first game. This has left them with an even smaller roster than they had in Dublin; due to this they have decided to forfeit their game with GMRD, awarding GMRD the win.
&lt;p&gt;However, BCR will be drafting in a few guests to fill in the gaps in their squad thus allowing a game to be played and the event to remain a double header. The game will not count towards Champs, of course, but will still be great derby!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teeside vs Men Behaving Derby will be a great fight. Teeside will be looking to to get their first points on the board, whilst Men Behaving Derby will be looking to take another win to consolidate their place at the top of the table.&lt;/p&gt;
