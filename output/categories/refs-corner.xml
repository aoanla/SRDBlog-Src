On the &lt;strong&gt;3rd of April&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Manhattan Works, Dundee, &lt;/strong&gt;DRG officials are opening their doors at &lt;strong&gt;7pm &lt;/strong&gt;for a three hour bootcamp, all for a &lt;strong&gt;fiver!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-15994" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/03/13517416_1130444287020985_6335893209574319226_o.jpg?w=1024" alt="Courtesy: DRG" width="1024" height="768"&gt; Obligatory after bootcamp photo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year saw three instalments of this officials orientated bootcamp, inviting NSO's, Referees and anyone that wanted to expand their rules knowledge to DRG's Manhattan Works venue in Dundee. Not only do they offer the chance to learn from some of the most experienced referees in Scotland but also to try out the tiled sports court that is so common across the US derby scene!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their previous &lt;em&gt;Late n' Lite&lt;/em&gt;'&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; have covered a variety of topics to help veteran and new officials alike! The first, in 2016, covered “&lt;em&gt;Oddly phrased Skater Queries”&lt;/em&gt; and “&lt;em&gt;Official Reviews&lt;/em&gt;”; the second: “&lt;em&gt;OPR like a Pro&lt;/em&gt;” and “&lt;em&gt;Positive Self Talk!&lt;/em&gt;”; with the third covering “&lt;em&gt;Defusing Difficult Situations&lt;/em&gt;” and “&lt;em&gt;Level up your JR and OPR positioning&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids="16013,16012,16014" type="rectangular"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each mini-bootcamp consists of two 45 minute off-skate sessions, usually one broad subject is covered initially and then another role-specific focus is brought out. After which, on skates referees are given the chance to put these new skills to the test by refereeing the Dundee Roller Girls skaters in a final hour scrim!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn a bit more about the reasoning behind these bootcamps, and just have a wee catch up with some of Scotland's referees, we had a wee chat with &lt;strong&gt;Ruby RaGe (R) &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; Tiny Tearaway (T)&lt;/strong&gt; (head officials for DRG 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids="16028,16027" type="circle" columns="2"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; So to start us off, how did these bootcamps come around? Was it something that DRG officials were working on for a long time?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;R: &lt;/b&gt;I guess we started having a chat amongst the group and Righteous Oxide came up with the idea!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;T:&lt;/b&gt; I wasn’t actually part of the league when the bootcamps were first talked about. I think it was commented on that there wasn’t anything like this already in Scotland and it would be a good idea to look into it. A few months later the first bootcamp popped up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Q: There's quite a lot of you DRG officials isn't there? Do you all take it in turns for leading a session or how is it all planned?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; What tends to happen is that folks volunteer to take a session. When it comes to the ‘classroom’ stuff it’s not everyone’s bag to stand up in front of a room full of people. I think the great thing is we all bring something different to the table. This makes it really varied and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; All of the officials at DRG have their own amazing skillsets. We have a wee chat about topics for a bootcamp and usually someone volunteers to take a session on a specific subject. I was really excited to do my session on jam reffing as I can get quite passionate about it and want all the refs to love it as much as I do &lt;span style="font-family:Wingdings;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What's planned for your fourth installment then?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; Ahhh, I’m not part of the planning for this one, I'll let Tiny take this question..!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; The fourth bootcamp is probably going to be the most exciting. So far we have focused mainly on skating officials but with so many people at DRG and across all of the Scottish leagues taking an interest in the non skating side of things, we decided to make the bootcamp for skating officials as well as anyone wanting to delve into the wonderful world of nso’ing. We are delighted that the very talented &lt;em&gt;Peggy Kreugar&lt;/em&gt; from ARRG has agreed to take this session. After the theory side of things all of the officials get the chance to ref and NSO a scrim with the lovely skaters from DRG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you feel running bootcamps like these impacts the movement of Scottish Officials? Especially when specific focus is being put into our lovely NSOs?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; I think what our league is offering is very special. It’s fair to say that NSO’s are sometimes overlooked and we very much feel they are part of the big picture. Nurturing on &amp;amp; off skates officials is integral to the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; It is a bit of a laugh between the Scottish officials that DRG have all the refs in Scotland. This isn’t quite true but we are very lucky to have 10 referees who ref at different levels throughout Scotland, the rest of the uk and the rest of the world. We are a league who have an open door policy when it comes to helping anyone who wants to learn how to ref or nso. We saw the bootcamps as a way to help newer officials and newer leagues with fewer refs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there any major barriers you feel for Scottish Officials breaking through into officiating outside of bonnie Scotland or even into international derby?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; I think you have to get yourself known &amp;amp; put yourself out there. It will get harder as the pool of Officials increases but it’s good to have contacts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt;The Scottish officials are a very close community. We are always happy to help each other out and because of this I think we have built a reputation of being knowledgeable, fair and reliable. I think for a lot of newer officials it is quite daunting to start applying to events and games over the border and abroad. The advice I was given was apply to everything, get your name out there and get known. If you get rejected, although it sucks at the time there will always be more opportunities. Work hard, ask for help and be the best you can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; To finish off, do you guys wanna give us some hints to the next few bootcamps? What are your main goals for these?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; Well there will be lots of OPR training from our wonderful&lt;em&gt; Shuggs Bunny&lt;/em&gt; and of course some great insight into Jam ref’ing like a true super star from Tiny. I’ve done some of the more mental rather than physical aspects of Derby in the past (positive self-talk) and would love to do something similar again this year. We just love the fact that lots of Officials are prepared to travel some distance to attend these Boot Camps. I think we must be doing something right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, just what Rubes has said, having the next few bootcamps continuing along the same path. Looking at focused and specific learning, but at the same time making sure there is a bit of something to keep everyone interested. It is great to see that other leagues such as &lt;em&gt;Glasgow Roller Derby&lt;/em&gt; are offering more officiating events, aimed more at nso’s but also welcome refs. I think if leagues continue with these bootcamps and training sessions the future of Scottish officiating can only become stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want to polish up your NSO skills, OPR like a PRO and have some scrim time practice then DRG's Late n' Lite Bootcamp is for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doors open at&lt;strong&gt; 7pm&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Manhattan Works, Dundee.

In this Article Go-Go-Gadget-Skates and Buffy Boiler will look at the implications from the perspective of a skater and a referee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Buffy: First of all, I'd like to address what the new minimum skills actually mean for non-WFTDA leagues. Basically, they are as big a deal as your league wants them to be. The first page of the document has some interesting stuff to say that I think a lot of people are forgetting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The minimum skills are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;- Required for charter team skaters playing WFTDA sanctioned games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;- Strongly recommended for skaters playing in interleague scrimmage or games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;- Strongly recommended for skaters playing in intraleague (home) scrimmages or games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;- Recommended for new skaters to graduate to contact drills and intraleague (home league) scrimmages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What this means is that if you're a new league or for whatever reason just don't yet have a sufficient number of skaters to field a team who all meet the new minimums you can still scrimmage, and even bout, as long as you agree it in advance with any prospective opponents.  The goal of this update is not to turn Derby into a game for only elite-level skaters, but it is definitely a move to ensure that WFTDA tournaments and games between WFTDA members represent a good standard of play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I do expect that in the near future the new minimums will become the standard for interleague competition, as more and more teams are able to meet them - but remember that as the standard of play rises so will the standard of coaching available. The way up for a new league hasn't suddenly become longer, but it does maybe need a little more thought now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Gadget: So early April saw the release of the updated WFTDA Minimum skills assessment to a very mixed review from my fellow skaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;First and foremost, I’d like to echo what Buffy has so rightly pointed out, these minimums are only compulsory for WFTDA leagues! Of course they are strongly recommended for all others. If a league plays under the WFTDA ruleset, it would make sense for that same league to start updating their minimum skills for the league as a whole, whether WFTDA or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Buffy: The old minimums were built primarily with safety in mind; though I think it's fair to say that was never their sole purpose. For instance 25 in 5 was not a safety requirement, but it helped ensure a base standard of athletic ability which was necessary for competitive play. Just as 27 in 5 represents the increase in the general athleticism of the sport today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Gadget: Lets look at what’s been added and taken away. We see the addition and subtraction of various skills. Like so many other skaters, I am glad to see the back of the unnecessary baseball slide fall. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone use this fall in active gameplay. The new minimums focus very much on specific skills that, if you were brought up on the old minimums, you very quickly learned you needed to succeed in the game. As well as skill, it is upping the expectation of speed from the skaters, with the addition of 27 in 5 and being able to complete one lap in 13 seconds from standstill. Other skills that have been introduced are reverse crossovers, transitions. A lot of the minimums now have clearer descriptions on what is expected, thus making it far easier for leagues to interpret and teach to their aspiring future derby players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Buffy: Derby is no longer simply a game about skating fast and turning left. The sport has evolved in ways few people could have anticipated in 2009, when the minimums were last updated, and as a result the modern game changes pace and even direction very quickly. So I think it's right that things like transitions are now seen as part of the core skill-set. As many of us will have seen, a poorly executed transition can lead to serious injury. Putting too much torque on the ankles can lead to anything from strains and sprains to spiral fractures (where the bone is broken by twisting it, not snapping - which almost always requires surgery). To say nothing of the obvious risks to suddenly changing direction and falling in front of other skaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This aside, the bulk of the minimums have actually been streamlined - the section on "sticky skating" (or skullcrushing as some called it) has been condensed to one line: "Propels self while keeping all 8 wheels on the floor." Skaters now simply have to be able to competently land legal hip and body checks while skating at a decent speed. It's less about box ticking and more about ensuring that people are comfortable and, most importantly, safe on skates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Gadget: Personally, at first I was disheartened at seeing the addition of 27 in 5, particularly because I remember how long it took me to achieve in the first place then again when returning from injury. However after some reflection, I think it’s a great addition. Having 25 in 5 before wasn’t really that good of an indication of a skaters endurance. Yes they can skate fast for 5 minutes, but could they skate fast for multiple jams in a row? Most of a period? A game? Unfortunately for some skaters, the answers to these questions are no. I also feel that new and old skaters alike will benefit greatly from the inclusion of these skills, making them better, more skilled derby players in the long run. I love that I can transition, not particularly fast, but I can. And I look forward to the day that I do this on track without having to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Buffy It's probably been apparent that I'm all for this change, especially as the WFTDA have been careful to be inclusive in their approach. They are not saying you must be able to skate this well to play, they are simply saying that this is the standard expected in their own competitions. I've seen skaters who could technically pass their minimums thrown into bouts well before they were ready, this is disheartening for the person concerned - it's easy to keep a nice strong stance when you're asked to do so for a minute or two in order to be assessed on it, it's quite another to be able to maintain it while keeping up with a fast pack and trying to not be taken out by an opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a referee I technically do not need to be able to pass minimum skills, the required standard of skating for referees is entirely up to the leagues they train with. Most leagues will use the minimums for skaters as the basis for referee training, and there will be a level that each league expects before allowing a new official to start refereeing scrimmages and then later bouts. Personally, I'm an advocate of strong skating skills for referees. We need to be fast at OPR and able to quickly change pace to follow the skaters from the inside, this is particularly true of Jam Refs. We also all need to be confident enough to do all this without thinking about what our skates are doing, while making decisions which can drastically alter the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Buffy: The old minimum skills really were the minimum required. Some may find it disheartening to hear this but very few established skaters were struggling with any of the old skills. A skater who can pass these is actually pretty good, not merely safe to share a track with. This means that when new skaters do pass, they'll know that they're at a higher standard than the generation of skaters before them was when they first took to the track. Our sport is evolving and improving, which I think we can all agree is a very good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Gadget: Yes it will take time to be able to do all of these skills. Chances are, you can probably achieve most of them, if not all already. Don’t be disheartened if you can’t. Everyone else had to learn and you can too. You need to work hard, the same as you did for your original minimums. Your league will thank you for it as you will become a better skater who is more agile, fast and overall more skilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;My final thought is that I’d like to echo what Buffy has said, these new skills will make new skaters joining bouting ranks more equipped to deal with the state of play that is now happening at scrimmages and bouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
