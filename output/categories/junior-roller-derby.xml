As always, we’re using &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"&gt;Flat Track Stats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/"&gt;Derby Listing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html"&gt;SRD Rank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). (SRDRank also has recent WFTDA rankings, including the 31st June ranking, as well as SRDRank, and allows you to make predictions from them.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
We're trying a new colour coding this week, to differentiate &lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;BOUTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;span style="color:#0000ff;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RECRUITMENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="color:#993300;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;OPEN SCRIM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;s, and &lt;span style="color:#008000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOOTCAMP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;s.

Not only has it featured the 3rd Roller Derby World Cup itself, in Manchester; and the 3rd Men's Roller Derby World Cup, in Barcelona... but it will also see the first truly international &lt;a href="https://www.juniorrollerderby.org/2018champsandwc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Junior Roller Derby World Cup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as JRDA extends its Championships to include an National Teams tournament, including European representation for the first time..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great Britain will be one of 6 National or Quasi-national teams competing in the event, taking on Europe (also debuting), and the returning Teams of Canada, Australia, USA East and USA West for the JRDA World Cup Trophy, between &lt;strong&gt;23rd&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;24th July&lt;/strong&gt; (the two days following JRDA Champs), in Philadelphia, PA, USA!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll recognise some of the skaters involved in Team GB from the Roller Derby World Cup's Junior Roller Derby exhibition bout (and some of the others in that exhibition are in Team Europe, competing against them!); in fact, Team GB and Team Europe's mastermind, Phil Rutter, was responsible for organising that as well! (He's also the JRDA "European Regional Coordinator".)
Team GB Juniors has a host of other talent behind it, however: Head Coach, Toots, is a long established member of Lincolnshire Rolling Thunder + England Men's Roller Derby; also repeat members of England Men's are two support Coaches, Reaper (also of Southern Discomfort), and Tom-A-Hawk (also of Lincolnshire Rolling Thunder); the third support coach being England Roller Derby and London Roller Girls' equally skilled and experienced Beth Lord.
Beyond the coaches, there's a huge organising committee you can see &lt;a href="https://teamgbjuniorrollerderby.org/organisers/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough about the adults, though, you'll want to see the actual skaters! If you've missed the announcements, then here they are:
&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-26763 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/05/collage-finished.jpeg" alt="collage-finished" width="712" height="712"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a National team is expensive - and it's especially expensive when you have to fly intercontinentally, and even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; so when you're a Junior team (and thus need adults around for legal reasons too) - costs for Team GB Juniors will be at least £20000 overall...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, &lt;a href="https://teamgbjuniorrollerderby.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team GB Junior Roller Derby&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have been raising funds for some time - supported by some excellent teams across the UK in providing events! This way, you can both support the UK's Junior Roller Derby community, and also experience awesome Derby too...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up: Peterborough's Borderland Brawlers Roller Derby host a double header (2 June 2018), combining some all-gender roller derby with the best of UK junior derby.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 June 2018, Peterborough: [&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/431804163914209/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
If you'd like to learn something as well, Team GB Juniors also have you covered, as Rainy City Roller Derby are generously providing the Thunderdome to them to host a combined adult/junior bootcamp!

&lt;p&gt;Fierce Valley Roller Cubs was the first junior roller derby league in Scotland, and began training in September 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>fierce valley roller cubs</category><category>fvrc</category><category>junior roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/04/04/fierce-valley-roller-cubs-needs-you/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2017 10:47:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>2016 in Review</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/12/31/2016-in-review/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst on a general level, 2016 has been labelled a bad year (perhaps unfairly - it's been a mixed bag, it's just that the negatives have been big and prominent, and the positives less so), for Roller Derby, in Scotland and World wide, it's been pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're capping off the year by talking about the things that happened in the past 12 months, first in Scotland (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/12/31/2016-in-review/1"&gt;page 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) and secondly across the World (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/12/31/2016-in-review/2"&gt;page 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), before rounding up our hopes for 2017 (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/12/31/2016-in-review/3"&gt;page 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Scotland&lt;/h3&gt;
Scottish Roller Derby continued to Grow: several new leagues popped up, which we recently brought to you [&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/11/06/scotlands-newest-coed-league-inverclyde-roller-derby/"&gt;Inverclyde Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/12/13/scotlands-newest-northernmost-league-orkney-viqueens/"&gt;Orkney ViQueens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/12/15/west-lothians-newest-league-west-lothian-roller-derby/"&gt;West Lothian Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/12/09/glasgow-mens-roller-derby/"&gt;Glasgow Men's Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/10/30/glasgows-new-inclusive-junior-derby-resistance-roller-derby/"&gt;Resistance Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;] and others continued to grow.
Ayrshire Roller Derby had their &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/08/16/ayshire-roller-derby-hit-the-track/"&gt;first public bout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (against Lothian Derby Dolls) as did &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/11/12/granite-city-brawlers-debut-home-game/"&gt;Granite City Brawlers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and GMRD, and Helgin Roller Derby  and the renewed Fair City Rollers have scheduled their (joint) first bout for next year (if we were to bet, we'd expect Doonhame Roller Derby to be the next to be bout-ready).
Scotland's only bouting junior derby team, Fierce Valley Roller Cubs, also played their &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/10/07/cubs-take-on-new-opposition/"&gt;first ever interleague bout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, against a mixed team from Sheffield and Newcastle.
Even the larger leagues continued to expand, with Auld Reekie Roller Girls' ASTROs founded this year, and taking the number of ARRG travel teams to 3. As our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/12/19/yearrgly-review-2016/"&gt;Auld Reekie review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; shows, the whole league had a pretty good year, with the All-Stars qualifying for WFTDA Division 2 playoffs (after an impressive performance at The Big O in the USA), and sensibly declining in favour of working on longer term goals.
&lt;p&gt;Further north, both Dundee Roller Girls and Granite City Roller Derby had very good years as well. Both leagues' A-teams performed impressively in their Divisions at British Champs (Granite City qualifying for promotion to Tier 3 from Tier 4, and Dundee just missing out on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/05/17/british-champs-at-dundee/"&gt;the promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to Tier 2 at the Tier-3 playoffs). Whilst Dundee has withdrawn from Champs to focus on their national and international game (especially after playing their &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/12/08/dundees-international-debut/"&gt;first international away&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, in Tenerife, just scant weeks ago), Granite City will indeed be in Tier 3 of Champs next year, alongside Auld Reekie's Reserves! The two leagues' B-teams also had very good years, with Dundee's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/11/16/a-chat-with-bonnie-colliders-captains-khilleesi-and-g-wrecks/"&gt;Bonnie Colliders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; winning basically every bout they played until ARRG's ASTROs late in the year, and GCRD's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/11/21/granite-citys-hawks-flock-to-the-arrgmageddon/"&gt;Fight Hawks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; playing three times as much derby as they did in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Central Belt, Bairn City Rollers' Skelpies managed a few bouts, despite many of them also making Power of Scotland, which prevented them taking fixtures in the first half of the year!. Alongside GMRD, they'll be joining the British Champs Men's T3 in 2017, and we expect good things of them. Meanwhile, BCR's &lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/12/12/bairn-city-belters-captain-and-vice-interview-2016/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central Belters&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;continued their own upward rise in the rankings - a win against the newly-reformed Furness Firecrackers sealing that trend for the year, and setting the Belters the challenge of maintaining expectations in 2017 (the problem with upward growth is that people start expecting it to never stop!). The open-gender Belter Skelpers had a much quieter year, taking on just Mean City's coed-team and then hosting Granite City Brawlers and friends for BCR's 4th Anniversary event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Mean City, they were also extremely busy this year, hosting a vast range of events, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/05/24/powers-of-two-at-mean-city/"&gt;double-headers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; supporting Power of Scotland. With the growth of coed leagues in Scotland (several of our newer non-bouting leagues are open), hopefully Mean City will have an even busier year next year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the Scottish Men's National Team, Power of Scotland also had a very big year, representing well at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/07/30/mrdwc2016-rankings-and-statistics/"&gt;Men's Roller Derby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in Calgary, placing a creditable 10th, just below the tournament's surprise unseeded upset of Mexico. Several members of the 2016 team are also now involved with Team Scotland Roller Derby, who will be hoping (along with PoS) to represent the nation strongly in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not to say that there weren't some wobbles in Scottish Derby: due to an unfortunate series of retirements, Glasgow Roller Derby has spent the season with a very different roster to 2015, resulting in the 2015 British Champs Champions placing near the bottom of the Premier Division in 2016.  They'll be aiming to pull back their WFTDA ranking position over 2017... although they've retired from British Champs to focus their team on this goal.   Similarly, a series of transfers and other movements lead to Fierce Valley Roller Girls performing less well than they would have liked in the Champs Tier 3, resulting in potential relegation to Tier 4 in 2017. (Despite this, both FVRG and GRD have been drivers of many Scottish events in the past year - Fierce Valley hosting a pair of massive &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/10/18/the-team-who-sur5ed-fierce-valley-host-harry-potter-themed-open-event/"&gt;Sur5al&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tournaments and hosting an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/03/23/international-roller-derby-in-the-forth-valley/"&gt;international&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; against Zurich, and Glasgow hosting &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/11/28/glasgow-roller-derby-close-the-year-with-festive-charity/"&gt;Charity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; events and playing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/03/01/glasgow-at-europes-first-wftda-division-1-tournament/"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/10/25/glasgow-cross-the-irish-sea-dublin-v-irn-bruisers/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Europe themselves, as well as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/03/29/international-derby-at-glasgow-and-edinburgh/"&gt;hosting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Berlin, and playing a big part in Vagine Regime UK.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another growing trend in Scotland (and the UK) this year was "cherry popper" or "rookie" bouts, with almost every league in Scotland hosting at least one such event this year, including Livingston's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/03/09/new-skaters-on-track-for-new-town-cherry-popper/"&gt;New Town Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we shouldn't just talk about the Leagues themselves. Scottish Referees and NSOs also continued to represent at the highest levels of the sport, with Dundee's Righteous Oxide particularly visible at international level events like MRDWC and ; but many other referees like , and NSOs (many of whom were nominated in the TDTM Listener awards) travelled huge distances and devoted much time to supporting the sport.
Scottish photographers were also supporting international events this year, with Dave McAleavy and Laura MacDonald being both ubiquitous at Scottish games, but also travelling to Tenerife in Dave's case, and to the Men's World Cup in Laura's. (As the two are, between them, the photographers for the two national teams, we expect even more travel in their future.)
Our Announcers didn't do too badly either, with Helliverence near-ubiquitous across UK events, Bairn City's man of many names Graeme "Archie" McPhail supporting MEC [and announcing two tournaments in Scotland without a break in each],  MRDWC media director Chasing Katy appearing at several events, but especially MEC, and Granite City's sMACklemore doing both MEC and  Track Head Announcing at MRDWC itself. The latter two also helped to push on the Scottish contributions to Roller Derby media, with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tdtmpodcast.wordpress.com/"&gt;Talk Derby To Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; podcast [also hosted by King Crazy] going from strength to strength over the year (especially with their excellent coverage of tournament-level events), culminating in a rather huge Listener Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For us at the Scottish Roller Derby Blog, it's also been a good year - we've expanded our coverage again, introduced our own rankings, and even managed to expand into some new fields of video and audio interviews. We also &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/category/mrdwc2016/"&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the Men's Roller Derby World Cup in more depth than we have any previous event. In order to handle this, we &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/"&gt;launched our own annex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to the blog, which hosts links to content which doesn't work well with Wordpress.
We also managed to hit more then 1500 likes on our Facebook page just a few days ago, which was our own goal for 2016!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to Scotland (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/12/31/2016-in-review/1"&gt;page 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) , forward to "The Future" (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/12/31/2016-in-review/3"&gt;page 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;UK and Europe&lt;/h3&gt;
Obviously one of the most exciting developments of 2016 was the announcement of so much International Derby coming to Europe in the next two years. Both World Cups will be in Europe - the Men's in Barcelona and the Women's in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/12/05/a-rainy-day-for-international-roller-derby/"&gt;Greater Manchester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - in 2018; but before that, one MRDA playoff and the Championship itself will be in Europe as well.
With so many Europe-wide international tournaments already happening in Europe (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/10/02/the-road-to-tbc-lessons-from-erdt-and-the-last-world-cup/"&gt;ERDT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/11/27/a-quick-analysis-of-road-to-tbc/"&gt;The Road to...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, SKOD, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/11/17/first-time-tournament-announcing-or-how-chasing-katy-survived-mec-2o16/"&gt;MEC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/03/01/glasgow-at-europes-first-wftda-division-1-tournament/"&gt;European Smackdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and so on... with Newcastle's EuroClash joining the set in 2017), this was almost inevitable at some point, but no-one expected everything but WFTDA to happen at once.
&lt;p&gt;Another positive development in the UK was the coming together of Coaches at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/10/03/uks-first-coaching-summit-derby-stance/"&gt;Derby Stance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Coaching Summit (followed by the Summit at the Ramps, which brought together skaters from multiple disciplines) organised by Rule 56 and the Female Coaching Network. We're very much in favour of people working together to progress the community...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...which is also why we were cheered by the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/12/19/by-their-powers-combined-they-are-leeds-roller-derby/"&gt;announcement very recently&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that Leeds Roller Derby had formed from fusion of Hot Wheel and Leeds Roller Dolls. We'd love to report on more "collaborations" rather than the politics which leads to splits in Roller Derby, and hope this can be a trend for 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Roller Derby media also had some growth in the UK as well, with two new podcasts - &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hellyeahrollerderby.com/"&gt;Hell Yeah! Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; [Croydon and elsewhere] and the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://goodarrows.libsyn.com/podcast"&gt;Good Arrows Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; [Nottingham Roller Derby] both launching this year, with good content already!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;International&lt;/h3&gt;
Internationally, the most exciting places for Roller Derby are always where growth and development is still raring ahead.
&lt;p&gt;So, in East Asia, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/03/16/the-japan-open-the-other-wftda-first-this-year/"&gt;Japan Open Tournament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was possibly the most significant event of the year - the first ever international tournament in the region, hosted in Okinawa and with attendees from the Pacific Region, Australiasia and beyond (Alaska and Copenhagen!). We're very excited to see what the sequel (now managed directly by a consortium of the Japanese leagues) tournament - the Tomodachi in March 2017 - manages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in East Asia, after literally years of development, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/04/04/beijing-roller-derby-and-un-break-ground-in-china-derby-for-equality-with-heforshe-derby-invitational/"&gt;first ever public bout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in China happened, with Beijing Roller Derby hosting a mixed team from the rest of the Asian leagues. This was also a great example of the still-political purpose of Roller Derby, as the event was in promotion of the UN HeForShe project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth has also continued in other regions, with Latin America now hosting a huge number of teams (although their terminology for leagues and teams differs from the USA and Europe), including 3 now in WFTDA (as full members, with more Apprentices). Across Europe and the Middle East, increasing number of countries are growing not just one, but multiple teams - and in the more established countries we've seen huge growth in national level tournaments (the French Nationale is a mighty thing), and other regular events (for ex. the Finnish &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/11/06/the-pohjola-cup-finland-and-russia-compete/"&gt;Pohjola Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; now trans-national as it includes Russia's White Night Furies this year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of National Teams representation, 2016 has seen continued growth in both the Men's and Women's parts of the sport - MRDWC 2016 saw a massive surge in teams attending, filling out Europe and Latin America [Colombia having a last-minute technical hitch which prevented this being even more impressive]; and there are already at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/12/22/new-nations-in-the-world-cup/"&gt;least 5 new Nations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for the 2018 Roller Derby World Cup in Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we were very pleased that WFTDA has started adopting positive policies such as releasing the (alpha) of their new bout stats management tool, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/10/19/bouttime-open-source-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-relevant-to-roller-derby-and-wftda/"&gt;bouttime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, as an open-source project, truly for the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And International Derby Media has also continued to grow, with the startling appearance of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://thederbyapex.com/@thederbyapex"&gt;The Derby Apex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; earlier this year, and their meteoric rise to popularity. We're sure we'll see more good things from them in 2017 and beyond. (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.derbycentral.net/"&gt;Derby Central&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, of course, continued to do great work, covering all of the international things above, and many more.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to Scotland (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/12/31/2016-in-review/1"&gt;page 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) and back to the World (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/12/31/2016-in-review/2"&gt;page 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Future&lt;/h3&gt;
So, what would we like to see in 2017?
&lt;h4&gt;National Teams leveraging PR to promote growth in their "home" nations.&lt;/h4&gt;
Whilst Teams Korea, Philippines and West Indies are all representing their nations, none of them have any leagues &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; those nations to draw skaters from. With all three declaring their intent to use their existence to promote the sport, we'd love to see this bear fruit. (Korea has a league, but like most leagues in East Asia [except Kamikaze Badass in Tokyo, and Tokyo Roller Girls' Neon Roller Monsters team] it is almost entirely composed of non-nationals.)
&lt;h4&gt;The Derby Apex's "Stat Rataissance" actually happening.&lt;/h4&gt;
One of The Apex's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://thederbyapex.com/our-10-favourite-things-from-the-2016-wftda-season-d516ae8284e4#.jmhiwv3pm"&gt;high points&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of the year has been the improved availability of stats for WFTDA bouts, alongside the promotion of bouttime. We're a little more skeptical of this as a global phenomenon - Roller Derby is not just WFTDA teams [in fact, they're still a minority, especially if you include the fact that only A teams count for WFTDA member leagues], and stats availability for the sport as a whole is still relatively poor, despite the best efforts of Flat Track Stats and others. We'd like to see this happen, though, and still have some hope. (Our own effort in this regard - the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRank.html"&gt;SRD Rank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; rating system - is still very much dependant on FTS's own records, which are themselves dependant on both the site's few volunteers and the Roller Derby community itself.)
&lt;h4&gt;Increased openness, transparency and collaboration.&lt;/h4&gt;
One reason why stats are an issue feeds into this next wish: Roller Derby still has problems with openness and transparency. The bouttime release was definitely a positive step from WFTDA, but we think that most Derby bodies (international and national) could improve on their transparency (the MRDA gets points for having a public forum!) and communication. Alongside this, we'd also like to see positive elements of collaboration continue to grow - more things like Derby Stance, more mergers of leagues to make stronger bodies, and generally more "derby spirit".
&lt;h4&gt;A WFTDA Playoff outside North America (and a non-US team winning Champs).&lt;/h4&gt;
As The Apex noted, WFTDA is now the only major entity with "international" contests not to have some component held outside North America. It would be great to see some movement on this, especially with the increasing number of ranked European teams at D2 and even D1 level. (We'd also love to see a non-US team win the WFTDA Championships - Victorian have come ever so close twice now [and they've beaten Rose on neutral ground this year], so 2017 could still be it.)
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what would you like to see in 2017 - from us, or from Roller Derby?

&lt;p&gt;This excitement wasn't simply because Junior derby itself is relatively rare in Scotland still; Resistance Roller Derby aims to be something more than that, with commitments to be a specifically inclusive LGBTI space built into its founding principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out more, we talked to founders Feminist Killjoy and Fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10620" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/qoxwv5noelhywijmqnko.png?w=300" alt="qoxwv5noelhywijmqnko" width="300" height="300"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, you guys sort of burst into visibility from almost invisibility... How long have you been planning Resistance Roller Derby?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: Erm…. [since] May?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: The idea of … I have been, internally, thinking about how to make Juniors happen  in Glasgow, since UKROC 2014. Which was, I guess, November that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: I'd been thinking about the need for a specifically… we'd both independently been thinking about this thing…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;:…making some kind of space of this nature, with an LGBTI focus of roller derby, Queer-focussed roller derby. Inclusive Roller Derby. Junior Roller Derby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;But definitely, that was I went to a workshop in UKROC2014, got excited by it,  but then thought "no, if someone wants to do this, they really have to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; that thing". And didn't really think about it again for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;And then we [looks at Fever] were discussing earlier this year…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: I think we were discussing. Yeah, because I was looking at, I was more thinking about Inclusive spaces in Roller Derby, and the fact that there really isn't something there, at least not what I wanted, and we thought "what if we &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; this thing".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, I think there was a desire on behalf of both of us to tap back into some of the ways that Roller Derby actually could be genuinely revolutionary; as opposed to something which started in a revolutionary way, and is maybe …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: …drifting sideways…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: … in the wrong direction…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: …becoming more like every other sport.[laughs]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: And so we thought that maybe embedding more of the anarchist principles of.. [for example] being financially inclusive, in that that's an issue with roller derby, of the costs. The idea is to be inclusive, and oppose all &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality"&gt;axes of oppression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, as much as it possible can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;And I think also being explicitly, and radically, Queer, is something that [is important]. Of course, Roller Derby is miles ahead of so many other sports already in that kind of inclusion, but the need for spaces which say, right up, this for you, this is what we're here for...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: [This space] is &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; you, rather than … you're not a side-, an after-, thought that we're happy to take along, it is &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: "We're not &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;homophobia, against transphobia&lt;/i&gt;, we're &lt;i&gt;for people who are [LGBTQI]&lt;/i&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;Because, as you've said, Roller Derby &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; pretty inclusive compared to most sports for LGBTI, and also other areas of discrimination, say mental health. We've had, for example, the engagement of Auld Reekie Roller Girls (and other leagues) with the Rainbow Laces campaign, the existence of various exhibition teams (Vagine Regime, but also Crazy Legs, Metal Legs and so on)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you moving beyond merely being inclusive, to doing something specifically for those minorities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, I think it's about not just &lt;em&gt;saying&lt;/em&gt; it's inclusive, but practically embedding those values into the structure, the culture itself. So, [laughs] in terms of policies, the [roller derby] clubs which already exist have been built on a kind of sports-club model, that include things like attendance polices, which are particularly limiting for people who struggle with mental health issues, or various disabilities...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: ..or just financially can't get to practice that week, or having disruption due to home or&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;just can't maintain a regular attendance..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: so lots of these things that are, and even in league leadership positions that are, when you see how they're like "Club Presidents" and the ways that decision making happens, even though it is &lt;i&gt;democratic&lt;/i&gt;, it is not always &lt;i&gt;collectivist&lt;/i&gt;. And so I think it's about &lt;i&gt;radical&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;inclusivity&lt;/i&gt; as opposed to just being a &lt;i&gt;safe&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;space, &lt;/i&gt;or being an&lt;i&gt; inclusive space.&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: And there's also the fact that, as an adult, you can kind of seek out these kind of spaces. But specifically in Glasgow, for young people, there are very very few places where it is safe to be Queer and Trans, and particularly spaces that aren't sexualised or alcohol-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;This is a provision which doesn't exist very much, especially in a sports kind of venue, where you have the opportunity for like, body-positivity&lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;confidence-building&lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;skills&lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;creating a community that&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;just, so I think it's just, the age group is really important, because it's a group which really doesn't have that view of the world and doesn't really have access to the adult roller derby leagues in the way that people over 18 do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, and also in terms of collectivism in an intergenerational sense as well, (I say "intergenerational", but I'm only 23!) , it's just a spectrum of age, so in terms of decision making, in terms of the voice of a 12-year old who's just joined the club being as important to the decision making as us two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;All of those things help to build a culture, but also to sustain these attitudes of collectivism. The thing we've been saying is that "we elevate each other", and the idea is that if we can help to kickstart a culture, that hopefully will sustain itself, then that's really supportive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, maybe some young person will understand that they're valued, their opinion matters, they have a direct say in this thing that they feel really important, and that's maybe an attitude that , with that support, they can carry on in advocating for themselves, in other areas of their life. In their school, or in other places where they're not treated to maybe entirely fairly, and it gives them that backup and that support system and that awareness that they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; entitled to equal treatment, they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; entitled to a voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; So, it's equally not just a Queer-inclusive space, but also a directly Collectivist one, what the Scottish Green Party call "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_democracy"&gt;radical democracy&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, it's not a process, it's consultation; it's about let's see what you want. When the community exists, it'll be about people making decisions for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;So, obviously, it's the two of us just now who have been planning this, but the reason it's been in our heads and not in the world for most of the time it's existed as a concept is because we were really trying to take the time to make sure that our governing document, our policies, and the kind of things that are the bones of the community and the thing itself, exist as something external from us, external from the club when it does exist, whoever is a part of it, and that hopefully that is something that can be in collective ownership, rather than...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: It is intended to be self-sustaining, so we took a long time to work on everything, to make sure that when it came into the world it was something that existed in its own right, and we do need funding to start it, but it already has a form that is external to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/30/glasgows-new-inclusive-junior-derby-resistance-roller-derby/2"&gt;Click here to get to the next page, where we talk about the funding drive and other topics.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On that note, we should talk about the crowdfunder! Apart from its existence in itself, can we talk about what it will be funding specifically? As the Target money is quite low, people might be concerned about…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: sustainability! Yeah...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: The first key cost, to allow us to just begin, is insurance. I've been looking at costing, talking to other junior derby leagues, on the insurance premiums they paid in their first year, and in an ongoing way, we know how expensive that is; that's part of the cost that's factored in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: Basically, the goal of the fundraiser is: in order to apply for sports funding, or register as a proper charity, in order to do all the things that allow us to grow, you first have to exist as a thing that is happening, which is offering training, that has young people using your service. So the goal of the fundraiser, and the reason why it's not a huge target is because that's basically the starting money we need to get our insurance, get kit, take in our small first intake, and become a Thing that Exists. That is offering &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; service to young people in Glasgow. Once we're a thing that exists, we can apply for other funding, we can look at becoming a proper charity, we can grow from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;But essentially, this is just to get us our first intake off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: I think, we don't want to... it would be hypocritical of us to be asking for a lot of money from people who are in the roller derby community, given that our whole kind of thing is that the sport as a whole should be financially accessible. [pause] It is just true that most of the people that will be giving to this fundraiser are people who are already a part of the roller derby community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;And so, asking that community to part with significant sums of money is quite presumptuous. Our intention is to be …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: self-sustaining?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. We need this kind of support to get going, and obviously, however much we can raise is brilliant, and if people want to give what they can give, but it's not for us to be like "we need this amount of money and then we'll be …"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: ..."here's two years of running costs and we'll try and raise this", that isn't what we're trying. This is just what we need to get started, and we can take it from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: We'll be doing fundraising scrimmage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, we've got monthly scrimmages planned for fundraising - adult pickup scrimmages with skaters from other derby leagues, officials training that we're going to do as part of that, we have ongoing fundraising plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: And through small-grant funding, as we hopefully get more distribution. Sports clubs, especially for young people, operate as charities which is our intention. If we can get access to the kind of funds that are coming from these big trusts, these big grant-awarding-bodies, even with small funds, external money, public funding, these kind of things, those funds are there and it makes more sense for us to be trying to source funding from that kind of avenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, rather than from people from the community. There's such a need for this kind of provision, and there's so little of it, that it is definitely a good funding opportunity, once it is a thing which actually exists in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;So, you've said fundraising bouts and adult pickup scrims... will Resistance be mostly Recreational, or are you planning any competitive component?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: I think our intention is to allow the league to be shaped by the people who skate regularly with the league. It's impossible for us to say right now how how it would look like a year from now, or three years from now. I think... people who play roller derby now in the sport are looking for so many different things, and any given group of people that are coming together to play roller derby might have different ambitions and different goals in that regard. Maybe if we begin with an intake, for example let's just say that they're all 12 to 14, five years from now, those people are going to be thinking about adult roller derby. And maybe [Resistance is] going to have to be a thing which moves in that direction, or maybe people will be very comfortable with aging into the other leagues which are available in Glasgow, so I think it's impossible for us to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Definitely, in terms of how we aim to begin, in terms of the way in which adults can be involved as skaters,  it's definitely a recreational, learning, scrimmage environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: yeah, 'cause we're gonna, we're definitely beginning as a youth league, but we'll have adults at our monthly scrimmages, with the intention of doing learning, training, but mostly fundraising for the continued [support]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: And in terms of.. there obviously is a competitive junior roller derby community... not in Scotland...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;- T&lt;strong&gt;here is &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; other junior team in Scotland...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: There is, and we would love to be in a position [to work with them].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: I mean, if they want to end up as a junior buddy league, if that's what the young people want, then we'll go in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: If they want to play other teams, there are junior leagues popping up all over the place. I don't think we're saying we're Recreational in that we can only bout internally or scrimmage internally or anything like that, if people want us to move towards being travelling and playing other places or...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, we'll grow where the young people want to grow to basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: But we're not approaching this from the idea that "this is how we get top-level roller derby elite athletes, start them young and then …"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;i&gt;train them&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— You're not an incubator.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: We are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an incubator. We're very much about the experience of being in the league, at that point in that person's life, and the value to the person in that. We're not about what value that person might be to other roller derby leagues in the future, because that's a really weird [both laugh] way to be looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: I work in sports inclusion, in my day-to-day life, and work with LGBTI young people, and one of the things they always get excited by, is when I talk about the fact that I'm involved in roller derby. And, it's always frustrating to them to then have me explain that do this for three years, or this is a sport you can only access as a spectator, or you can't even [pause]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: I mean even NSOs…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: Because of insurance, yeah. Most adult leagues' insurance doesn't really cover having juniors as NSOs. So, being able to be a space where…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: They can be part of this really awesome thing, because roller derby's pretty great! And a lot of young people are really  really interested in it, so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— So, can we talk about what it is about Roller Derby that interests the young people that you [Killjoy] talk to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: For the people, I feel like I'm just going to end up repeating myself, but for a lot of queer kids, like, queerness is something that's politicised, roller derby is so much more inclusive than other sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The fact that, I work with a lot of transgender young people, and the fact that they can be talking to a transgender adult who's having a great time in as mainstream a version of the sport - it's not fringe roller derby that's inclusive, it's &lt;i&gt;roller derby&lt;/i&gt; that's inclusive. So I think the sport as a whole is a major attraction in that sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;I think the fact that the roots of the sport are fundamentally feminist is particularly attractive for anyone who's ever considered gender politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;I think all of those reasons are reasons for teenagers, particularly people who are at an age where they are beginning to simultaneously recognise and be able to articulate a lot of the ways in which they are being marginalised and disenfranchised by the structures which exist in our society, but are also coming into an age where they're being able to identify their own agency within those systems, so these little kind of pockets and things that they can see that are inherently equipped to be a part of that challenge but at the same time being a nurturing space it's not like jumping into the front line of some kind of political...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: You get to come and skate with your pals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: Its a symbiotic kind of relationship, I give to a movement but also&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;get so much from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—So, last topic: Why &lt;em&gt;Resistance&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: I just have one answer, it's going to be repeating myself! Because it's about resisting! I think we don't want to be &lt;em&gt;polite&lt;/em&gt; about the fact that we're here as a direct challenge to a lot of the social structures and …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: All the terrible things that we do to teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: [laughing slightly] …the terrible things that we do to teenagers. The terrible things that the world does to poor people. All of the things that we just kind of accept with "this is the way it has to be, this is the way you do things" I think we don't want to be quiet about the fact that we're angry about those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;—&lt;strong&gt; That's a fair answer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: Because, being a teenager is quite often not fun. Being a queer, trans teenager is worse. Yeah, it depends on school environment, it depends on family, but it can be &lt;i&gt;terrible&lt;/i&gt;, and it can be an environment that you're stuck in for years, that you have very little power over and very little ability to get out of, and within that struggling with all these things. We're just offering a space where you're allowed to acknowledge that those are challenges that you're facing, and hopefully gain support and gain&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;confidence and in… resisting those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— Yes, one of the issues for trans or queer kids, must be the societial assumption that you can't know you have a non-cis identity, or a non-straight orientation, until you're an adult of whatever "default" gender you appear to be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: It's a fucked up sexual politics, which kind of equates the idea of having a gender identity with&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;having sexuality. Which is really kind of messed up. But I think that's also something that it's very important for us to acknowledge, there's no gatekeeping, there's no quiz, there's no "fill in this form and tell us all the ways you're gay" [Fever laughs], we're going to be really explicit about why we're here, and it's up for people to - we trust people to know themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: If you feel like this is the space for you; then we're here for you. Whatever form of fluidity within that space that you need to be a part of, it's up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

This mixed junior game will take place as part of a triple header hosted by Barnsley Black Heart Rollers and will feature skaters from Sheffield Steel Junior Rollers and Newcastle Junior Roller Derby League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9210" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/13880228_1012374508875985_648255813429450617_n.jpg" alt="13880228_1012374508875985_648255813429450617_n" width="784" height="295"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cubs will be sending thirteen level 3 and advanced skaters to take part, some of whom will be playing in public for the first time, while others are veterans of several intraleagues. Needless to say, the level of excitement is high and the bus journey to Barnsley at 6.30am on Sunday promises to be a lively one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last word (as always), goes to the Cubs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s great to finally play against people that aren't in our own team. As good as it is to have bouts amongst our own team this bout against a different team gives a chance to see how well we are progressing. I'm really excited for the road trip and can't wait to get out on track” – Vanilla Crush.
“I am really happy and excited that we are getting to meet another junior team and play against them” – Lu Dog Millionaire.
“It’s not often that I see 6.30am at the weekend, the long journey will be worth it though, are we there yet?” – Purple Punisher.
“I am super chuffed to be captaining our first away game, it will be an eye opener for all involved I am sure” – Stunami.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4611" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/04/10744964_366809973478799_46185807_n.jpg" alt="10744964_366809973478799_46185807_n" width="960" height="681"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FVRC welcomes boys and girls aged 5-17, with no previous skating experience necessary.  We can provide kit to borrow for the session, with the exception of a mouthguard and helmet, so there is no commitment.  The taster will cover basic skating skills, most importantly, how to stop and fall safely!&lt;/p&gt;

With three fresh meat intakes throughout the year, skater numbers have grown to around thirty 5-17 year olds regularly attending training, across three skill levels. We have retained a large number of skaters from our first few intakes, meaning that at the moment, the majority of our members are level three skaters, although a successful taster session at the start of December should help to boost numbers in levels one and two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/12/cubs2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5271"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone  wp-image-5271 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/12/cubs2.jpg?w=300" alt="cubs2" width="420" height="280"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
This year, Fierce Valley Roller Cubs were invited by three different leagues – Bairn City Rollers, Dundee Roller Girls and Fierce Valley Roller Girls – to take part in double headers. The game in Dundee marked the first time the Cubs played away from Grangemouth – the Cubs word is spreading far and wide! Several newer skaters played for the first time in public at one of these games this year, and all loved the experience. From a coaching point of view, it’s always satisfying to see everything we work on in training come together in a game.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/12/cubs1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5270"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone  wp-image-5270" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/12/cubs1.jpg?w=300" alt="cubs1" width="348" height="232"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year also saw some changes to the way we structure our training, due to a change in the JRDA minimum skills, which brought them almost in line with WFTDA’s mins. This meant that our advanced skaters, i.e. those that had passed the “old” level three, had to work towards the new skills. Despite a step up in skill level and difficulty, all of our skaters worked hard and we already have quite a number who have passed the new level three.
For 2016, our goal is to play against another junior team, which has proved difficult so far due to the lack of other juniors. Fierce Valley Roller Cubs is almost unique in being both co-ed and open to kids as young as five, with most others being either female only, aimed at teenagers, or both. We are ever hopeful that the growth in junior roller derby will produce plenty of opponents for us!
The last words go to a Cub, Hayley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long have you been part of Cubs, and why did you get involved?&lt;/strong&gt;
I've been involved with the Cubs for just over a year now. Like many I first found out about roller derby after watching Whip It, and I quickly became obsessed with the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the Cubs were still in the process of setting up and I went to see my first game in Edinburgh, which made me want to play even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended missing the Cubs starting as i was busy with school and the idea of playing derby slipped my mind, until my dad suggested I see if a junior team had started yet. I then found out that the Cubs had started up and were the only junior team in Scotland, and that they were holding a freshmeat intake in the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really nervous about joining, despite having bought skates a few years back when I had first found derby and getting a bit of practice in. At the taster session I fell and ended up having to get carried out by my dad and I went to the hospital the next day, thankfully nothing was broken (I did however end up with biggest bruise of my life), and from then on I was absolutely hooked on derby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has your involvement in Cubs changed this year?&lt;/strong&gt;
This year I have been helping out at the Sunday sessions for level 1 and 2 skaters as an on skates helper. In doing so my own skating skills have improved, as I've been able to spend more time on skates, but I've also been able to see our fresh meat getting better and more confident at skating and help them develop into great skaters. I've been able to use this volunteer experience to help with my university application and I'm incredibly grateful to all the coaches at the Cubs for this, as skating has given me skills that I can use in other aspects of my life, such as perseverance and commitment, as well as strengthening my confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your biggest achievement this year?&lt;/strong&gt;
My biggest achievement has been passing level 3 for the second time, after the requirements were changed to be closer to WFTDA's minimum skills, which included the dreaded 27 laps in 5 minutes. When I first started skating I thought there was no way I could ever skate that fast or be able to do things like transitions and backwards skating. This year I've really seen myself improve, going from fresh meat at the end of 2014 to advanced now. I've also played in two games this year, including my first game ever, which were also a big achievement. Although both times my team lost, it was amazing to see everyone working together and trying their absolute hardest, no matter what position they were playing. I'm sure anyone that was in attendance will say our last game of the year was an incredibly tense and well fought game, with a lead change of 2 points in the last jam!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/12/cubs3.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5272"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-5272 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/12/cubs3.jpg?w=300" alt="cubs3" width="357" height="238"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hayley jamming in her first game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And what was the most memorable thing you did as part of Cubs?&lt;/strong&gt;
Taking part in my first ever game has to be the most memorable and terrifying thing I've done with the Cubs. I was so nervous before and couldn't imagine myself jamming and definitely not getting lead jammer and picking up points for the team. Although I was shaking before I felt great afterwards. I was incredibly proud of myself and my team for working so hard. I was also proud of the skaters on the other team for putting up such a good fight and playing so well. The second game I played in this year was also memorable as I could see just how much myself and the other skaters had improved in only a few months, as I found that we were playing together as a team much better, by playing offensively to help our jammers and using techniques such as star passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would you like to see in 2016 for FVRC?&lt;/strong&gt;
Unfortunately I won't be with the Cubs for all of 2016 as I'll be turning 18, but I would love to see the Cubs playing other junior teams and continuing to grow in numbers and talent. As there are more junior derby teams starting up in the uk I think 2016 will be a great year for the Cubs to hopefully get to show off all the hard work that the skaters and coaches have put in. I hope that even once I've left I'll be able to come back and support the Cubs, and see the young skaters I've trained with continue to get better and better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fierce Valley Roller Cubs is the only junior roller derby league in Scotland and one of only a handful in the UK. From the first training session in September 2013, the league has grown to over 30 skaters over four levels, and has recently played a third public game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fierce valley roller cubs</category><category>fresh meat</category><category>fvrc</category><category>junior roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/07/24/fierce-valley-roller-cubs-new-skater-intake-2/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2015 10:54:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Visualising the Internationalisation of Roller Derby Part 2 of 2 (2011 to present).</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/06/07/visualising-the-internationalisation-of-roller-derby-part-2-of-2-2011-to-present/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first article in this series (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/06/07/visualising-the-internationalisation-of-roller-derby-part-1-of-2/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) we introduced the use of FlatTrackStats bout records to visualise the connections between derby teams over time.

&lt;p&gt;Previously, we covered the period in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wftda.com"&gt;WFTDA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://mensrollerderbyassociation.org/"&gt;MRDA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.juniorrollerderby.org/home.php"&gt;Junior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;derby from the origins of organised derby in 2005 through to the emergence of junior derby, the men's game and the first truly international period of derby in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will cover the period from 2011 to the start of 2015. As with the previous article, our colour coding scheme is: &lt;span style="color:#ff0000;"&gt;Red is USA&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:#0000ff;"&gt;Blue is Canada&lt;/span&gt;,  &lt;span style="color:#008000;"&gt;Green: Europe&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:#33cccc;"&gt;Cyan: Australia&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:#800080;"&gt;Purple: New Zealand&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:#ffff00;"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffcc00;"&gt;Yellow the Asia-Pacific&lt;/span&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;, and White: Latin America. Groups which are densely connected from playing lots of games together will group physically closer in the plots, while less connected groups are thrown out to the edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of London Rollergirls playing across in the USA in 2010 inspired other European teams to try the same thing a year later (bolstered by the first ever World Cup also being in that year). The largest connected group in &lt;strong&gt;2011&lt;/strong&gt; looked like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-111.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-large wp-image-4687 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-111.png?w=660" alt="W Group 1 2011" width="660" height="644"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the 2010 plot, the additional &lt;strong&gt;European&lt;/strong&gt; teams (&lt;em&gt;Central City&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Lincolnshire Bomber&lt;/em&gt;s et al) connecting with the USA pull the densely connected centre of the plot out somewhat, making it less insular. Conversely, &lt;em&gt;London Rollergirl&lt;/em&gt;s are pulled in the other direction - from this point on, their green dot is the one nestled in the core of the central, well-connected part of the plot, disconnected somewhat from the rest of Europe. We also see that &lt;strong&gt;Australasian&lt;/strong&gt; derby has joined the International community proper, with Victorian Roller Derby League placing them in contact with the Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Latin America&lt;/strong&gt; is showing the first signs of widespread derby growth, with a healthy crop of new leagues all playing each other:
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-31.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-medium wp-image-4688 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-31.png?w=300" alt="W Group 3 2011" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men's derby, by contrast, is not yet fully international in &lt;strong&gt;2011&lt;/strong&gt;, with the biggest connected group resolutely USA and Canada:
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-112.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-large wp-image-4689 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-112.png?w=660" alt="M Group 1 2011" width="660" height="627"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Although both Europe and Latin America are starting to show their own growth:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-32.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-thumbnail wp-image-4690 " src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-32.png?w=150" alt="M Group 3 2011" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-6.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-thumbnail wp-image-4691 " src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-6.png?w=150" alt="M Group 6 2011" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
it was a year later, in &lt;strong&gt;2012&lt;/strong&gt;, that the Men's Derby community joined up across the Atlantic:
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-113.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-large wp-image-4692 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-113.png?w=660" alt="M Group 1 2012" width="660" height="598"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and not until &lt;strong&gt;2013&lt;/strong&gt; that Latin America joined the biggest group:
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-114.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-large wp-image-4693 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-114.png?w=660" alt="M Group 1 2013" width="660" height="634"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
just in time for Men's Derby to properly take off in Australia (now the largest group separate from the main one):
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-23.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-medium wp-image-4694 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-23.png?w=300" alt="M Group 2 2013" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Women's derby was exploding in Europe, and European teams were increasingly travelling across to the USA to play tougher teams, creating a second pole of derby in the community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-115.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-large wp-image-4695 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-115.png?w=660" alt="W Group 1 2013" width="660" height="663"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(notice also the first appearance of Yellow in any of our graphs, as &lt;em&gt;Tokyo Roller Girls&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kokeshi Roller Dolls&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Devil Dog Derby Dames&lt;/em&gt; all make their appearance in the derby scene already integrated into the International scene).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, fast forwarding to the present day, what does roller derby look like at the start of &lt;strong&gt;2015&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women's Derby&lt;/strong&gt; is increasingly truly international, with the dense central cluster of "connected Division 1" type teams being slowly infiltrated by European and Australasian (and a few Latin American) teams drawn in from the edges, although Asia-Pacific derby is still limited to the three Japanese leagues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-116.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-large wp-image-4697 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-116.png?w=660" alt="W Group 1 2014" width="660" height="662"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bucking the trend, however, &lt;strong&gt;Latin American&lt;/strong&gt; derby maintains a strong community of its own, disconnected (for the most part) from the rest of the community:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-24.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4698" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-24.png?w=300" alt="W Group 2 2014" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-4.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4699" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-4.png?w=300" alt="W Group 4 2014" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
as does the geographically separated Alaskan derby community:
&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-33.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4700" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-33.png?w=300" alt="W Group 3 2014" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Mens' Derby&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;2015&lt;/strong&gt; looks a lot like Women's Derby did in 2010 or 2011, with a large group of USA/Europe, connected by only a few European mediators:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-117.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-large wp-image-4701 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-117.png?w=660" alt="M Group 1 2014" width="660" height="633"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(although Men's derby is a lot more balanced in the sizes of the USA and Europe groups than Women's Derby was in 2010), and a strongly developing and independant Australasian Men's Derby group:
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-25.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-medium wp-image-4702 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-25.png?w=300" alt="M Group 2 2014" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Junior Derby&lt;/strong&gt;, meanwhile, is still resolutely an American pursuit for the most part:
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-118.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-large wp-image-4703 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-118.png?w=660" alt="J Group 1 2014" width="660" height="595"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
(the few European Junior Derby leagues tend not to have travel teams, or, in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fiercevalleyrollercubs.co.uk/"&gt;Fierce Valley Roller Cubs'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; case, have no teams with the same age limits to play), although, as with Men's Derby, there's a small Australasian group in evidence as well:
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-34.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" size-thumbnail wp-image-4704 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-34.png?w=150" alt="J Group 3 2014" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The astute reader will, at this point, be asking why we've not talked about &lt;strong&gt;Coed Derby&lt;/strong&gt; yet. The problem with Coed Derby, based on the FTS records, is that most (WFTDA/MRDA) Coed teams have been Exhibition teams, set up without the formal League structure. As such, they are excluded from the terms in which our plots are constructed: there's literally no bouts on record for formal Coed Travel Teams until 2013!
Interestingly, what Coed Derby there is seems to be following a very different track from the USA-led structures in the rest of the community. The single biggest grouping of Coed Teams in &lt;strong&gt;2013&lt;/strong&gt; was entirely Europe (in fact, UK) based:
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-119.png"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-4705 size-medium" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/06/group-119.png?w=300" alt="C Group 1 2014" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what for the future?&lt;/strong&gt;
Well, on the trends we've seen so far, I expect &lt;strong&gt;Men's&lt;/strong&gt; Derby to follow a rather even development, with Australasia joining the International group within the next year, forming a rather well balanced community split three ways in weighting.
&lt;strong&gt;Women's&lt;/strong&gt; Derby remains rather unbalanced towards the USA, just because of the delay in derby seeding outside that continent. The evidence suggests that the power imbalance is slowly easing (Glasgow Roller Derby making it into the &lt;a href="http://wftda.com/rankings"&gt;top 30 WFTDA teams&lt;/a&gt; recently, with Stockholm and Helsinki just outside, is a sign of this), but it will probably take several more years before the core derby cluster is noticeably less red than it is now. (We expect it to take about as long for London Rollergirls A to reconnect with the rest of European derby.) The newest region, Asia-Pacific, is something we will cover in a few planned articles to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Junior&lt;/strong&gt; Derby's status outside of the USA is worrying - the evidence from the last year, as several very talented US players have graduated from Junior to Women's derby leagues, suggests that a strong Junior Derby community is very important in the maintenance of a strong Adult community as well. We hope that more will be done in this area across Europe in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;strong&gt;Coed&lt;/strong&gt; Derby - it's impossibly early to predict. It's possible that the growth of formal teams could be driven entirely from Europe, but as there is no history of this in the sport to date, it is very hard to predict what form its influence could take.&lt;/p&gt;
