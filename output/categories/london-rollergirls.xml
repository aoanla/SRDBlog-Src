In fact, this May looks like being busier than the previous months in terms of events!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/28/glasgow-to-pack-may-with-events/queeri/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-7190"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7190" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/queeri.jpg" alt="queeri" width="500" height="353"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, &lt;strong&gt;May 7th&lt;/strong&gt; sees the return of GRD's popular Queerosity night from earlier in the year, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.glasgowrollerderby.com/events-calendar/2016/5/7/queeriosity-2-90s-grunge-queer-night-with-grd"&gt;this time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with a 90s Grunge feel. The night will run from &lt;strong&gt;7:30pm&lt;/strong&gt; to midnight, at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Garnethill+Multicultural+Centre/@55.8662629,-4.2637716,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x48884426c0484e89:0x5c326c655662014c"&gt;Garnethill Multicultural Centre,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and tickets are available for just &lt;strong&gt;£2&lt;/strong&gt; online (£3 on the door)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on &lt;strong&gt;May 21&lt;/strong&gt;, GRD B, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.glasgowrollerderby.com/events-calendar/2016/5/21/double-header-maiden-grrders-vs-amiens-roller-derby-irn-bruisers-vs-middlesbrough-milk-rollers"&gt;Maiden Grrders, will be taking on Blackpool Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Blackpool have had quite a Scottish theme for their year already, having sent a team to the Fierce Valley hosted sur5al and, of course, been both hosted and competed against by Aberdeen's Granite City Roller Derby in Tier 4 of British Champs.
This bout sees the Blackpool Roller Coasters play their toughest opponents yet; the Maiden Grrders are higher ranked than any of the teams in Tier 4 North!
The bout will be held in Glasgow's traditional venue, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/ARC:+Health+and+Fitness/@55.8662153,-4.2519289,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4888441f10416197:0x3a9426f40d4b58b7"&gt;ARC Sports Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at Glasgow Caledonian University, starting at &lt;strong&gt;midday&lt;/strong&gt;. Tickets will be the usual &lt;strong&gt;£6&lt;/strong&gt; online, or a little more on the door.
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/28/glasgow-to-pack-may-with-events/bootcamp/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-7191"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7191" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/bootcamp.jpg" alt="bootcamp" width="500" height="355"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the jewel of the May schedule comes the day after, as London Brawling's Stefanie Mainey will be holding &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.glasgowrollerderby.com/events-calendar/2016/5/22/grd-presents-bootcamp-with-stefanie-mainey"&gt;a Co-ed Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, hosted by GRD on &lt;strong&gt;May 22nd&lt;/strong&gt;.
To take advantage of her considerable experience as both a coach and skater in one of the top 4 roller derby teams in the World, this will be an Intermediate Skills bootcamp.
Tickets for offskates observers are also available, at a reduced rate (&lt;strong&gt;£25&lt;/strong&gt; versus &lt;strong&gt;£50&lt;/strong&gt; for onskates).
Hosted at the ARC, the bootcamp will fill the afternoon from &lt;strong&gt;1pm&lt;/strong&gt; to 5.45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/11/18/gotham-rose-victorian-a-three-way-tie/"&gt;a previous article&lt;/a&gt;, despite the fact that Euro Smackdown wasn't a true tournament (it was more of an invitational, with teams playing different numbers of bouts, and no attempt at ranking them by performance), the fact that it produced a large number of match-ups means that we can use Bayesian inference techniques to infer what the actual relative power of the participating teams are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start off, lets look at the actual results (versus the predictions from &lt;a href="http://www.flattrackstats.com"&gt;FlatTrackStats&lt;/a&gt;). We don't consider WFTDA Rankings because the ranking scheme that WFTDA uses combines Team Strength with Strength of Schedule (how many "hard" opponents you played), and so does not purely reflect the actual relative strength of teams.

&lt;td&gt;(5.9) 3.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; 5.4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
What's quite interesting here is that, while FTS was very wrong as to the magnitude of most of the score ratios, it was actually only wrong once as to the result of a bout - calling Detroit/Helsinki for Detroit. This was also the closest bout of the entire tournament - and Detroit was winning, with a score-ratio close to what FTS predicted, at the end of the first period.
&lt;p&gt;Another thing we can see is which games were "games of two halves" - the Detroit/Helsinki, Glasgow/London and London/Malmö games all exhibit very strong shifts between the scores at half-time and full-time - in fact, by almost 50%!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the actual strength calculations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran 300000 steps of a Bayesian Monte-Carlo simulation on the Euro Smackdown data, with 600 "walkers" per step. This allows us to explore the space of "possible strengths" and determine what the most likely strengths are for each Team competing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As London Roller Girls were overwhelmingly likely to be the strongest team in the tournament, we calculate strengths for the remaining 5 teams relative to London. Strength here is "how many points London would score, in an average game, for every point the team scored". We use FTS ratings as a basis for our comparisons, as WFTDA rankings do not purely reflect the strength of teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6274" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/03/figure_1-es2.png" alt="figure_1-es2" width="1996" height="1050"&gt; Plot of predicted and inferred Team Strengths (relative to London Roller Girls). Strengths are "approximate number of points London would score, for every point the Team scores")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This graph shows two sets of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vertical lines indicate how strong FlatTrackStats thought the teams should be, relative to London Roller Girls, before the tournament starts. As FlatTrackStats's ranking algorithm is relatively conservative, this approximates to the performance of the teams at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The histograms show the distribution of "consistent" team strengths, inferred from the results of European Smackdown. The peaks of the distributions correspond to the most likely strengths for each team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be seen, there's two pretty obvious outliers - Crime City Rollers (marked as "Malmo") are significantly stronger than FTS thought they should be; and Glasgow Roller Derby are significantly weaker. The other three teams, Detroit, Helsinki and Stockholm are bunched close enough together that it's hard to separate them in this scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can get a better look at the grouping for lower strength teams if we exclude the London bouts from consideration. One issue with London's strength is that its opponents score lower, meaning that each point is "worth" more in terms of altering their proportional strength. (The difference between a final score of 3 and 4 is a 33% change in your strength!) This makes predictions a bit more fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6353" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/03/figure_1-malmo.png" alt="figure_1-malmo" width="1726" height="831"&gt; Inferred strengths for Detroit, Stockholm, Helsinki, Glasgow with respect to Crime City (as Malmo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above graph is calculated in the same way, but from only the bouts not involving London (and therefore shows strength relative to Crime City, as MALMO). It's a little clearer from this analysis that Detroit is measurably distinct in strength from Stockholm and Helsinki, and Stockholm and Helsinki are almost separable themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting feature of the full analysis, is that, while the outliers are both "far" from their predictions, the set of all strengths is still relatively symmetrically distributed around FTS's predictions. This implies that London themselves haven't significantly altered in strength over the winter - any large shifts in the teams relative to them are due to those teams own strength changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of this analysis suggest that either Crime City Rollers had a significant home-teams advantage, or they're significantly improved (by about 50%) after taking a break over Winter. If the latter is the case, we expect them to be a significant force in Division 1 this year - this performance puts them closer to teams like Montreal or Atlanta!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Glasgow's performance this year seems to have been hit by the departure of several strong pivots from the A-Team Roster, with Mona Rampage, (The Very Hungry) Splat(erkiller), and Jen Sykes all missing from the roster. Conservatively, their performance here is roughly 1/6th as strong as they evidenced in Division 1 tournament in the USA last year. Hopefully, this is simply a consequence of the restructuring early in the season, and the new roster will continue to strengthen and gel over the coming year...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the other teams, Stockholm have slightly fallen back from their high-point last year, possibly following the departure of one of their star jammers, Mad Malooney. (It's tempting to suggest that the slight increase in performance by Helsinki is related, partly, to their gaining the same skater!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are no less than three double-header events for British Champs this weekend featuring Scottish teams, and two of them are being hosted up in Scotland itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Auld Reekie Roller Girls, Voodoo Roller Dollies and New Town Roller Girls all having left British Champs for various reasons after the 2015 Season, there are currently 4 Scottish leagues still competing in the schedules, all of whom play this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working up the tiers, then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;Saturday&lt;/strong&gt;, Aberdeen's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.granitecityrollerderby.co.uk/"&gt;Granite City Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are hosting the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/199093520445006/"&gt;first fixture&lt;/a&gt; of the Tier 4 North Division, in their usual venue, the Beach Leisure Centre. The double header will see Blackpool Roller Derby League take on Halifax Bruising Banditas; followed by hosts Granite City taking on Durham Roller Derby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-medium wp-image-5755 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/02/12525411_10154612912394012_7934633322794908992_o.jpg?w=212" alt="12525411_10154612912394012_7934633322794908992_o" width="212" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flattrackstats.com"&gt;FlatTrackStats&lt;/a&gt; predicts a win for GCRD over Durham; however, the Halifax/Blackpool bout should be extremely close, potentially coming down to the final jam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCRD are hosting at the &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Beach+Leisure+Centre/@57.1556049,-2.0820887,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x48840e4028217933:0x30c6b9176815da5b"&gt;Beach Leisure Centre&lt;/a&gt;. Doors open at 12:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down in &lt;strong&gt;Preston&lt;/strong&gt;, both &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/dundeerollergirls/"&gt;Dundee Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.fvrg.co.uk/"&gt;Fierce Valley Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt; will be competing in the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1755123161386637/"&gt;first fixture&lt;/a&gt; in T3 North on &lt;strong&gt;Saturday&lt;/strong&gt;. FVRG will lead the schedule, taking on Hull's Angels Roller Dames; Dundee Roller Girls follow, taking on hosts Preston Roller Girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTS's predictions here are that H.A.R.D. should triumph over Fierce Valley, while hosts Preston should lose, albeit narrowly, against Dundee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-medium wp-image-5743 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/02/brit-champs-t3-gameday-1-768x768.jpg?w=300" alt="Brit-Champs-T3-Gameday-1-768x768" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event will be held in Preston's usual venue, &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Preston's+College/@53.7849145,-2.7022612,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x487b721b0a2e51eb:0x9868b02f36edca68"&gt;Preston's College&lt;/a&gt;. Doors open at &lt;strong&gt;midday&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.glasgowrollerderby.com"&gt;Glasgow Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; will be hosting the&lt;a href="http://www.glasgowrollerderby.com/events-calendar/2016/2/21/british-roller-derby-championships-double-header"&gt; first games&lt;/a&gt; of the T1 "Premier" Division, on &lt;strong&gt;Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;! While Glasgow won the T1 Division last year, they're also one of the few teams from T1 returning from the last time: this first fixture sees them facing Newcastle Roller Girls (who promoted from T2 last year) and also facing London Rollergirls B, who are new to the Championships. Glasgow will be keen to prove that they're capable of defending their title against new challengers, while Newcastle will be equally keen to show that they deserve their promotion from Tier 2, and the Brawl Saints will want to make their mark as incomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5761" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/02/12646940_10156610083540389_6438710273192564289_n.jpg" alt="12646940_10156610083540389_6438710273192564289_n" width="960" height="303"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking to FlatTrackStats, it expects Glasgow to take an easy win against Newcastle, but a more challenging one against London's Brawl Saints. With the London bout second, it could be even closer than FTS expects; the statistics don't take into account the possibility that one team might be more tired after playing previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glasgow are hosting this event at their regular venue, the &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/ARC:+Health+and+Fitness/@55.8662183,-4.2519236,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4888441f10416197:0x3a9426f40d4b58b7"&gt;ARC Health and Fitness&lt;/a&gt; at Glasgow Caledonian University.

To date, however, all of these approaches have been drawn from a single philosophy, the "frequentist" approach to statistics. We're going to apply a different approach in this article, to examine what we can say about the relative strengths of London Rollergirls, Gotham Girls Roller Derby, Rose City Rollers and Victorian Roller Derby League in the aftermath of an incredibly closely contested &lt;a href="https://wftda.com/tournaments/2015/championships"&gt;WFTDA Championships&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, there are essentially &lt;a href="http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/03/11/frequentism-and-bayesianism-a-practical-intro/"&gt;two main philosophies&lt;/a&gt;, diametrically opposite in approach, to statistical inference. "Frequentist" approaches attempt to determine how likely your observations are for a given reality, while Bayesian approaches are concerned with how likely a given reality is, given the observations you've made. (To put it another way: Bayesian statistics is all about determining the range of certainty you can have about reality.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've mostly been using frequentist approaches to our modelling here, because Bayesian techniques often require a lot more computational effort to produce results. In order to determine the range of possible true values, you have to examine a large number of possibilities - and the size of the space to explore grows rapidly with the number of options. For the 1200 or so Women's Teams in the Flat Track Stats database, each possibility we'd have to compare would be a list of 1200 values, each a possible strength for an individual team. It's fairly clear that this gives a huge space of possibilities, which would be exceptionally hard to properly search and characterise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the WFTDA Championships, however, there's a much smaller space to explore - only the possible strengths of the 12 attending teams need to be explored. While this is still a 12 dimensional space, it's definitely a tractable problem, with a few hours of computer time, and a few gigabytes of memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the python package &lt;a href="http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/"&gt;emcee&lt;/a&gt; to perform the relevant Bayesian inference. Taking the results of all of the games at WFTDA Champs, we assumed that the performance of any team would vary in a "Gaussian" manner around their true strength. As we don't strictly know how much variation a team would have in their performance, we explored the possible values of this variation (the standard deviation, usually represented by σ) along with the strengths of the teams&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to provide a more constrained search space, we also assumed that teams wouldn't vary in performance by more than a factor of two, and that the best teams would be less than about 8 times better than the worst, and that no team would be more than about 1.6 times better than Victorian Roller Derby League.&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran approximately 5 million samples of possible strengths and σs against the results of WFTDA Champs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also ran another 5 million samples of possible strengths, with σ fixed to the most likely value (0.2, roughly corresponding to a natural variation of about 14% in team performance from game to game&lt;sup&gt;***&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these results, we can plot so-called "corner plots", which project the full 12 dimensional space of possible team strengths into nice 2-d contour plots and 1-d histograms so we can visualise them easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we have only 12 games as input data, there's quite a bit of statistical uncertainty in the true strengths of the teams involved. What we're mostly concerned about is what we can say about the possible "true" strengths of London, Gotham and Rose, relative to Victorian, so we're only going to reproduce the corner of the full plot which shows this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5023" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2015/11/corner-of-triangle-colours.png" alt="corner-of-triangle-colours" width="748" height="748"&gt; Corner plot of posterior probability for London Rollergirls, Rose City Rollers, Gotham Girls Roller Derby log(strength) with respect to Victorian Roller Derby. Positive and negative quarters coloured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this plot, values greater than 0 indicate "stronger than Victorian" and values less than 0 indicate "weaker than Victorian". We've coloured the 2d contour plots so that the region corresponding to both teams being &lt;em&gt;stronger&lt;/em&gt; than VRDL is light blue, and the region corresponding to both teams being &lt;em&gt;weaker&lt;/em&gt; than VRDL is pink. The 1-d histograms are coloured light blue in the regions where the team would be stronger than VRDL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it's clear from all graphs that the data strongly supports realities ("model parameters") where London Rollergirls are weaker than VRDL. The suggested most likely model parameters have London with log(strength) equal to -0.16, which corresponds to them being about 85% as strong as Victorian, but the error bars allow some variation around that, potentially as high as 1% stronger than Victorian, at the highest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more interesting, and exciting for roller derby as a high end competitive sport, is that the statistics are much less definitive for Gotham and Rose. While both have most likely strengths very slightly below that of Victorian (95% and 96% respectively), the error bars actually cover almost as many cases where each is stronger than Victorian as those where they are weaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that, within the constraints of the statistics, and the model used, all three teams are &lt;em&gt;indistinguishable&lt;/em&gt; in strength. If we got all three teams back onto a track to play, right now, it would be almost impossible to predict who would win each contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, after 4 consecutive years where only one team had a seemingly unassailable lead over all others, this is a very positive sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code used to generate these plots is available in the github repository for our statistical Derby code, as &lt;a href="https://github.com/aoanla/ranking-chain-inference/blob/master/emcee-bayes.py"&gt;emcee-bayes.py&lt;/a&gt;. As with all code in this repository, it is licensed &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"&gt;Creative Commons: Attribution, NonCommercial, ShareAlike&lt;/a&gt;. The code requires a data file of bout records, and is written in Python, using the emcee and numpy Python modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;Strictly, we actually fix the strength of VRDL to 1, as what we're interested in is the relative strengths of the teams involved. Setting a single team strength to a reference value does not compromise the generality of the solution, and gives us a free variable to use to optimise σ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;Specifically, σ is constrained to be positive and less than 1, and the log(strength) of teams is constrained to be between -2 and 0.5 (relative to VRDL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;***&lt;/sup&gt;σ is strictly modelled as the variation in performance for any &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt;, not any team - if we assume that both teams vary to the same degree, then the teams will each vary by √2 of that, or 14%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>gotham girls roller derby</category><category>london rollergirls</category><category>rose city rollers</category><category>statistics</category><category>victorian roller derby league</category><category>wftda</category><category>wftda championships</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2015/11/18/gotham-rose-victorian-a-three-way-tie/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2015 17:58:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Exciting bouts ahead for Glasgow Roller Derby</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/09/12/exciting-bouts-ahead-for-glasgow-roller-derby/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next couple of weeks are an exciting time for fans of Glasgow Roller Derby, with all three travel teams set to bout in the next month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, GRD's A-team, the Irn Bruisers, will take on Middlesbrough Milk Rollers in what is sure to be an exciting bout (the Maidens and MMR have are closely in UKRDA's UK rankings, but Flat Track Stats &lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/55057/rankings"&gt;predicts&lt;/a&gt; a GRD home win).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/09/middlesbrough.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-3748 aligncenter" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/09/middlesbrough.jpg" alt="GRD B v MMR bout poster" width="400" height="569"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://glasgowrollerderby.com/content/grds-irn-bruisers-vs-middlesborough-milk-rollers"&gt;http://glasgowrollerderby.com/content/grds-irn-bruisers-vs-middlesborough-milk-rollers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, only two weeks later (leaving a gap for &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1460050400931616/"&gt;Team Scotland's Bootcamp &lt;/a&gt;on the 20th), Glasgow B, the Maiden Grrders, will take on London Rollergirls' imposing C team, Batter C Power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this fixture is not yet listed on Flat Track Stats, their &lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/predictortool/q/10262/7939"&gt;predictor&lt;/a&gt; expects a very close bout, with only a 10% score difference between win and loss. Tickets will be only £5 online, so it's definitely worth buying ahead of time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://glasgowrollerderby.com/content/maiden-grrders-v-batter-c-power-london"&gt;http://glasgowrollerderby.com/content/maiden-grrders-v-batter-c-power-london&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, on the 4th of October, we are informed that Glasgow C-team, the Canny Gingers, will be taking part in a double-header with Mean City Roller Derby.  Their opponents will be Bairn City Rollers' Central Belters.  It is probably true to say that the Gingers would like very much to take home a win from this match up, but the Central Belters will not go easy on them. (FTS gives the home team the advantage, based on &lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/predictortool/q/45330/25958"&gt;stats&lt;/a&gt;, but since both teams will probably have an altered composition, there's still all to play for.)&lt;/p&gt;
