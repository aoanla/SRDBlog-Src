&lt;p&gt;Doors open at &lt;strong&gt;12:3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0, &lt;/strong&gt;with the Bonnie Colliders taking on&lt;strong&gt; Mean City&lt;/strong&gt; first and the Silvery Tayzers taking on a mixed side of skaters from across the land!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to an unfortunate drop out of a previous opponent. The Silvery Tayzers have switched up the second game to a mixed side open to opt ins! DRD are still on the look out for skaters to play in this game, starting at &lt;strong&gt;3pm. &lt;/strong&gt;It is open to: WFTDA gender policy, ideally advanced, skaters and Dundee are offering hosting, if that is needed. If you would like to opt in for the game, all you need to do is email &lt;strong&gt;DundeeRollerDerby@gmail.com&lt;/strong&gt; with your details! The deadline for opt in to play is &lt;strong&gt;22/08&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/2018.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the run up to these fantastic games, we had a wee catch up with both Mean City and The Bonnie Colliders to see how the sides are shaping up!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Throughout our sessions we have remained focused on our skills and gameplay while having the best time with our fellow meanies. We look forward to the challenge, the team building and most importantly, skating on track with the Bonnie Colliders."&lt;strong&gt; - Megatron&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Mean City)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Colliders are buzzed to be playing on their home turf! We have a strong team and have outlined strong focuses for each skater. New tactics for ourselves and new players coming into our team have us really excited for this game. Especially since we haven't had the chance to play the wonderful meanies yet!" &lt;strong&gt;- Tiny Tearaway&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bonnie Colliders)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-27230" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/08/39127098_1349993311803752_1458506761269936128_n.jpg?w=300" alt="Mean City" width="300" height="200"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"..We are super excited in anticipation of our bout with the Bonnie Colliders on the 25th August.  It is sure to be an exciting game that is both challenging and exceptionally rewarding.  As a league we are keen to show everyone a good time while playing our beloved sport with some amazing skaters." - &lt;strong&gt;Magatron&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Mean City)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;img class=" size-medium wp-image-27231 alignleft" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/08/32915322_1821085297956877_529342680438669312_n.jpg?w=300" alt="32915322_1821085297956877_529342680438669312_n" width="300" height="225"&gt;"Playing with other local leagues is such a rewarding challenge, we've all seen each other play in open scrims and each others' games, and its really fun to have us all come together! The Colliders work hard as a team, and as part of the DRD. We all grow together, work together and have fun together! We can't wait to get on track!" - &lt;strong&gt;Tiny Tearaway&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Bonnie Colliders)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although league members have been hinting at this for a while, the financial and business aspects, have led to a longer than expected timeframe for this re-brand.
&lt;img class="  wp-image-26597 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/04/29884504_2031848993705292_1278327300_o.png" alt="Quote from DRD" width="410" height="410"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With it well underway however, we spoke to a few league members to understand what this means to them, obviously paired with a few snapshots of the league!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"For me, every single league member deserves to be part of our name, rather than only those that identify with the word "girls"."&lt;/em&gt; - Gegg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I started roller derby at 36, I hadn't been a girl for a long time. Think this is brilliant and so much more inclusive".&lt;/em&gt; - Emma Belter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"It shows the progression and maturity of our league. We showed what we can do on track last year and made our name as a league by our games, now we are taking another step and showing our league for who we really are and what we believe in. Seeing everyone as an individual and including all as part of DRD"&lt;/em&gt;. - Goldginger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"When we say: We Are The DRD at games, it really will mean "we" now!"&lt;/em&gt; - Nichola&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The change of name represents the bigger changes that are happening in roller derby worldwide, and our name will now finally reflect every member of our league."&lt;/em&gt; - Liston&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I personally identify as a girl, but it took me a long time to be okay with that, and I think it's really cool that people that don't are now part of the league not just in person but in name to!"&lt;/em&gt; - Amy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The rebrand shows we are a league inclusive and transparent to everyone. Everyone is heard!"&lt;/em&gt; - Tiny Tearaway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It means to me that we can be fully inclusive of everyone, and convey that message on to this and the next generation as well that anyone can do Derby, you just have to believe in yourself!"&lt;/em&gt; - KinKhey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"This change signifies that we are not just skaters here. We are officials, volunteers, NSOs, friends and family. Dundee is an inclusive league of everyone; anyone wishing to be a member of our league can be and that is now represented in our name."&lt;/em&gt;- Shuggs Bunny&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24432" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/09/save-the-date.png" alt="Save The Date" width="3100" height="1430"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Seven teams consisting of only seven skaters will battle against each other in 21 minute games of high intensity roller derby! All in the hopes of being crowned the most sickening team of all!!
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time that DRG are bringing the thrills of a sevens tournament to Dundee, with no timeouts, no official reviews and only 7 skaters per team! What more could you want from a day of derby? How about 7 awesome &lt;strong&gt;RuPaul's Drag Race&lt;/strong&gt; inspired team names with their very own catchphrases???
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Laganja Estranja&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;strong&gt;YES GAWD!
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Adore Delano&lt;/em&gt; –&lt;strong&gt; PARTY!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Team Shangela&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;strong&gt;HALLELOU!
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Alaska&lt;/em&gt; -&lt;strong&gt; HIIEEEEEE!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Bianca Del Rio&lt;/em&gt; –&lt;strong&gt; Not Today Satan
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Bob the Drag Queen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; – Purse Furst
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Jinkx Monsoon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; – Water off a Ducks Back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24507" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/09/filal-7.png" alt="Dundee Logos for Sevens" width="1536" height="1236"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DRG still have team applications open so don’t miss out! Apply here with your team of seven: &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEzC2MrWUOW7SsJge19qlwrMAsFYKzOEuvuFXFflaLUzoFFw/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Application for Full Seven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not quite got a full team of seven? Don't worry Dundee have thought of that as well and are now accepting single skater applicants to skate in a mixed side: &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwK9wmfSPJ5DJCjT8a8hQqBhGlZYDLB9-rP-fTRLbPv-pZPQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Application for Single Skaters
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you think Dundee have left out the most on-the-nose team name you could think of: WELL THINK AGAIN! Team RuPaul has been left for the most important group of the whole day.... The Officials!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-medium wp-image-24515 aligncenter" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/09/21744549_10155556403215821_1030918533_n.jpg?w=250" alt="Officials are the best aren't they??" width="250" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spectator tickets will also be available for your friends and family to come to this full day event at &lt;strong&gt;Dundee International Sports Complex (D.I.S.C)&lt;/strong&gt; on Mains Loan. There will be a chance to buy Dundee's Merch (including the limited edition coveted Tie Dye shirts!!), a classic bake sale for all your daily cake consumption needs as well as a handful of local business to be announced as vendors, across &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/dundeerollergirls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;DRG's Social Media&lt;/a&gt; in the upcoming weeks!&lt;/p&gt;

On the &lt;strong&gt;22nd of July &lt;/strong&gt;at the &lt;strong&gt;D.I.S.C.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Dundee&lt;/strong&gt;, the Bonnie Colliders are taking on Bairn City (&amp;amp; pals!) which looks to be a mighty match! With doors opening at &lt;strong&gt;12:30 &lt;/strong&gt;and first whistle coming in at &lt;strong&gt;1pm,&lt;/strong&gt; it's gonna be a short and sweet single header. Differing from DRG's usual doubles hitters,  these two familiar sides will most certainly make the trip worth while!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="  wp-image-22412 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/07/19621172_1505774156154661_5391157900722134871_o.jpg" alt="Photo Courtesy: Laura MacDonald" width="520" height="736"&gt;
We thought we would catch up with the Bonnie Colliders Co Captains for 2017, &lt;strong&gt;Breezy Does It #289&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;HullabaLou #17&lt;/strong&gt;, to learn a bit more about leading and shaping a B team!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids="22420,22421" type="circle" columns="2"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q1: How has the season gone so far for you guys? You've have a few games already and you seem to come out strong both sides.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breezy:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This season has been amazing so far, we've played those two games and won both, which is super exciting! The team is really starting to gel together and we are getting better every time we play. We've had a few newer skaters join us and they are coming on great and are fitting in well with the team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HullabaLou: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It's just been so epic this season, I am so so proud of everyone! To see our wee team taking the skills that we drill together every week at training and scrims, and put them into practice during games is fantastic – whether it’s fancy new toe stop spins, some super controlled one-one blocking or crushing offense; the commitment and effort from every person on the team is something that I respect hugely and do not take for granted as a Captain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q2: And so the Colliders have played a Bairn side a few times, with the most recent in 2015 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/71209" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;[FTS]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;. How does that change your look on this match-up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I was off on maternity for all of 2015 so unfortunately wasn't part of the team on that one but I was there for the previous year and it was such a tough game! Bairn have continued to grow so much since then, really we're looking at them as a brand new opponent. Which for a lot of our Colliders this season - they will be!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The 2015 game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; was one of the firsts for quite a few of us who had just been rostered for the B team, and was definitely quite an experience for us haha! Bairn are so lovely and we genuinely can’t wait to play them again, but will definitely be needing as many of our Collidoscopes (our loyal fans) to support us as possible!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q3: How do you guys approach a game when you are captaining, what goes through your mind?
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I approach all games in a similar manner, nervous anticipation! The difference as a Co-Captain is that I like to check in with all the skaters to find out how they're feeling, as Lou and I want each skater to enjoy themselves and feel comfortable on game day. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ll we want as Captains is to ensure our team has an absolute blast on game day, I just want to help them smash their goals and whip out those hard-practiced skills! Colliders are definitely all about soaking up the sheer enjoyment of simply playing roller derby together! To quote our wonderful co-chair Milky “It’s just a made-up game on roller skates” and so I try to focus on that…we are from Fundee after all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q4: With the Silvery Tayzers (Dundee's A team) getting quite a lot of focus now with the league being full WFTDA members, do you feel that adds more pressure for you guys, or is it the opposite and you loose some track time as a B team?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;DRG train as a league, first and foremost. We all skate together. We have skaters who've just passed their minimum skills alongside our Team Scotland skaters. It is a huge benefit to all our skaters as we work together to push each other on in every aspect. As a team, the Colliders do get lots of track time together to work as a unit, and practice our tactics and skills, but training alongside the Silvery Tayzers really pushes us out of our comfort zones and helps us develop further. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;DRG definitely think of ourselves as a league rather than 2 teams – we train together, scrim together and thoroughly support each other; the success of the Tayzers and their sweeeeet wftda ranking (266th!)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;[16/07/2017 FTS]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; has only boosted our league spirit. And likewise when the Colliders smash it, the mad support from the rest of the league is just unparalleled. Personally, that’s one of the things I love most about DRG: Our wonderful bouting committee have always placed an equal importance on getting games for both Colliders and Tayzers….so short answer – no, we never lose track time!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q5: With that in mind, what do you guys aim for, for yourselves and your team? It must be hard to maintain such a close-knit team, with skaters moving on to the A team or with the new intake coming up.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; My aim is to work alongside all of our current skaters and those moving up from the new skater programme to encourage them to practice in the hopes that our team can grow stronger. As for keeping the team close knit, I think that comes from our training atmosphere. Lou and I are very open in terms of communication and encourage skaters to bring any issues to us in the hopes that everyone feels driven but not pushed, as being a Collider is always about having the best experience possible and taking away as much as you can from both training, scrimmage and game days!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think that as a team we definitely drive ourselves forward and regardless of experience-level our training committee has always worked us hard to constantly improve our play. Being a B team, the roster is a lot more dynamic; newer skaters come up, more experienced skaters move to the A team, and it changes a lot. We do actively focus on learning how each other blocks/jams so can we gel on track but because we all train together, even when a skater does reach a certain level experience and makes that tough decision to bout exclusively with the A team, it doesn’t really feel like we’ve lost them because we'll be drilling/scrimming with them the week after anyways. Saying that we did have a very emotional locker-room-team-cry after a speech from last season’s stepping down Captains… but I think that just goes to show how much we bond as a team…or perhaps how emotionally unstable a bunch of us are…possibly both.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dundee Roller Girls are hosting their first ever bootcamp on the &lt;strong&gt;first of July&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Manhattan Works, Dundee! &lt;/strong&gt;Open to all, this bootcamp is welcoming pre mins skaters as well as recently passed individuals looking to cement their derby skillz! This event boasts four hours (&lt;strong&gt;11am - 3pm) &lt;/strong&gt;of minimal contact training, with on skates tickets selling out on day 1 - &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;spectator tickets are left for a mere £10 a head!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking the day down into sections: the five DRG coaches are Goldginger #77, G-Wrecks #713, Hubs #88, Landsborough #792 and Liston #07! Attendees can look forward to the following lessons:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;♥ Wall work with Hubs and G-Wrecks! ♥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter  wp-image-20812" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/06/walls.png?w=300" alt="walls" width="446" height="336"&gt; &lt;em&gt;"We can't wait to get started on our block for the bootcamp! Sharing skating skills with newer skaters and encouraging everyone, no matter their skating levels, to engage with the core skills needed to further roller derby in Scotland is something we both really want to be a part of! It's really the best way to start the summer!!"&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;♥ Jammer work with Landborough and Goldginger ♥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-20811" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/06/jammers.png" alt="jammers" width="437" height="336"&gt; &lt;em&gt;"Our league has really benefited from specific jammer drills and discussions on how to approach the Star. Being able to share our experiences not only on a skills level but also a coaching level is a really exciting prospect! We'll work you hard but it'll be worth it!"&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;♥ Footwork with Liston ♥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone  wp-image-16584" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/03/laura-liston.png" alt="Laura Liston" width="271" height="355"&gt; &lt;em&gt;"The building blocks for good wall work always starts with footwork! Lateral movement, recaptures and even jammer work relies on skaters having a strong base of footwork! I'm hoping to break down some of the more daunting skills for skaters to work on before bringing them into the wall! If you're stronger as one, you're stronger together."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to on skates tickets selling out on the first day, the DRG have added extra off skates spectator tickets to allow more to attend! Spectators will be welcomed in discussions of skills and drills throughout the day, to ask questions to any of the coaches as well as take notes, pictures and videos. As this bootcamp is aimed at post/pre mins, the coaches are hoping that skaters will take their newly polished skills back to their leagues to extend the learning process around Scotland (and further afield!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt; DRG's&lt;em&gt; Silvery Tayzers&lt;/em&gt; will be building on their win from last months Seaside Sirens game &lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/91484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;[FTS]&lt;/a&gt; by taking on Leicestershire's &lt;em&gt;Dolly Rockit Rollers&lt;/em&gt;!
&lt;p&gt;As always with Dundee double headers, DRG's B team, the &lt;em&gt;Bonnie Colliders,&lt;/em&gt; will be taking to the track first to face off against the Scarborough Slammers! After a strong season opener against Arcadia Roller Derby [&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89734/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;FTS&lt;/a&gt;], as part of &lt;em&gt;Shepsk8: For Pulmonary Fibrosis,&lt;/em&gt; the Colliders will be looking to stand out in their first home game this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two roller derby games will be alongside the usual merch and vendors stalls, including businesses from the local community. As well as the forever popular Cake Stall, boasting sweet and savoury choices! DRG are hoping to run a few hook-a-duck games and a tombola!&lt;/p&gt;

The full list of new members can be found in the press release &lt;a href="https://wftda.com/wftda-adds-9-new-members/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leagues announced included members from across the United States, South America and more in line with our reporting: Europe! On the back of four skaters making the Team Scotland squad; Dundee Roller Girls becomes only the third league in Scotland to receive this graduated status!  Interestingly enough, Tenerife Roller Derby, the hosts of the &lt;a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/12/15/tenerife-roller-derby-bringing-the-heat-to-winter-tournaments/" target="_blank"&gt;December tournament &lt;/a&gt;that featured the Dundee side, have also graduated to full WFTDA membership!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently&lt;i&gt; (as of March 2017) &lt;/i&gt;399 WFTDA member leagues and 54 leagues in the WFTDA Apprentice program globally. Leagues joining these ranks enjoy benefits including the ability to compete in sanctioned games, discussions with other member leagues and access to learning resources for skaters and officials. Dundee Roller Girls begin their WFTDA membership a Class C member and we caught up with the leagues co chairs, &lt;strong&gt;Laura Liston #07&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Crown Jewels #67&lt;/strong&gt;, for a chance to learn a bit the history of DRG and what the future holds for this up and coming league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids="16584,16583" type="circle" columns="2"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Q: Hi guys! So WFTDA full membership, a pretty huge step for a league that was skating in a car park at the back of 2009, eh?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;L: It's huge for us. I still can't quite believe we get to consider ourselves in the ranks of the incredible teams in WFTDA. Everyone has worked really hard over the years to keep our wee league together so this is a lovely reward.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CJ: Ha Ha! Yes a massive leap for us. I think it’s just amazing how we’ve managed to progress, I think most leagues probably started off in a similar fashion, a very much DIY existence. It still is (DIY) today but there is so much more awareness around derby that is does become slightly easier to progress.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: So with Dundee Roller Girls forming around 2011, you both have been involved for a long time. How have you seen the league grow in these past few years?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L: For me I think the biggest growth we've seen is when we created our B team and home teams. Giving our newer skaters the opportunity to develop and to get game experience has allowed the whole league to grow - from them getting games to our new officials getting game experience at an appropriate level. So proud of them all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CJ: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;We’ve seen a lot of league members come and go, but there are still a core few that remain. Year on year we’ve continued to build a group of league members that wants to do their best for DRG, whether that’s officiating or skating. I think the drive in people is what pushes the league forward. We have so many committed members that look for the best guest coaches to come to the league, arrange challenging games for us, run the financial side of things and look to push us on to the next level. This is what has allowed the league to grow to where it is now and will continue to do so in future. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;i&gt;What was the deciding factors for you guys to pursue the WFTDA Apprenticeship program? Was it a hard decision for the league to make since it is quite a lot of work that goes into the full program?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L: It was a lot of work in terms of admin but it made sense as the next step for us. Being so isolated in Scotland, we were finding it hard to find leagues of a similar level who would travel to play us. Joining WFTDA has given us more game opportunities and more varied game offers. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CJ: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;I don’t think it was a hard decision to make, it’s something we have aspired to for a long time and again allows us to push the league forward. The deciding factor was probably looking to get us more involvement in international events, to face and learn from some of the best leagues in the world.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;i&gt;An interesting point to maybe make here is your discontinued presence in British Championships this year.. Did your decision to pursue WFTDA membership affect your attendance to Brit Champs 2017? A close miss to promotion in 2016, and a great game against Swansea held high promise for your league in the following year?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L: The main factor involved in us leaving British Champs was the organisation as a whole. Having to travel so far to each game meant we needed the organisation to be really clear and far in advance, which it wasn't for us. Our B team was also really disadvantaged by our A team's involvement in Champs as it meant their season was quite limited. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CJ: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;I think partly it did affect our decision to leave champs. We needed to try to make sure we were focusing our energies in one direction and for us, as a league on a whole, that was WFTDA.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: We have already seen your league representing internationally with the aforementioned Tenerife Tournament, are we going to see more of the Dundee crew hitting sights outside of the UK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;L: Well our officials are now travelling all over Europe for games - Spain, Sweden, Finland and Norway recently. The Colliders are also heading to Ireland this year!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CJ: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let’s hope so! My dream is to get to Vienna (my favourite city) after that I may retire! It would be great to get further afield but sometimes finances are a limiting factor in that respect.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Q: Do you have any tips for aspiring leagues, either the new leagues blossoming in Scotland or others wishing to gain WFTDA status?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;!-- I have clearly run out of good Questions.. --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;L: To go for it! WFTDA membership isn't related to wins, or scores etc. It's for leagues who want a say in the future of roller derby. The support we had to develop through Apprenticeship from Auld Reekie, Newcastle Roller Girls and our rep from Hellfire Harlots was amazing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJ: I think mainly consult other leagues for advice. We have always been helped immensely by other leagues in Scotland and across the UK and we are always willing to provide advice to other leagues. Decide on what you want your focus to be and aim for it, find out as much as you can about what you want to achieve and ensure you have committed league members willing to put in the work towards it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

On the &lt;strong&gt;3rd of April&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Manhattan Works, Dundee, &lt;/strong&gt;DRG officials are opening their doors at &lt;strong&gt;7pm &lt;/strong&gt;for a three hour bootcamp, all for a &lt;strong&gt;fiver!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-15994" src="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/03/13517416_1130444287020985_6335893209574319226_o.jpg?w=1024" alt="Courtesy: DRG" width="1024" height="768"&gt; Obligatory after bootcamp photo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year saw three instalments of this officials orientated bootcamp, inviting NSO's, Referees and anyone that wanted to expand their rules knowledge to DRG's Manhattan Works venue in Dundee. Not only do they offer the chance to learn from some of the most experienced referees in Scotland but also to try out the tiled sports court that is so common across the US derby scene!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their previous &lt;em&gt;Late n' Lite&lt;/em&gt;'&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; have covered a variety of topics to help veteran and new officials alike! The first, in 2016, covered “&lt;em&gt;Oddly phrased Skater Queries”&lt;/em&gt; and “&lt;em&gt;Official Reviews&lt;/em&gt;”; the second: “&lt;em&gt;OPR like a Pro&lt;/em&gt;” and “&lt;em&gt;Positive Self Talk!&lt;/em&gt;”; with the third covering “&lt;em&gt;Defusing Difficult Situations&lt;/em&gt;” and “&lt;em&gt;Level up your JR and OPR positioning&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids="16013,16012,16014" type="rectangular"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each mini-bootcamp consists of two 45 minute off-skate sessions, usually one broad subject is covered initially and then another role-specific focus is brought out. After which, on skates referees are given the chance to put these new skills to the test by refereeing the Dundee Roller Girls skaters in a final hour scrim!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn a bit more about the reasoning behind these bootcamps, and just have a wee catch up with some of Scotland's referees, we had a wee chat with &lt;strong&gt;Ruby RaGe (R) &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; Tiny Tearaway (T)&lt;/strong&gt; (head officials for DRG 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids="16028,16027" type="circle" columns="2"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; So to start us off, how did these bootcamps come around? Was it something that DRG officials were working on for a long time?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;R: &lt;/b&gt;I guess we started having a chat amongst the group and Righteous Oxide came up with the idea!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;T:&lt;/b&gt; I wasn’t actually part of the league when the bootcamps were first talked about. I think it was commented on that there wasn’t anything like this already in Scotland and it would be a good idea to look into it. A few months later the first bootcamp popped up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Q: There's quite a lot of you DRG officials isn't there? Do you all take it in turns for leading a session or how is it all planned?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; What tends to happen is that folks volunteer to take a session. When it comes to the ‘classroom’ stuff it’s not everyone’s bag to stand up in front of a room full of people. I think the great thing is we all bring something different to the table. This makes it really varied and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; All of the officials at DRG have their own amazing skillsets. We have a wee chat about topics for a bootcamp and usually someone volunteers to take a session on a specific subject. I was really excited to do my session on jam reffing as I can get quite passionate about it and want all the refs to love it as much as I do &lt;span style="font-family:Wingdings;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What's planned for your fourth installment then?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; Ahhh, I’m not part of the planning for this one, I'll let Tiny take this question..!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; The fourth bootcamp is probably going to be the most exciting. So far we have focused mainly on skating officials but with so many people at DRG and across all of the Scottish leagues taking an interest in the non skating side of things, we decided to make the bootcamp for skating officials as well as anyone wanting to delve into the wonderful world of nso’ing. We are delighted that the very talented &lt;em&gt;Peggy Kreugar&lt;/em&gt; from ARRG has agreed to take this session. After the theory side of things all of the officials get the chance to ref and NSO a scrim with the lovely skaters from DRG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you feel running bootcamps like these impacts the movement of Scottish Officials? Especially when specific focus is being put into our lovely NSOs?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; I think what our league is offering is very special. It’s fair to say that NSO’s are sometimes overlooked and we very much feel they are part of the big picture. Nurturing on &amp;amp; off skates officials is integral to the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; It is a bit of a laugh between the Scottish officials that DRG have all the refs in Scotland. This isn’t quite true but we are very lucky to have 10 referees who ref at different levels throughout Scotland, the rest of the uk and the rest of the world. We are a league who have an open door policy when it comes to helping anyone who wants to learn how to ref or nso. We saw the bootcamps as a way to help newer officials and newer leagues with fewer refs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there any major barriers you feel for Scottish Officials breaking through into officiating outside of bonnie Scotland or even into international derby?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; I think you have to get yourself known &amp;amp; put yourself out there. It will get harder as the pool of Officials increases but it’s good to have contacts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt;The Scottish officials are a very close community. We are always happy to help each other out and because of this I think we have built a reputation of being knowledgeable, fair and reliable. I think for a lot of newer officials it is quite daunting to start applying to events and games over the border and abroad. The advice I was given was apply to everything, get your name out there and get known. If you get rejected, although it sucks at the time there will always be more opportunities. Work hard, ask for help and be the best you can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; To finish off, do you guys wanna give us some hints to the next few bootcamps? What are your main goals for these?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; Well there will be lots of OPR training from our wonderful&lt;em&gt; Shuggs Bunny&lt;/em&gt; and of course some great insight into Jam ref’ing like a true super star from Tiny. I’ve done some of the more mental rather than physical aspects of Derby in the past (positive self-talk) and would love to do something similar again this year. We just love the fact that lots of Officials are prepared to travel some distance to attend these Boot Camps. I think we must be doing something right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, just what Rubes has said, having the next few bootcamps continuing along the same path. Looking at focused and specific learning, but at the same time making sure there is a bit of something to keep everyone interested. It is great to see that other leagues such as &lt;em&gt;Glasgow Roller Derby&lt;/em&gt; are offering more officiating events, aimed more at nso’s but also welcome refs. I think if leagues continue with these bootcamps and training sessions the future of Scottish officiating can only become stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want to polish up your NSO skills, OPR like a PRO and have some scrim time practice then DRG's Late n' Lite Bootcamp is for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doors open at&lt;strong&gt; 7pm&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Manhattan Works, Dundee.

&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids="12259,12260" type="rectangular"]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#1d2129;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Cambria, serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;So before we look forward to your tournament, we should talk about how the season has gone for you guys? You worked your way to Second place in the British Championship in T3 North, which sent you off to the play offs weekend in Newark! How was that for the team?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#1d2129;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Cambria, serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;L: &lt;/b&gt;The team have been incredible all season. as always, living in a tiny uni city, we've had a big turnover of Tayzer skaters though the season but everyone takes it in their stride (lol pun), and we've welcomed some incredible new additions to our roster. Playoffs were surreal - we didn't expect to perform so well against Swansea and for a moment panicked we'd have to go to teir 2 haha. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#1d2129;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Cambria, serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;M: &lt;/b&gt;This season has made us so proud of our team, they always go into a game with a positive attitude and a focus on performing to the best of our abilities. We went into playoffs with a view to keep our scoring differential to a minimum and just like every other game our team came together and smashed expectations! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#1d2129;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Cambria, serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;We've covered a little bit about the Tenerife Tournament in our previous interview with Crime City, how did you guys get involved with that? This is the first international away game for you guys isn't it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#1d2129;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Cambria, serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;L: &lt;/b&gt;We'd been approached by Tenerife last year but at the time British Champs had wiped us all out and the league had no travel funds. So we kept in touch and organised a game for this year as far in advance as possible! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#1d2129;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Cambria, serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;M: &lt;/b&gt;This was organised mainly through Milky &lt;em&gt;(Liston #07)&lt;/em&gt; and Ellin &lt;em&gt;(Seaton #102)&lt;/em&gt;, keeping lines of communication with other leagues open. We're so excited to have been invited over, it's a great step forward for DRG as a league!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#1d2129;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Cambria, serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How are you guys as a league preparing for all of this then, it's not just the skaters that are going as your officials are working towards this tournament as well! How is everyone getting ready to skate in the blistering heat of “winter” in the Canaries going?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#1d2129;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Cambria, serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;L: &lt;/b&gt;Our officials are always so busy, right until the end of the year. They've been all over lately - Cardiff, Helsinki, Newcastle. Obviously all good prep for the sun! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#1d2129;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Cambria, serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;I think the Tayzers are prepping by bulk buying sunscreen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#1d2129;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Cambria, serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M: &lt;/strong&gt;We are a very lucky league to have so many dedicated officials - they work tirelessly to develop their own skills and bring them back to DRG, like Milks said they've been doing a great deal of travelling lately so they're probably better prepared then the team! Most other leagues are now going into their off-season but we've asked our skaters to keep up the focus and training for this upcoming tournament, it has extended our season quite a bit but we were happy to do it. &lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#1d2129;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Cambria, serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you all set yourselves personal goals or do you have a league goal with this tournament in mind?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#1d2129;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Cambria, serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;L: &lt;/b&gt;We're going into this tournament with the same league and team goals as always - to do our best and have an awesome time. We've got a very short roster against some incredible teams, so this'll be amazing learning to take forward for the season ahead. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#1d2129;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Cambria, serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;M: &lt;/b&gt; Yup our league wide goal is to enjoy every game as much as you can and perform to the best of our ability. If we can come out of a game having supported each other and gained new learning focuses we've always won!! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#1d2129;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Cambria, serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;And just to round off, what are the plans for next year? I believe there are a few changes coming to DRG next season, possibly with a hint at more international teams?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#1d2129;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Cambria, serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L : &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;We're hoping to graduate from WFTDA Apprentice status to full members next year, so hopefully we'll get a few more trips away to sunnier climates! Or colder. We're not picky...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#1d2129;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Cambria, serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes yes next season all focuses are on WFTDA, it'll be a great learning curve for our little league and we hope it will really help us develop. We're all buzzing for our leagues future and yes hopefully some more trips!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Showcasing the skating talent from their brand new intake as well as the old veterans and favourites from the Silvery Tayzers and the Bonnie Colliders. We see three teams, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Jutesofhazzard/?fref=ts" target="_blank"&gt;Jutes of Hazzard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/jammindodgers/?fref=ts" target="_blank"&gt;Jammin' Dodgers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Press-Gangsters-246335275570905/?fref=ts" target="_blank"&gt;Press Gangsters &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;battle it out to be crowned the tournament winner!  Each team representing aspects of Dundee life and history often summed up as jam, jute and journalism.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10583" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/home-teams-logo-smaller-advert.jpeg" alt="home-teams-logo-smaller-advert" width="1200" height="628"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home Teams for DRG is a chance for old and new skaters to have some fun on track while showing off their fancy moves and skills. A great day for all the family with fake mustaches, cakes, savoury treats, hook-a-duck, fancy feet and fun on skates!&lt;/p&gt;
