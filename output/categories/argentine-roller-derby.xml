And, to add to that, this is the weekend of the annual Big Blether Scottish Roller Derby Conference, so all the leagues will be coming together there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also two-day international tournaments in Sweden, the Mexican National Division 2 Championships in Léon, Sudestada Roller Derby's debut bout in Necochea, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antes de que&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/fenix_rollerderby/"&gt;FENIX Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;organizara el próximo gran evento patagónico, un campamento de entrenamiento de 2 días dirigido por Tropical Mecánica de 2x4 Roller Derby, les pedimos que recapitularan la emocionante historia de la comunidad patagónica el año pasado.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En general es importante destacar que el Derby patagónico ha crecido muchísimo estos años gracias al trabajo fuerte que ponemos cada equipo. Me refiero a estos tipos de eventos donde podemos compartir en casa entrenamiento con una destacada jugadora del Team OSOM [del 2x4], invitando a los equipos que puedan sumarse a participar también, así ellos y nosotros nos capacitamos para seguir creciendo. En la provincia de Santa Cruz hay 4 equipos que vivimos a 400 km de distancia entre nosotros, por lo tanto jugar seguido es muy difícil porque implica mucho gasto económico.
El año de Derby patagónico empezó con un torneo en Ushuaia que tuvo un excelente nivel y por suerte fénix roller Derby de fusionó con erráticas de Calafate en un equipo llamado cruz del sur y pudimos participar. Después tuvimos un bootcamp en caleta olivia una ciudad ubicada a 600 o 700 km de nuestro río Gallegos, pudimos participar también, finalizando el encuentro con un partido mixto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En cuanto a actividad de nosotros fueron los únicos eventos a los cuales pudimos asistir. Para el año que viene tenemos proyectados más viajes para participar a nivel nacional en torneos grandes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In general, it is important to highlight that Patagonian Derby has grown a lot in recent years thanks to the hard work that we put in from every team. I mean, these types of events where we can share bootcamps at home with an outstanding player from [2x4's] Team OSOM, inviting the teams that can Join to participate as well, so they and we are trained to continue growing. In the province of Santa Cruz, there are 4 teams that live 400 km away between us, therefore playing often is very difficult because it involves a lot of economic expense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This year of Patagonian Derby began with a tournament in Ushuaia that had an excellent level and, luckily, Phoenix Roller Derby merged with Calafate's Erráticas in a team called "Cruz del Sur" and we were able to participate. Then, we had a bootcamp in Caleta Olivia, a city located 600 or 700 km from our Rio Gallegos where we could also participate, ending the match with a mixed match.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As for our activity, they were the only events we could attend. For next year we have more trips planned to participate nationally in large tournaments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>argentine roller derby</category><category>fenix roller derby</category><category>patagonian roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/09/fenix-patagonia-2019/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 19:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Weekend Highlights: 29 September 2019 (Sunday)</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/highlights/2019/weekendhighlights-29092019/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the Sunday (and Monday) addendum for the coming weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also switched to a better map projection (Eckert IV) for this edition, to more accurately represent the scale of the countries and continents of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

Sunday seems to be the preferred day for things in Latin America, with two events in Bogotá (including a collaboration exercise between 4 of the local leagues), one in Mexico, and the previously mentioned Patagonian bootcamp in run by Vendaval in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK, meanwhile is full of bootcamps and mini-bootcamps for all those not at British Champs over the weekend...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

Queensland's state tournament has its Grand Final this Saturday; as does British Championships, with their Playoffs deciding the winners in both divisions. There are several leagues celebrating reaching their 1st decade of existence in various ways, an exciting bootcamp in Cancùn, Mexico, and a lot of roller derby in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/vendavalrollerderby/"&gt;Vendaval Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; are one of the newer teams hailing from the Argentinian part of Patagonia, in their case, Comodoro Rivadavia. In fact, the 22nd of September will mark only their first year of existence... and for most leagues, that first year doesn't have much in it but building up. Vendaval have certainly been doing that, and they want to spend their anniversary helping do the same for the rest of the Patagonian community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Flyer for Vendaval Roller Derby's Anniversary." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/09/vendaval_flyer.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, that community has been working together as a closely-allied group, transcending team boundaries for some time now. Indeed, despite the challenges of the region, Patagonia has hosted the southern-most roller derby tournament for several years running now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, this first anniversary is also a center for more developments in this area: the anniversary event is somewhere between a bootcamp and a convocation for Patagonian leagues. As well as theoretical sessions on dealing with injuries and proper exercise, run by coaching service &lt;em&gt;LP Deportes en Patín&lt;/em&gt;, there will also be physical training sessions, and a large shared lunch designed to encourage sharing and connection between the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Collaboration is essential, but holding games also needs infrastructure and resources. Vendaval will be hosting the first ever public exploration of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com/short-track-roller-derby-resources/"&gt;Short Track Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;  in Argentina in aid of this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/categories/short-track-roller-derby/"&gt;written about&lt;/a&gt; before, Short Track Roller Derby is a version of the sport created by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com"&gt;Rolla Skate Club&lt;/a&gt; to enable derby to be played with less space, time, resources and officials than the more established versions do. As such, it's an excellent additional tool to help Roller Derby develop and progress in regions, like Patagonia, where recruitment may be harder, and finding suitable spaces for a full-size WFTDA-standard track impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vendaval Roller Derby's birthday event will start at &lt;strong&gt;9am&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;22nd September&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be hosted at:
&lt;em&gt;Club In. Luis A. Huergo, Av. del Libertador 450, Comodoro Rivadavia, Chubut, Argentina&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>argentine roller derby</category><category>latin american roller derby</category><category>rolla skate club</category><category>short track roller derby</category><category>vendaval roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/09/Vendaval_shorttrack/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2019 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Weekend Highlights: 15 September 2019 (Sunday)</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/highlights/2019/weekendhighlights-15092019/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the Sunday addendum of exciting highlights this weekend. We have a double dose of action in Argentina, with Indias Roller Derby of Quilmes, and recently Continental Cup winners, Sailor City Rollers both hosting multi-bout events! There's also excitement in Scotland, as the selection bout for Men's World Cup team, Power of Scotland is on in Dundee... and we have a Tuesday event in Slovenia as Roller Derby Ljuljana screen Whip it! for Pride!&lt;/p&gt;

There's also a bunch of open scrimmages across the world, especially in the UK; and in Chile there's an open-subscription variant rules event which looks quite interesting (and tiring...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;
