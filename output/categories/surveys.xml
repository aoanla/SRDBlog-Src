However, with a standard WFTDA-rules bout needing at least 90 minutes (and preferably 2 hours) blocked in for it, and around 14+ officials if fully-staffed, hosting large numbers of teams can be tricky, especially if you want a tournament structure capable of providing a "winner".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, there's a huge number of alternative rules for shorter game formats, thus allowing more games per day, and more teams per tournament: from the 2 minute games of Sur5al, through 21 minute Derby Sevens [both with reduced rosters too], through various ad-hoc 30, 40 and 45 minute modifications of the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few of the above bout systems change much about the rules of the game beyond timing (and sometimes roster restrictions) - they all take the same number of officials as WFTDA standard games.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Victory or Valhalla&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26720" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/05/screen-shot-2018-05-17-at-12-05-06.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-05-17 at 12.05.06" width="801" height="792"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/waterfordcityviqueens/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waterford City Viqueens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Waterford's oldest Roller Derby league, wanted to promote Roller Derby in their city (and in Ireland) by hosting a 6 team tournament, with teams from across Eire and beyond. For a small league; in this case, just 25 members; hosting a 10 game tournament is challenging not just in terms of time, but also officiating resources. As Macks, for the Viqueens notes, "As Ireland is so small (in general, not just in derby land) securing officials was one of the toughest aspects of organising the tournament, we all know that without them...... THERE IS NO DERBY!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also the Viqueens' first event on this scale, so they also had to work on solving all of the large tournament problems - food, water, changing rooms, scheduling and so on - for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cope with these additional pressures, the league decided to make a more radical choice of ruleset: adopting the &lt;strong&gt;2017 PivotStar Rules&lt;/strong&gt;. To the best of our knowledge, Victory or Valhalla is the first tournament outside of North America where the PivotStar rules have been applied.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;PivotStar Rules&lt;/h4&gt;
The "PivotStar Rules" originated at the 2017 edition of &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/265489690551917/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best of the West&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Canadian tournament. Tournament sponsors and co-organisers, PivotStar, wanted to provide a more competitive format for large-scale contests, whilst &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; reducing the amount of overhead needed for officials.
PivotStar owner, Luludemon, has explained the reasoning behind the design in more detail on her blog here: [&lt;a href="https://pivotstar.com/best-of-the-west-roller-derby-tournament/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LINK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;].
&lt;p&gt;The executive summary of &lt;strong&gt;changes&lt;/strong&gt; [and reasoning] might look something like:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20 minute games / no timeouts&lt;/strong&gt; [reduced time / more games]&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 point per &lt;em&gt;pass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; [reduces load on officials/reduces need for jam referees, reduces "lead jammer advantage"]&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track cuts relative to track, not opposing players&lt;/strong&gt; [reduces load on officials, keeps game moving forwards]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The reduction of effort provided by the latter two rules changes also allows a reduced number of referees and NSOs: PivotStar suggest having only only &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt; referees total per game (two inside and two outside), plus a single "score tracking NSO" to indicate when either jammer has completed a pass, and reduced NSOs in other positions. In testing, Waterford Viqueens determined that they needed a few more officials to help things move smoothly, so their setup assigned two score tracking NSOs (one per team) and an additional NSO for the penalty box timers, for a total of just&lt;em&gt; 11&lt;/em&gt; officials for each game!
&lt;p&gt;The tournament itself, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/339727839871496/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victory or Valhalla&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was organised as 2 group stages (of three teams each, unseeded), into placement bouts - a single 5th place bout for the lowest teams in each group, and a 4 team single elimination for the top 2 in each group. This gave every team a minimum of 3 games, and a maximum of 4 (for the finalists).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
An obvious effect of the 1 point per pass rule is that scores are a quarter to a fifth as high as equivalent scores from WFTDA rules games of the same duration, as you can see below (Limerick forfeited the final against Belfast, so a bonus game was played between 3rd place (on points) Angoulême and Belfast):
&lt;table style="border:0;"&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt; &lt;col&gt; &lt;col style="width:2.3em;"&gt; &lt;col style="width:1em;"&gt; &lt;col style="width:2.3em;"&gt; &lt;col&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Other than Belfast topping Limerick (due to Limerick forfeiting), this reproduces the FTS European rankings of the teams competing: these results are not in FTS as yet, as they're non-standard ruleset.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Feedback&lt;/h3&gt;
Any tournament which runs on time and has no major issues is a successful tournament... but how did the attendees react to the new format for Victory or Valhalla?
&lt;p&gt;Waterford City Viqueens performed a survey of attendees to measure just that, and have generously shared a summary of the results with us, on which we base this part of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all surveys of a population, there are conflicting opinions, with some people praising aspects which others disliked (for example, the summary highlights responses complaining that 20 minute games were a little short, alongside several responses lauding the short games for allowing so many games to be packed into a single day tournament). On a purely qualitative measure, then, response to the PivotStar format might be considered mixed, as skaters mentioning it were either confused by the rules, or, conversely, found them simpler.
(By contrast, officials only &lt;em&gt;positively&lt;/em&gt; mentioned the rules being simpler + more predictable, with complaints more towards the reduction in the number of officials on track.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more quantitative measure, though, the feeling is &lt;em&gt;unambiguously&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt;. Given the chance to rate various aspects of the tournament on a 5 point scale, every single aspect received a mean and median rating between 5 and 4; and no aspect had any 0 ratings at all.
Most promisingly, 100% of responding Skaters and Officials both found the tournament "worthwhile" and said that they would recommend it to others. The Viqueens pulled out a particularly positive quote from one (anonymous) respondent: "Seriously this was a fantastic event and should be a yearly thing. Like an Irish roller con: ye should be really proud of yourselves for pulling it off so well!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-26728 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/05/screen-shot-2018-05-18-at-10-21-36.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-05-18 at 10.21.36" width="540" height="614"&gt; Survey data collated by Waterford Viqueens, made available to us on request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting aspect emerging from the more detailed questions was the not inconsiderable number of officials interested in the tournament primarily &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of the different ruleset.  22% of officials (compared to 11% of skaters) chose this as their reason, when only allowed to pick a single response. (The majority of skaters prized the ability to compete in multiple games as their reason, 73% of skaters saying so; officials were more split, with no really clear majority out of "location", "multiple games" and "rule set".)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Viqueens' part, the event was an overall success, both in terms of organisation: "The schedule was reliable and well kept to; we went over time a little before lunch, but the break allowed us to catch up", and in terms of the social effect; "The amount of derby teams was great: people got to meet different teams and play teams they hadn't played before [which] created a great sense of community".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The league, of course, pay tribute to all those necessary for the event to exist, noting that "The announcers were fantastic, [and] the Refs and NSOs did a great job and helped everything run super smoothly".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, media seems to have been the only thing that could be improved, with a Tournament Group Photo one of the things that the league would like to ensure happens next time. (We'd also recommend a group photo for the officials, the announcers, and the volunteers, as well!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd love to see more tests of the PivotStar Rules elsewhere (with the permission of PivotStar, of course - although we know Luludemon is personally excited to see people using the ruleset in general, it's always nice to ask); and we look forward to more tournaments from Waterford Viqueens in future!&lt;/p&gt;

As Roller Derby spreads out of the "cultural West", the new areas it encounters have potential to enrich the sport, as well as bringing the usual benefits of enthusiastic new areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, what do newer skaters in those regions think about Roller Derby right now? How do they feel about the sport - and what do they want from it?
To start off an irregular series on this topic, we performed a small survey with several Roller Derby teams and leagues in Asia and the Middle and Near East, targeting specifically skaters who were local to those areas. Future articles in this series will talk to some of the respondents to the survey, and others, in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responding skaters were members of: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Roller-Derby-Beirut-763063127094159/"&gt;Roller Derby Beirut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Beirut), &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/TLVDerbyGirls/?fref=ts"&gt;Tel Aviv Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Israel), &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/NRMonsters/?fref=ts"&gt;Tokyo Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Neon Roller Monsters, Japan), &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/kamikazebadassrollerderbyjapan/?fref=ts"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kamikaze Badass Roller Derby&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;(Japan),  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BangkokRollerDerby/?fref=ts"&gt;Bangkok Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Thailand), and the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/CaiRollergirls/?fref=ts"&gt;CaiRollers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Egypt). Other leagues were asked, but were unable to respond due to issues outside their control. In total, there were &lt;strong&gt;15&lt;/strong&gt; respondents. We should emphasise that, with such a small survey, proportions are subject to significant statistical uncertainty - differences of less than 20% in response are not statistically significant here. Whilst all of the respondents waived their right to anonymity in this survey, we will not be identifying them at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median experience of the skaters was &lt;strong&gt;3 years&lt;/strong&gt;, with only one having less than a years' declared experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started off the survey by investigating how they got involved with their current league. 7, &lt;strong&gt;47%&lt;/strong&gt;, of respondents referred to finding out through friends, either online (Facebook or otherwise) or in person. One was led to join after reading an article about the league, and one via advertising in public spaces. The remainder were founding members of their league, or otherwise did not answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9602" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-17-at-21-23-02.png?w=273" alt="screen-shot-2016-10-17-at-21-23-02" width="273" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, a little over half had heard of Roller Derby before joining their league. Of the &lt;strong&gt;60%&lt;/strong&gt; who had heard of Roller Derby from other venues, there were precisely two touchstones, each with &lt;strong&gt;43%&lt;/strong&gt; of the eligible cohort: the movie "Whip It", and experiences of the sport in other countries - the UK or USA; one did not give a detailed response. Most did not find their experience of roller derby to differ from their expectations, although one explicitly noted that the experience was better than the film made out (less "sexy" and more "down to earth").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9813" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-19-at-13-23-13.png" alt="screen-shot-2016-10-19-at-13-23-13" width="826" height="395"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most respondents feel more of a part of a "&lt;em&gt;worldwide community&lt;/em&gt;" and "&lt;em&gt;aware of Roller Derby outside their country&lt;/em&gt;" than not. However, the positivity is more muted on the latter point, with the most common response being around the middle of the scale; contrastingly, 40% feel "completely" part of a worldwide community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also asked respondents two questions to see how they did interact with the worldwide community: "&lt;em&gt;How do you feel about Roller Derby worldwide?&lt;/em&gt;" and "&lt;em&gt;What do the letters WFTDA mean to you?&lt;/em&gt;"
On the former question, 4 did not respond in any way. The statistically significant majority of responses (53%, &lt;strong&gt;72%&lt;/strong&gt; of those who answered at all) were both positive and reflected ideals of community - common words were "one family", "sisterhood", "inspirational" and "capable". Only one respondent expressed a complete lack of knowledge about the wider community.
On the latter question, two respondents (&lt;strong&gt;13%&lt;/strong&gt;) did not know what WFTDA was. Of the remainder, 4 (&lt;strong&gt;26%&lt;/strong&gt;) focussed on the standards setting aspects of the Association, while another 5 (&lt;strong&gt;33%&lt;/strong&gt;) expressed mainly aspirational or community related feeling towards it. (The rest simply repeated the exact meaning).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-large wp-image-9582 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-17-at-19-59-15-2.png?w=1024" alt="screen-shot-2016-10-17-at-19-59-15-2" width="1024" height="540"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also interested as to how the respondents viewed Roller Derby - is it "&lt;em&gt;American&lt;/em&gt;" or "&lt;em&gt;Western&lt;/em&gt;" or both? Responses to both questions were mixed, and not well correlated, suggesting that images of "America" and "The West" are not close synonyms. However, there is a definite trend towards believing that Roller Derby is more Western than not, whilst the feelings about "Americanness" are more mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To judge influence of wider and popular Roller Derby images, we asked the respondents if they had any Roller Derby heroes.
4 (&lt;strong&gt;27%&lt;/strong&gt;) said that they had no heroes, or raised philosophical objections to the concept. Several mentioned more than one choice, so percentages here do not add up to 100%: the most popular choices were Quadzilla (3, &lt;strong&gt;20%&lt;/strong&gt;), Bonnie Thunders (2, &lt;strong&gt;13%&lt;/strong&gt;) and "our league/our coaches" (3, &lt;strong&gt;20%&lt;/strong&gt;). Highly visible WFTDA Top 40 skaters are represented in 7 (&lt;strong&gt;47%&lt;/strong&gt;) of responses overall, a majority of responses for those who had any heroes at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also asked if respondents thought that &lt;em&gt;the kind of Roller Derby they did was different in any way to "Western" Roller Derby&lt;/em&gt; (if this existed as a thing).
&lt;strong&gt;33%&lt;/strong&gt; of respondents answered with a simple "&lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;". Of the rest, three (&lt;strong&gt;20%&lt;/strong&gt;) essentially abstained, and the remainder were divided into &lt;strong&gt;20%&lt;/strong&gt; "&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;", and the remainder mostly concerned with the relative skill gap they perceived. (Two (&lt;strong&gt;13%&lt;/strong&gt;) did consider the difference to be in relation to the perspective of society towards their sport).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-9814 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/screen-shot-2016-10-19-at-13-23-32.png" alt="screen-shot-2016-10-19-at-13-23-32" width="486" height="393"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerning local derby, we were interested as to &lt;em&gt;how their peers and family reacted&lt;/em&gt; to the sport. The majority of respondents considered their family to be &lt;em&gt;more supportive&lt;/em&gt; than not (&lt;strong&gt;80%&lt;/strong&gt;), with &lt;strong&gt;47%&lt;/strong&gt; selecting the most positive option ("&lt;em&gt;totally supportive&lt;/em&gt;"). Of those with less supportive family and friends, all of them cited concerns about physical safety as the principal sources of worry, although one of the positive respondents noted that their family's similar fears been totally reversed once they had actually seen the sport in action. (Positive respondents generally used word like "&lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;" or "&lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;" to describe their peers/family's feelings.)
With particular reference to Japan, respondents noted the confusion specific to that country between "Roller Derby" and the Japanese entertainment variant "Roller Game" in the popular consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close off the survey, we also asked respondents about &lt;em&gt;their hopes&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;fears&lt;/em&gt; for Roller Derby in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmingly, the &lt;em&gt;hopes&lt;/em&gt; consisted of desires for more popular recognition or mainstream tokens of acceptance(&lt;strong&gt;100%&lt;/strong&gt;). Breaking this down, &lt;strong&gt;20%&lt;/strong&gt; of responses specifically mentioned the Olympics as an aspirational target; &lt;strong&gt;33%&lt;/strong&gt; focussed more on increasing popularity and acceptance in their region, while another &lt;strong&gt;33%&lt;/strong&gt; had specific interest in the spread of Roller Derby to more countries worldwide. In particular, one respondent was specifically interested in having more roller derby outside of the USA, with tournaments in every region.
With respect to &lt;em&gt;fears&lt;/em&gt;, responses were far more varied. Two (&lt;strong&gt;13%&lt;/strong&gt;) had "no worries". Two were concerned about the sport's community spirit being harmed by increased professionalisation. &lt;strong&gt;33%&lt;/strong&gt; were concerned that the sport might die out - from lack of support either globally or regionally. &lt;strong&gt;20%&lt;/strong&gt; (overlapping with some of the above) were specifically concerned by costs. 1 (&lt;strong&gt;7%&lt;/strong&gt;) expressed concern at the increased influence of men in the sport.
In both cases, we believe that these are the same kinds of hopes and fears found across the Roller Derby community, even in the most established nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, then, we are encouraged by the response to our survey, especially concerning support from local and global communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, we hope to come back to you will follow-ups on this article, interviewing specific respondents (and others from leagues who were not surveyed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>international</category><category>international derby</category><category>statistics</category><category>surveys</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/10/19/international-roller-derby-survey-2016/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2016 11:22:01 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
