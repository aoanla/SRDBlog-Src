<p style="text-align:justify;">After the success of their Springtime Craft Fayre last year, <a title="Fierce Valley's Website" href="posts/2012/04/06/fvrg-presents-the-craft-emporium/www.fvrg.co.uk" target="_blank">Fierce Valley Roller Girls</a> will be treating you all again to a hand-made, home-grown Craft Emporium! The event will be held in The Masonic Temple in Falkirk on Saturday 28th April from 12noon – 4pm, and will play host to a fine selection of around 20 local arts &amp; crafts stalls. Scotland’s first Junior Roller Derby league – Fierce Valley Roller Cubs – will also be there to share their future plans and answer any questions that kids (and their parents!) may have about the sport.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fundraising team at FVRG have pulled out all the stops to make sure there will be something for everyone at The Emporium. The crafters will be offering a range of handmade goods from jewellery, to greetings cards, to scarves, and even corsets and ‘skatergirlz’ art work.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/04/craft-fayre-2012.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022" title="The Craft Emporium Poster" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/04/craft-fayre-2012.jpg" alt="The Craft Emporium Poster" width="614" height="871"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There will be an elaborate bake sale for the sweet toothed, with tea and coffee also available. If you’re feeling lucky, then why not buy a raffle tickets to be in with a shot of winning vouchers from LMG Hair &amp; Beauty, or a set of books from Litlist Book Shop, or lampwork jewellery from Scarlett Impressions or Flaming Eck?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So what's it all in aid of?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As well as keeping you entertained for the afternoon, proceeds from the FVRG stalls at the Craft Fayre will help fund Fierce Valley Roller Girls team, ‘Parma Violents’, in their next bout. This will only be their second public outing, and they will be playing away against Belfast Roller Derby! For such a young league, going to Northern Ireland to represent Scottish Roller Derby is a huge opportunity, so all support received to help fund the trip will be hugely appreciated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To keep up with the latest Craft Emporium news or to be tempted by the latest raffle prizes on offer, take a look at the <a title="The Craft Emporium Facebook Event" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/393299267360860/" target="_blank">Facebook Event</a>, or look out for our skaters on Falkirk High Street on the day – you’ll not miss them!</p>

<p>Hot off the heels of their recent bout against ARRG's Cannon Belles, Perth's FCR will host a recruitment night and scrims session.</p>
<p>Tomorrow night (Tuesday, March 27), the Fair City Rollers will hold their Fresh Meat recruitment night, open to women over 18 who want to join the team, and men over 18 who would like to referee. There isn't even any basic skating skills required, so even if the last time you were on skates they had My Little Pony on the side (like mine when I was youngster) you can come along and give it a try.</p>
<p>The Fresh Meat session will be held in Bell's Sports Centre from 7pm to 8pm. Anyone interested in coming along should email faircityrollersrecruitment@gmail.com so that the league can bring along their spare kit.</p>
<p>And immediately after Fresh Meat, FCR will host an open Scottish mixed scrims, where some of the best skaters from around the country will meet and play together. Scrims will be held between 8pm and 10pm.</p>
<p>FCR chairperson Terryfying Tink said: "It's a great opportunity for skaters from all scottish leagues to get together, to learn from each other and have some fun."</p>
<p>FCR hopes to see lots of skaters there!!</p>

<div><strong>What first attracted you to Roller Derby?</strong></div>

<p><br></p>
<div><span style="color:#000000;">I hadn't heard of Roller Derby (yes I know, I lead a sheltered life!) before seeing 'Whip it', after watching I cursed living in Inverness where we never have anything decent to do and what do you know, a couple of months later it appeared in a local mag. I am not really a sporty type and RD just appealed to me because it looked such fun and a good way of getting fit without having to wear a leotard or running shoes!</span></div>
<br><div><strong>Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when\you're starting out. How did you choose your name, and how does it reflect your personality on track?</strong></div>
<br><div><span style="color:#ff0000;"><span style="color:#000000;">My name was the result of hours of err well, nothing! I could not think of any names that I liked or suited me, my hubby was coming up with some crackers but I am not sure my team mates would have liked shouting them out on the track! I ended up coming up with Bee-Yatch and obviously its a play on 'Bitch' but I actually play more on the Bee aspect as I wear yellow stripey socks, my helmet has Bee stripes on it and I can be a little 'stingy' if necessary!</span>
</span></div>
<br><div><strong>What was your biggest initial difficulty?</strong></div>
<br><div>
<span style="color:#000000;">My biggest difficulty was making my legs and feet do as they were told! I felt a bit like Bambi but in time have manged to overcome that (just!). I also had the concern that I was going to spend a lot of money on the initial gear layout and then might end up not liking it but thankfully that hasn't happened.</span>
</div>
<br><div><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about theirnew sport. How have you been spreading the word?</span></strong></div>
<br><div><span style="color:#000000;">I talk constantly about RD to anyone who will listen, in fact they don't even have to listen as long as they pretend!! ;-)</span></div>
<br><div><strong>What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/done this month?</strong></div>
<br><div>
<span style="color:#000000;">Endurance, endurance, endurance...and it really works. We have been putting a lot of effort into the basics and it has paid off. Personally I think it really helped me and got me through my 25 in 5 as without it I would never had made it within the time.</span>
</div>
<br><div><strong>What were the most difficult and best things you’ve done?</strong></div>
<br><div><span style="color:#000000;">For me getting over the nerves of being in a pack situation was quite difficult, I tend to over think things and wondered how I would ever get the nerve up to be able to get through a pack. Now when we do it I still get nervous but I use that energy to spur me on and I don't even think about what my feet are doing which is great. The best thing is being part of the team, we all help each other and encourage each other and everyone on the team wants NNRG to progress and become a team to lookout for.</span></div>
<br><div>
<strong>What’s new in NNRG?</strong>
</div>
<br><div>We have a couple of girls who are almost passed their MINs which is fantastic, we are also recruiting fresh meat and have had quite a bit of interest so hopefully we will be expanding again pretty soon. We seem to have come really far in the last 2 months and it feels great.</div>
