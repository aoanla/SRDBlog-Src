<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is traditional, we’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"><span class="s2"><b>Flat Track Stats</b></span></a> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <strong><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). We're working toward our August SRDRank release, which we expect to come out before the next of these posts. (SRDRank also has recent WFTDA rankings, including the 31st June ranking, as well as SRDRank, and allows you to make predictions from them.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]</span></p>

<p>We've been a little remiss with our <a href="https://www.britishchamps.com"><strong>British Champs</strong></a> Northern Divisions updates since the middle of the season, so we're back a with a special catchup with our teams from each Tier, continuing with Tier 3's Granite City Roller Derby!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-22709" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/07/gcrd.png?w=300" alt="GCRD" width="300" height="300"> GCRD!</p>
<p>Granite City's Northern Fights had an exceptional 2016 in Champs, entering Tier 3 in 2017 by promotion after topping the table. They've continued their excellent Champs performance in Tier 3 - they currently top the table here as well, unbeaten, with extremely strong victories in 3 of 4 of their games so far. (The only close game was their first, against Halifax's Bruising Banditas.)
The rest of the Tier 3 Champs table is more even at the moment with, tentatively, Auld Reekie's Reserves and the newly-rebranded North Wales Roller Derby in the most likely places to take the second top spot. We'll know more after the second-last fixtures of the Tier, today, hosted by North Wales, with the final bouts happening August in Edinburgh as Auld Reekie host.</p>
<p>Northern Fights co-Captain, Berocca Bama had the following to say: "2017 Tier 3 North has been a very exciting and challenging time for the Northern Fights of GCRD. As a result of hard training and solid dedication of the players and league, we have really grown and bonded as a team since Tier 4 in 2016 which meant we felt strong to compete in Tier 3 North 2017 and the results so far are far beyond our wildest dreams.</p>
<p>We have had so many enjoyable games, the most thrilling of which was against ARRG B. The team that ended our winning streak in 2016, we knew ARRG were going to be really tough opponents. We are sure anyone who was there to see this Champs game would agree it was a nail biter to the end!</p>
<p>We are looking forward to playing the Furness Firecrackers in the final Champs game in August; we know they'll bring it! It's a very important game for us, as a victory here should see us through to play-offs, if our maths is right..."</p>
<p>Granite City are also hosting events outside of Champs, starting with their very own tournament in a weeks time, the <strong>29th</strong> of <strong>July</strong>! <strong>Scottish Sevens</strong> will be the most heptamerous of Sevens tournaments, with seven co-ed/OTA teams competing, each with the traditional seven skaters, in 21 minute games.</p>
<p>And after Champs Tier 3 North comes to an end in August (except for the Tier 3 promotion playoffs, 16/17 September), the Northern Fights will be hosting 2 games of their own, up in Aberdeen. These will also be great opportunities to see GCRD's B team, the Fight Hawks, as both events are double headers!
We don't have dates for these events yet, but of course we will feature them as soon as we have more information...</p>

<p>We've been a little remiss with our <a href="https://www.britishchamps.com"><strong>British Champs</strong></a> Northern Divisions updates since the middle of the season, so we're back a with a special catchup with our teams from each Tier, starting with Tier 4 North's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yorkrollerderby/"><strong>York Minxters</strong></a>!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22663" src="2017/07/10858530_804241242955870_3874820604520383031_n.jpg" alt="10858530_804241242955870_3874820604520383031_n" width="462" height="527"> York Minxters Logo (Credit: York Minxters)</p>
<p>As the season is closing out, the Minxters will be playing their last bout of their Division of the Tier on <strong>July 29th</strong>. With three teams in the Division all with a single win (York, Grimsby and Durham Roller Derby), this bout will play an important part in deciding the final table ordering. Hosts Durham Roller Derby will play their fellow Durhamites, Durham City Rolling Angels, in the other decisive bout in the fixture (Wakey Wheeled Cats play Mansfield in the third bout... but Wakefield can't be knocked off the top spot according to the Champs table - and <em>both</em> teams will be promoted to Tier 3 regardless, as they have an unassailable grip on the top 2 places).</p>
<p>Minxters Captain Gem O'Cide is excited about the bout, "Our final Champs game on July 29th is a triple header. We take on our lovely friends Grimsby and its a game we have been looking forward to - it's d always hard to hit the ones you love.. and I think war paint will be caked on so we can ignore the smiles... as a team we have decided on a theme.. AND we don't do things by halves!".</p>
<p>And the rest of the team will be celebrating surviving their first ever tournament series the day after, <strong>July 30th</strong>, with a closed, mixed scrim for skaters from all the teams in Tier 4 North, as well as other "Tier 4 level" teams.
The Minxters describe it as a "celebration of everything we've achieved competing in our first championships", "a super casual affair full of fun and welcoming newer skaters, refs and officials to mark the end of champs and the start of the next season".
Any skaters of the right level who are interested in joining in should do so quickly, as the event is almost at capacity.</p>
<p>After recovering from this, the celebrations won't stop for York Minxters: a month later, August 20th, they'll be giving fans the chance to see the rising stars of the next season, as their last fresh meat intake hold their debut exhibition bout... as well as a "meet and greet" after the bout, for those interested in signing up themselves.</p>
<p>An open-subscription bout for all rookie skaters, this has proven so popular that skater tickets sold out in just 3 days - although there is a reserve list for those still interested. The team are still looking for a full officiating crew, so Referees and NSOs are welcomed!
Gem O'Cide adds, "The theme is Disney vs Superhero* and we sold out much faster than we expected -  which we are super happy with; we're already planning part two! The current rostered skaters have a chance to bench and NSO to thank all the intake for all their hard work over the last 6 months.
These are just our first planned off-season scrims.. there will be much more from the Minxters in the rest of 2017!"</p>

<p>Dundee Roller girls' are hosting their second home game this season as a single header! On the <strong>22nd of July </strong>at the <strong>D.I.S.C.</strong> <strong>Dundee</strong>, the Bonnie Colliders are taking on Bairn City (&amp; pals!) which looks to be a mighty match! With doors opening at <strong>12:30 </strong>and first whistle coming in at <strong>1pm,</strong> it's gonna be a short and sweet single header. Differing from DRG's usual doubles hitters,  these two familiar sides will most certainly make the trip worth while!</p>
<p><img class="  wp-image-22412 aligncenter" src="2017/07/19621172_1505774156154661_5391157900722134871_o.jpg" alt="Photo Courtesy: Laura MacDonald" width="520" height="736">
We thought we would catch up with the Bonnie Colliders Co Captains for 2017, <strong>Breezy Does It #289</strong> and <strong>HullabaLou #17</strong>, to learn a bit more about leading and shaping a B team!</p>
<p>[gallery ids="22420,22421" type="circle" columns="2"]</p>
<p><b>Q1: How has the season gone so far for you guys? You've have a few games already and you seem to come out strong both sides.
</b></p>
<p><strong>Breezy:  </strong><em>This season has been amazing so far, we've played those two games and won both, which is super exciting! The team is really starting to gel together and we are getting better every time we play. We've had a few newer skaters join us and they are coming on great and are fitting in well with the team.</em></p>
<p><strong>HullabaLou: </strong><em>It's just been so epic this season, I am so so proud of everyone! To see our wee team taking the skills that we drill together every week at training and scrims, and put them into practice during games is fantastic – whether it’s fancy new toe stop spins, some super controlled one-one blocking or crushing offense; the commitment and effort from every person on the team is something that I respect hugely and do not take for granted as a Captain.</em></p>
<p><b>Q2: And so the Colliders have played a Bairn side a few times, with the most recent in 2015 </b><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/71209" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[FTS]</a><b>. How does that change your look on this match-up?</b></p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> <em>I was off on maternity for all of 2015 so unfortunately wasn't part of the team on that one but I was there for the previous year and it was such a tough game! Bairn have continued to grow so much since then, really we're looking at them as a brand new opponent. Which for a lot of our Colliders this season - they will be!</em></p>
<p><strong>H:</strong> <em>The 2015 game</em><em>,</em><em> was one of the firsts for quite a few of us who had just been rostered for the B team, and was definitely quite an experience for us haha! Bairn are so lovely and we genuinely can’t wait to play them again, but will definitely be needing as many of our Collidoscopes (our loyal fans) to support us as possible!</em></p>
<p><b>Q3: How do you guys approach a game when you are captaining, what goes through your mind?
</b>
<strong>B:</strong> <em>I approach all games in a similar manner, nervous anticipation! The difference as a Co-Captain is that I like to check in with all the skaters to find out how they're feeling, as Lou and I want each skater to enjoy themselves and feel comfortable on game day. </em></p>
<p><strong>H:</strong> <strong><em>A</em></strong><em>ll we want as Captains is to ensure our team has an absolute blast on game day, I just want to help them smash their goals and whip out those hard-practiced skills! Colliders are definitely all about soaking up the sheer enjoyment of simply playing roller derby together! To quote our wonderful co-chair Milky “It’s just a made-up game on roller skates” and so I try to focus on that…we are from Fundee after all.</em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><b>Q4: With the Silvery Tayzers (Dundee's A team) getting quite a lot of focus now with the league being full WFTDA members, do you feel that adds more pressure for you guys, or is it the opposite and you loose some track time as a B team?</b></p>
<p><strong>B: </strong><em>DRG train as a league, first and foremost. We all skate together. We have skaters who've just passed their minimum skills alongside our Team Scotland skaters. It is a huge benefit to all our skaters as we work together to push each other on in every aspect. As a team, the Colliders do get lots of track time together to work as a unit, and practice our tactics and skills, but training alongside the Silvery Tayzers really pushes us out of our comfort zones and helps us develop further. </em></p>
<p><strong>H: </strong><em>DRG definitely think of ourselves as a league rather than 2 teams – we train together, scrim together and thoroughly support each other; the success of the Tayzers and their sweeeeet wftda ranking (266th!)</em> <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[16/07/2017 FTS]</a><em> has only boosted our league spirit. And likewise when the Colliders smash it, the mad support from the rest of the league is just unparalleled. Personally, that’s one of the things I love most about DRG: Our wonderful bouting committee have always placed an equal importance on getting games for both Colliders and Tayzers….so short answer – no, we never lose track time!</em></p>
<p><b>Q5: With that in mind, what do you guys aim for, for yourselves and your team? It must be hard to maintain such a close-knit team, with skaters moving on to the A team or with the new intake coming up.
</b></p>
<p><strong>B: </strong><em> My aim is to work alongside all of our current skaters and those moving up from the new skater programme to encourage them to practice in the hopes that our team can grow stronger. As for keeping the team close knit, I think that comes from our training atmosphere. Lou and I are very open in terms of communication and encourage skaters to bring any issues to us in the hopes that everyone feels driven but not pushed, as being a Collider is always about having the best experience possible and taking away as much as you can from both training, scrimmage and game days!</em></p>
<p><strong>H: </strong><em>I think that as a team we definitely drive ourselves forward and regardless of experience-level our training committee has always worked us hard to constantly improve our play. Being a B team, the roster is a lot more dynamic; newer skaters come up, more experienced skaters move to the A team, and it changes a lot. We do actively focus on learning how each other blocks/jams so can we gel on track but because we all train together, even when a skater does reach a certain level experience and makes that tough decision to bout exclusively with the A team, it doesn’t really feel like we’ve lost them because we'll be drilling/scrimming with them the week after anyways. Saying that we did have a very emotional locker-room-team-cry after a speech from last season’s stepping down Captains… but I think that just goes to show how much we bond as a team…or perhaps how emotionally unstable a bunch of us are…possibly both.</em></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is traditional, we’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"><span class="s2"><b>Flat Track Stats</b></span></a> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <strong><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). Our new SRD Rank for July is out (pending updates as late scores trickle into FTS), with the usual map mode, score predictions and the rest, for all teams in the world. (It also has some WFTDA rankings, including the 31st June ranking, as well as SRDRank.)</span></p>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/granitecitybrawlers/"><strong>Granite City Brawlers</strong></a> (GCB) are preparing for their next game. This one promises to be extra special, not only is this the first Brawlers game outside of Scotland BUT it's also the first Brawlers game outside of the U.K.! The Brawlers are heading to Tenerife to play against <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Tibicenas-Mens-Roller-Derby-796092177146242/"><strong>Tibicenas Men's Roller Derby</strong></a> (TMRD).
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22166" src="2017/07/img_0039.jpg" alt="" width="724" height="1024"> Bout Poster courtesy of Tibicenas Men's Roller Derby</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to check  in with captains Pudz and Momo to ask about how the team are preparing for their next game.</p>
<p>TMRD have previously played Madrid MadRiders but despite some serious snooping, I can't find any teams to link GCB to TMRD. Since this makes it super hard to make any predictions about the game, there is additional excitement. [<a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html"><strong>SRDRank</strong></a> gives the Brawlers the advantage over their hosts, but with low certainty - Ed.]</p>
<p><i>You played Oldham earlier this year and were victorious, how are you feeling about taking on Tibicenas Men's Roller Derby? </i><i>Have you seen them play before or met any of the players during your World Cup experiences?</i></p>
<p><b>Pudz</b></p>
<p>Nervous but excited at the same time. We've scoured the internet for footage to watch but come up short so are going into this game a little bit blind as to our opponent's style. Unless you count their uploads of the T Rex on skates, if the dinosaur gets rostered we'll be facing a new challenge!</p>
<p><b>Momo</b></p>
<p>We trained really hard on the run up to the Oldham game, I think we stepped up drastically from our previous game last year. We went back through the previous game and pin-pointed every weakness and focused heavily on certain aspects that were lacking; we're not perfect yet but the guys really worked hard and for the first time at the Oldham game we had in all sense's of the word: a team.</p>
<p>Tenerife is a complete wild card! None of us know what to expect from the team and I think a lot of the guys are underestimating how hot it's going to be; myself and Pudz have a good idea how hard it's going to be after playing in Canada [at MRDWC] last year. TMRD will have the advantage being used to playing in the heat, and I think we are only playing with 9* so it's going to be seriously tough. Whatever happens we'll do all we can do and have fun knowing we have a holiday after the game as well.</p>
<p>We haven't seen the roster yet and I'm not sure if anyone played in the World Cup but it's obviously quite possible.</p>
<p>*GCB will now be playing with 10 skaters</p>
<p><i>Tell me about your fundraising efforts to get the team and crew over to Tenerife </i></p>
<p><b>Pudz</b></p>
<p>Five of our Brawlers are doing a sponsored leg wax to help cover the costs of skater insurance and the bus to the game in Tenerife. Whichever Brawler has the most money against their name will be getting a nice pre holiday leg wax. #waxonwaxbrawff</p>
<p>Whoever has the highest funds against them is going to have an itchy time in the crazy heat!</p>
<p><a href="2017/07/img_0038-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22170" src="2017/07/img_0038-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576"></a>
<a href="http://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/waxonwaxbrawff">http://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/waxonwaxbrawff</a></p>
<p><i>What sort of special preparation are you doing as a team/individual for playing in such a super warm place?</i></p>
<p><b>Pudz</b></p>
<p>The team have been doing "jumper scrims" in preparation for the game to try and adjust to the heat. These have been met with sad faces from our peely wally Brawlers but have been good fun and shown off Raffers' fine selection of Christmas Jumpers.</p>
<p>We also invited some guests to scrim against the Brawler Tenerife roster as a warm up which went very well. Our Brawlers' hard work is paying off.</p>
<p><b>Momo</b></p>
<p>We've been training with jumpers on during scrims to help with heat training and our scrims are generally quite intense, almost "iron man" if you like, so it's good for the endurance, especially since we're playing with 9.</p>
<p>We had a scrim with the "Tenerife 9" vs the rest of the Brawlers, some GCRD members, and some Bairn City members last weekend, a good mixed bunch to help us prepare. They were great, totally mixed it up and they didn't take it easy on us! It went well and gave us a few more things to work on.</p>
<p><i>How does preparation for an international game differ to preparing for a local game?</i></p>
<p><b>Pudz</b></p>
<p>We have to think about things like jet lag [not to Tenerife though! - Ed], lower roster numbers due to the distance travelled and, most importantly, the bar order; "Tres sidras por favor!"</p>
<p>As a team we are very excited to represent Scottish roller derby on an international scale, strengthening the roller derby community even further.</p>
<p><b>Momo</b></p>
<p>Preparing for Tenerife seems a lot more labour intensive from an organising point of view. If it wasn't for Nikki, Brawlers' Bench Manager, sorting the entire thing out I think we'd be walking from one end of the island to the other to get to the game. I did my bit as well though: I organised a rainbow of the best beach towels Scotland's ever seen! We're obviously doing our heat training and some of us have been working on our after party stamina to last the entire holiday, I guess maybe some of the guys have been working on their beach bods, not likely but maybe....</p>
<p>We've lost a few skaters at the start of this year/ tail end of last year but we've gained some new young blood with loads of potential and honestly the Brawlers are the strongest we've ever been.</p>
<p>We're looking forward to what we have planned for the rest of 2017 and can't wait to see what 2018 brings!</p>

<p>A huge 'thank you' to Pudz and Momo for taking the time to answer my questions!</p>
<p>I, for one, am so excited for the first GCB international game and wish the team loads of luck.</p>
<p>Also, there's still time to donate and nominate your favourite brawler for a cheeky leg wax! <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/waxonwaxbrawff">http://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/waxonwaxbrawff</a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is traditional, we’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"><span class="s2"><b>Flat Track Stats</b></span></a> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <strong><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). Our new SRD Rank for July is out (pending updates as late scores trickle into FTS), with the usual map mode, score predictions and the rest, for all teams in the world. (It also has some WFTDA rankings, including the 31 May ranking, as well as SRDRank. We will be adding the WFTDA July ranking as soon as it is released.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]</span></p>

<h3>Upcoming Events</h3>
Our upcoming events for this week are the competing Road to Barcelona Men's National Teams events, <strong>both</strong> on the <strong>18th/19th November</strong> in Europe!
<p>Team Germany Men's are hosting one of the events, with no announced teams (other than Germany).</p>
<p>Team Netherlands Men's are hosting the other event, with Ireland, Belgium, Scotland, Spain and Italy confirmed, as well as the hosts.</p>
<p>(This leaves the Nordic teams, England, Wales, and Central Europe for Germany to persuade over to their event.)</p>
<p>We're raising this here just so no-one is surprised by the two events fighting with each other!</p>

<p></p>
<p>There's an understandable level of anticipation surrounding the announcement of the next WFTDA Rankings, in a week or so's time, as they have the material effect of determining who makes it to WFTDA Playoffs. (Even if teams decline the invitation, then the ranking still determines who filters in from the bottom to replace them.)</p>
<p>Similar excitement, of course, surrounds the MRDA rankings, and all of the National rankings and placements which are slowly being announced as the various National seasons draw to a close (Finland's is determined this weekend, for example).</p>
<p>However, sometimes it is interesting to take a more Global view. Not all the best teams in the world are members of WFTDA or MRDA, and of course, few rating or ranking schemes attempt to transcend gender in comparing Men's to Women's to Junior derby (or even recognise the existence of Coed/OpenToAll derby at all!).</p>
<p>This lack is one reason why we developed the SRDRank rating and ranking system (the other reason being the lack of ratings or coverage for Latin America). While you all wait to see who gets to go to WFTDA Playoffs, we're going to indulge ourselves by working on that Global scale.</p>
<p>(Sadly, as SRDRank depends on records in <a href="http://www.flattrackstats.com"><strong>Flat Track Stats</strong></a>, some teams may be unfairly represented here, as they simply don't bother uploading data to FTS. We're actively working on this ourselves, but we really need the teams themselves to engage as well - especially, sadly, in those Latin American regions which are <em>also</em> unfairly lacking in coverage.)</p>
<p>All of the top X listings can be viewed (and interactively manipulated) via our <a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html"><strong>SRDRank</strong></a> main page (which also provides a map view, and score predictions, for both SRDRank and WFTDA), which is also prettier!</p>
<p>Let's start with the potentially most controversial result... the Global (All Gender) Rankings for 4 July 2017, Top 50. This covers both A and B teams, which matters only a little bit - most of the teams in the Top 50 are A teams. Blue is Men's teams, and Green is Women.</p>
<p>(We should note, and the main SRDRank clique analysis makes clear, that the relative rankings of Mens and Women's teams are the least certain thing here - perhaps more Men's teams should play Women's teams, and help to improve our data here ;) )

</tbody></table>
The striking thing for us is how international both rankings are - with the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe and Latin America all appearing in the listing somewhere. For the Women's ranking, it should be no surprise to see non-WFTDA member, Roller Derby Toulouse, sitting at #17, given their performance in the French Nationale.
Oly Rollers (who do still play WFTDA rules derby, but just don't turn up to WFTDA playoffs) might be more of a surprise at #26!
<p>Sadly, there's not enough Coed/OTA derby tracked by FTS to provide a Top 50 - and the OTA teams are also geographically siloed - teams in the UK only play UK teams, and so on. We suspect that this is partly also due to poor recording of actual coed/OTA derby when it happens - so you can help us fix that by letting us know when you play a bout, and what the result is!</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/07/06/world-roller-derby-rankings-top-40s-movers-shakers/2/"><strong>Page 2</strong></a>, we'll cover the big movers in the rankings in the last few months.
<!--nextpage-->
</p>
<h3>Movers and Shakers</h3>
Of course, static Top 50s are all very well (if you want to see them, they're back on <a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2017/07/06/world-roller-derby-rankings-top-40s-movers-shakers/1/"><strong>Page 1</strong></a>), but what's exciting is seeing how teams have moved around over the season.
So, lets look at the way in which teams have changed ranking from our first rating of the season - 31 Jan - to the most recent rating on 4 July...
There's several ways we could measure the degree to which a team has improved (or not) - we could look at the change in ranking position, or we could compare their change in rating in various ways.
<p>Comparing just change in ranking has the issue that teams in a closely-matched patch of the ranking (where lots of teams are close in ability) could move many more ranking spots with a small change in relative strength... whereas teams in a part of the ranking where the difference between teams is large (say, the top 50) have to improve much more to make the same jumps.
On the other hand, comparing rating changes has its own problem - as the ratings are generated each month based upon the teams eligible for that month, the absolute values of the ratings themselves can fluctuate a little. (We can fix this by comparing against normalised ratings, where adjust the values to have the same mean and variance from month to month... but that introduces its own biases.)</p>
<p>What we're going to do is select teams which have moved a large amount by more than one of these measures - these teams are absolutely the big movers, regardless of how you work it out. It's also important to ensure we have enough bouts on record to make a move statistically solid, so we're going to start with the big movers in the Top 200:
</p>
<h4>Top 200 Risers and Fallers</h4>
The biggest risers are:
<p><strong>162. Glasgow Men's Roller Derby</strong>
<strong>23. Roller Derby Toulouse (Quad Guards)</strong>
<strong>194. Team Rock'Est ()</strong>
<strong>46. Oklahoma Men's Roller Derby</strong>
<strong>42. Panam Squad </strong>[Paris]</p>
<p>where, yes, they're all men's teams with the biggest movement, as the smaller set of Mens leagues makes rating and ranking more volatile.
Glasgow Men's Roller Derby have had a very good first year, and it's a mix of how good their year has been, and also their newness as a team, which has resulted in them topping the movers here.
Toulouse have also had a great year - and they're the highest ranked Men's team to show significant movement here - just due to consistent good work in all of their bouts.</p>
<p>... with the first rising women's teams as:
</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>172 Crossroads City Derby Girls</strong> [New Mexico, USA]
</span><span class="s1"><strong>113 Treasure Valley Roller Derby Inc</strong> [Idaho, USA]</span><span class="s1">
</span><span class="s1"><strong>187 Beckley Area Derby Dames</strong> [West Virginia, USA]
</span><span class="s1"><strong>144 Tampere Roller Derby</strong> [Finland]
</span><span class="s1"><strong>11 Denver Roller Derby</strong> [Colorado, USA]</span></p>
Crossroads may surprise here, as their WFTDA rating has not changed that positively - however, they played a lot of B-teams, not eligible for WFTDA Sanctioning, and we (and FTS) rate them highly on their performance there. Treasure Valley mostly benefit from having almost nothing on record for 2016 - something they might want to address in FTS - and a solid 2017. BADD have just had a very solid few years since joining WFTDA in 2016 - they've fairly consistently improved in every game, a testament to good coaching and good learning.
Tampere, our sole Euro Women's team in the risers, have had a very good start to 2017, although a slight weakness in their last few bouts (against Gent and Lille) is starting to show, just as they enter the Suomi Cup finals.
Finally, Denver are the big news here - and our friends at The Derby Apex have included them in <a href="https://thederbyapex.com/the-9-true-climbers-of-the-2017-wftda-regular-season-136951917bbd"><strong>their risers</strong></a> for WFTDA rankings as well. (We don't have some of their other risers and fallers here, because FTS and SRDRank ratings adapted much faster to the European teams ratings way back in 2016.)
<p>The biggest fallers are also dominated by movement in the Men's part of the charts, with the list as (biggest fall at top):
</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">77 Chinook City Roller Derby (Men's) </span></strong><span class="s1">[Calgary, Canada]</span><strong><span class="s1">
</span><span class="s1">161 Brisbane City-Rollers (Men's)
</span><span class="s1">20 New York Shock Exchange
</span><span class="s1">197 Chain Gang (Arizona B)
</span><span class="s1">106 Dow Jones Average (NYSE B)
</span><span class="s1">45 Victoria Mens Roller Derby
</span><span class="s1">93 Sydney City SMASH Men's Derby </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">
</span>15 London Rollergirls </strong>
<strong><span class="s1">130 Orangeville Roller Girls </span></strong><span class="s1">[Ontario, Canada]</span></p>
Chinook City (Glenmore Reservoir Dogs) have just had a somewhat less exciting 2017 than their 2016 - much of their drop is due to their performance at The Big O, coupled with the fall in NYSE's rating, which of course affects the teams they played as well.
<p>All the drops in Australian Men's Derby are complex, and mainly due to the sparse nature of Men's Derby ratings in general. The last MRDA Down Under pulled a few ratings down due to the cumulative effect of Argentina's ThunderQuads visiting, and doing a bit better than expected against Australia as a whole...</p>
<p>The shock here is perhaps that London Rollergirls have dropped off significantly, mostly due to a very uncertain start to the season - they've underperformed against essentially every European team they've played so far in 2017, with only pretty solid performances more recently across in the USA arresting their fall in ranking more. (It's not clear if this is more to do with all of Europe catching up with London, and pulling them down in compensation, or if London really are suffering from some of their recent roster changes this much.)</p>
<p>Finally, Orangeville were in the unfortunate state of having a really good... end to 2016 (a great game against Muddy River) which pushed up their rating entering the new season. Unfortunately, (relatively) poor performances against Montreal and Boston at the start of 2017 pulled them back down again to where they'd been for most of 2016...
</p>
<h4>Overall Risers and Fallers</h4>
<p class="p1"> If we extend our view outside the top 200, we get a lot more big movers in both directions, although we're also sacrificing some reliability here - the lower rated teams also have less good records in FTS, so their ratings are more volatile in general.</p>
Our biggest gainers for 2017, then, are all UK Men's teams, one of whom will be familiar:
<p><strong>242. Beta Test Brummies (Crash Test Brummies B) </strong>[Birmingham]<strong>
162. Glasgow Men's Roller Derby
</strong>and<strong>
372. Granite City Brawlers </strong>[Aberdeen]
all climbing more than <em>800 spots</em>, and more than <em> 2 rating units</em> (a factor of 8 strength increase) over the course of the year to date. Of course, these teams have also not played too many games in the last 6 months [GMRD have played the most, and have the most solid record here, whilst the Brawlers are mostly trading off of a single, impressive, victory over the Knights of Oldham ], so we'll need to wait and see if their ratings stabilise at their new values.</p>
<p>Slightly less impressive on ranking, but almost as strong on rating, the remaining crop of really big movers, all shifting by more than <em>1.5 rating</em> points, and on average 500 ranking spots:
<strong>798 Shee Devils (Sitka Sound Slayers B)</strong> [Alaska, USA]
<strong>461 Mandrágoras Roller Derby</strong> [Patagonia, Argentina]
<strong>1072 Lindsay Roller Derby</strong> [Ontario, Canada]
<strong>1644 Silver Bridge Bruisers</strong> [Ohio/West Virginia, USA]</p>
<p>As with the biggest movers, some of these are shifting on the basis of a single result (the Shee Devils victory over Rage City B), whilst others are more solid (Mandrágoras moving on the basis of an impressive performance at Torneo Sucio, Lindsay recovering from a poor end to 2016 with consistent performances in 2017, and the relatively new Silver Bridge just improving with experience).</p>
<p>On the other end of things, most of the big falls happened for teams who were already fairly far down the table... which also makes their ranking more stable in general. As a result, we're only listing 4 fallers, all of whom dropped significantly in ranking and rating this season:
<strong>1530 Oxford Roller Derby B</strong> [Oxford, UK]
<strong>774 Air Raid Roller Girls</strong> [Oregon, USA]
<strong>1630 Insurrexion Roller Derby (a member of No Excuses Roller Derby)</strong> [Argentina]
<strong>1492 Borderland Brawlers Roller Derby (Coed)</strong> [Peterbourgh/Rutland, UK]</p>
<p>Of these, Insurrexion and Borderland Brawlers have dropped on the basis of a single significant bout this year, which was nevertheless sufficient to pull them down. If the two teams in question have more bouts to add to FTS, who knows what it would do to their actual rating? Oxford B seem to have had a much harder time of it consistently, although given that they only have a single bout on record in 2016, it's possible that they were just overranked previously...</p>
<p>We hope this look at a world beyond just WFTDA ratings has distracted you from those WFTDA Rankings themselves!

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is traditional, we’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"><span class="s2"><b>Flat Track Stats</b></span></a> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <strong><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts). Our new SRD Rank for July will be out this week – the fifth for this year, with this years’ redesigned interface, allowing you to browse historical rankings for the last 10 years, view a map of all the active teams, select by any combinations of country, gender, and get predictions of scores. (It also has some WFTDA rankings, including the 31 May ranking, as well as SRDRank.)</span></p>
