<p><html><body><div>Okay, so the monthly diaries running a little late is turning out to be a theme. Entirely not to blame (and, in fact, responsible for leaping in at the last moment) is FVRG's diarist for this entry, Maz-Manian Devil!</div></p>

<div><strong>What first attracted you to Roller Derby?</strong>

</div>
<p>I never knew it existed until it was on the front of the local paper! I have always been into extreme sports, so this was right up my street, its the best thing i've ever done!</p>
<div>

<strong>Who are your derby heroes?</strong>

</div>
<p>I don't really have any heroes as I've only been doing this since October. I'd have to say for all the people that put on a set of skates, who have the determination. Also to the ones that have had bad injuries and get back on track. It takes alot!  I'm sure along the way alot of people will inspire me!!</p>
<div>
<strong>Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when you're starting out. How did you choose your name, and how does it reflect your personality on track?</strong>

</div>
<p>Well, this is embarrassing... I was getting ready for training one night and thought I really need a derby name. I looked down to see I was wearing Taz-Manain Devil pants... yup, the rest is history!   I'd like to think that Maz-Manian Devil reflects me on track; I like to think I cause whirlwinds.</p>
<div>
<strong>What was your biggest initial difficulty?</strong>

</div>
<p>I was so used to my roller blades, so going from them to quads was a big deal. I had to learn a new motion, using toe-stops and how to fall correctly. I'm a very determined person, so I wasn't going to let anything stop me!</p>
<div>
<strong>Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word?</strong>

</div>
<p>Yeah, its hard not to talk about it!  Usually people ask me "how did you get that bruise?" Well, it was Roller Derby!.... :D  They always ask: do you not get hurt?
I laugh, "yeah...its so much fun, especially when you get hit so hard you fly throught the air!...you should come join us! "   Maybe i'm selling it wrong?!?</p>
<div><strong>What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/ done this month?</strong>

</div>
<p>We're just back from Belfast where I played my 1st ever bout, which was an amazing experience.....although it was very tough.  It's made me realise that I have a long way to go and that I have so much more to learn! I'm really looking forward to it all :)</p>
<div>
<strong>What were the most difficult and the best things?</strong>

</div>
<p>The most difficult thing for me was learning all the rules so that I could get on the team and go to Belfast. I had alot of support from my teammate Dita, who pushed me to succeed. This is the amazing thing about FVRG, every single person brings something that makes you want to push yourself even further.</p>

<strong>What's new for the Fierce Valley this month?</strong>

</div>
<p>We have a bout against Wolverhampton towards the end of the year, so its hard intense training for FVRG!</body></html></p>
