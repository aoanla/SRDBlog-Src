<p><html><body><p>European Roller Derby is a rising force, and it's as important to be a part of it as it is to get membership of WFTDA, in my opinion. The big European Derby meetup is the yearly <a href="http://bearcityrollerderby.com/e-r-o-c-2012/">European Rollerderby Organlsational Conference</a>, which is hosted by Bear City Roller Derby in Berlin this year. The schedule will be split over the 27-29th Janurary, 2012.</p>
<p>There are separate registration for skaters and referees, and there will be masterclasses and other events for both officials and players.</p>
<p>This is an ideal chance for Scottish leagues to keep up with the European Derby scene, and it is perhaps especially useful for new leagues.</p>
<p>Plus, you get to see Berlin!</p>
<p>Registration closes on the 20th of November, so get in quick while you still can!</p></body></html></p>
