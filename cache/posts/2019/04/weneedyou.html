<p>Roller Derby is a worldwide sport, and there's far too much to cover just with our internal posts.</p>
<p>This is a reminder, then, that the Scottish Roller Derby Blog is happy to host guest posts from anywhere in the world of Roller Derby.
(We'd prefer English-language, but we would also consider content in other languages, especially if this raises awareness of a particular community.)</p>
<p>We already host a regular Guest column with Speedy Convalesce... but we'd like to see more people writing, especially from places which need more attention: Latin America, Asia, New Zealand, and Africa.
(If you're not on one of those regions, that doesn't mean we're not interested, but those regions are particularly in need of representation).</p>
<p>We'd also value more input from the Scottish community where we're hosted.</p>
<p>With the new format and hosting of SRD, there are lots of ways to get guest posts to us:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can link us to a Google Doc with your article in it.</li>
<li>You can send us a link to a PDF or a Word document with your article (we'd prefer PDF).</li>
<li>You can send us a document in Restructured Text or Markdown format, with attached images.</li>
</ul>
<p>or you can contact us directly by email, or social media, to discuss your idea for an article, and work with us on how best to produce it. (Our <a class="reference external" href="mailto:scottishrollerderby&#64;gmail.com">email address</a> is at the bottom of every page of the blog, and we're available on
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/scottish.rollerderby/">Facebook</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/scottishrollerderby/">Instagram</a> and WeChat (id: sskipsey) )</p>
