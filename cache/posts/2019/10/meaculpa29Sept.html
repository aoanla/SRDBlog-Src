<p>Whilst we try to catch all the highlights for a weekend, sometimes some escape us. Facebook's event search tools are not good at finding events unless they're physically close to you; and they've disabled or limited most of the ways of reading lots of data from their site. Instagram doesn't provide any way to search for events at all; and not enough leagues have websites with rss feeds or calendars that we can pull from to make this reliable. (And, whilst <em>most</em> games get listed on Flat Track Stats, not all do; and not all events are bouts, or bouts which are suitable for ranking!)</p>
<p>We'd like to encourage leagues, again, to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:scottishrollerderby&#64;gmail.com">email us</a>, or Facebook message us, or Instagram message us (or join our Discord server and talk to us there) to let us know about your events; or tell us how to (automatically) track your calendars if you have them!</p>
<p id="whatsapp"><span id="discord"></span>We'd like to return to a few events we missed last weekend, though, just to restore the balance.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Firstly, in Uppsala, first fixtures of the Division 2 Suomi Cup series for 2019/20 saw the hosts ( <a class="reference external" href="http://www.uppsalarollerderby.se/">Jackdaw City Rollers</a> ) compete in a round robin with Örebro's Nerike Knockouts and Sundsvall's Demolition Rollers, over 2 days.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/111774/overview">[FTS EVENT]</a></p>
<p>The entire event was streamed on the Sweden-based Solidsport platform, and at the time of writing, &quot;replays&quot; [saved copies of the stream] are available at: <a class="reference external" href="https://solidsport.com/uppsala-roller-derby/replays">https://solidsport.com/uppsala-roller-derby/replays</a> although registration is required to view them.</p>

<p>The next Division 2 fixture is in the December, and sees Uppsala face Helsingborg's Helltown, the final member of the series; before the division completes in the new year for the final games.</p>

<p>Over in Brazil, Capivaras Roller Derby (of Piracicaba) hosted a double header event with guests Gray City Rebels of São Paulo on Sunday. This has</p>

<p>As far as we know, this was a multi-game event, with contact, and low-contact scrimmages.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Finally, a significant event which deserves more coverage, although being wholly-North-American, it's outside of our self-imposed limit on highlights...</p>
<p>Hawai'i saw their annual Battle of the Islands event last weekend. This year, the event was hosted by Pacific Roller Derby (O'ahu), with teams competing from Maui Roller Girls, Garden Isle Renegade Rollers (Kaua'i), and the &quot;Big Island Mashup Team&quot; (representing Echo City Knockouts and Waimea W ), as well as the hosts themselves.</p>

<p>As well as the main tournament, run as a 4 team round robin, the event also featured a Junior Roller derby exhibition bout by the Honolulu LeiOuts, and a closing Black v White scrimmage. The Friday before the tournament additionally saw an Officiating Clinic, for all visiting officials (referees and NSOs), run by the very well travelled Mass The Ref.</p>
<p>The entire tournament was also livestreamed on YouTube, and we link to the video in each game in the table (none of these videos are full-length, as far as we can tell).
Scores were:</p>
