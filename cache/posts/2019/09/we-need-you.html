<p>We have another article tantalisingly close to publication, but whilst we wait for the final sign-offs, we'd like to take the time to remind everyone that we're open to article pitches from any person in roller derby, anywhere in the world, in any language (or languages).
If you have something you want to say about Roller Derby, then we're happy to work with you to say it - as we have, for example, with Vendaval Roller Derby just this week. Vendaval contacted us to work on this article, and we thought that it was important enough to share.</p>
<p>In the next few weeks, we're hoping to have a few more guest articles - written entirely by others - as well some features and catchups on more exciting events across the world, returning to some of the national tournaments we covered last year, and some new events for this year.</p>
<p>But we're always open for more articles: we'd like to help amplify the voices of the entire roller derby community, regardless of the language they speak, the country they're in, or the divisions they play in. So, please, get in touch with us, by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/scottish.rollerderby/">Facebook</a>, <a class="reference external" href="mailto:scottishrollerderby&#64;gmail.com">email</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/scottishrollerderby/">Instagram</a> message; or even WeChat (we can't link to WeChat directly) or WhatsApp. (We're thinking about a VK account, but don't have one yet.)</p>
