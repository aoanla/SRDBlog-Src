<p>Hi everybody!
I'm Sugar Molotov from Banshees - Roller Derby Udine. We are a very small team in the rearmost region in north-east Italy and we are struggling to form a complete roster as many of us did or are still doing right now all around the world. We have all experienced the &quot;roller what...?&quot; reaction from people, and one day I thought: why is it so difficult to explain what's so exciting in this sport? How can I let them see and feel what I saw in Roller Derby and I'm feeling to this day?</p>
<p>So we decided to create a personal space on our social accounts (Facebook and Instagram) for every skater to tell what they love about Derby and why they choose every day to play this amazing, thrilling and yet expensive and possibly dangerous sport. We are all kind of very different people and still this brings us together in an unprecedented way, at least in my experience. This is how the <strong>#whyIchooserollerderby</strong> campaign was born - of course we do not have as many followers as other, bigger teams would have, but we wanted to try it anyway!</p>
<p>Also, space is a very important concept in Roller Derby so we put no limit: I asked my teammates to join this project, choosing a photo and writing whatever they wanted about it. I wanted them to feel at ease to share what they felt comfortable to. On the way I thought that it would be nice to have other skaters joining it as well, and here I am asking if you'd fell like join us. We don't have much to offer in return, except that we'll treasure every single contribution as if it was our own. Every text is translated in three languages, Italian as it's our nationality, English because we want as many people as possible to read it and Friulano which is the language spoken in this specific, small region of Italy and  we want to take part in the effort to preserve it. It's part of our identity as well. Also, one of our teammate translated hers in Spanish since it's her legacy, and we loved that immensely.
So! I hope I've given you a reason to join our small project in the hope to make it count in spreading the news there's a new world here, and it's like nothing else.
Here are our pages address, the campaign has just started of course, but you can see how it looks:
