<strong>All we ask is that you are over 18, have a bit of gumption, a splash of spirit, a dose of commitment and a sense of humour.</strong></p>
<p>We have skates and protective equipment all waiting for you to try on before the Derby Bug bites you and you rush off to buy yourself some pretty new gear :)</p>
<p>Joining GCRG is a brilliant way to get fit and meet new people!</p>
<p>Yes this is a women's sport but GCRG are on the look out for referees, so any guys who would like to get involved in the sport should pop along too!</p>
<p>See You on the Track!!</p>
<p>GCRG xx
