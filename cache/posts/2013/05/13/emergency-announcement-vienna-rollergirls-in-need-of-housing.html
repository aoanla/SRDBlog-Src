<p><html><body><p>The brilliant Vienna Rollergirls are coming over to play Auld Reekie Roller Girls this coming weekend... but they've hit on a problem.</p>
<p>A last-minute cancellation by one of their hosts means that as many of 6 of their skaters have nowhere to stay in Edinburgh for the entire period they're visiting.</p>
<p>We know that the derby community is full of helpful and supportive people so:</p>
<p><del>If anyone can put up any number (up to 6) Viennese roller girls from 16th to 21st May, then you will have their eternal gratitude. (Edinburgh much preferred, but I suspect that in reasonable distance would work if needed.)</del></p>
<p><del>Contact: Sabine HansaBlast Anderson or Anke Schaffartzik via Facebook if you can help.</del></p>
<p>Situation resolved: thanks to You Sayin Bolt of Bairn City Rollers, housing has been found for all of the potentially homeless skaters for Vienna. Thanks to everyone who offered a place for them!</p>
