<p>Scottish Men's National Roller Derby Team, Power of Scotland, are off to Calgary next year to compete in the second Men's Roller Derby World Cup.</p>
<p>(They're also off to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/4NRDC/">4Nations</a> tournament this weekend, to play against France, Wales and England, which we'll have some reporting about after the event.)</p>
<p>In support of their expenses in travelling across the Atlantic to represent their country, Power of Scotland have planned a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/432571486927246/">packed fundraising event</a> for the <strong>13th</strong> of <strong>December </strong>on the theme of "Beards, Brains and Brainpower".</p>
<p>The "beards" component will be represented by the result of the <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/posbestbeard">Sponsored Beard Shave</a> contest. Three Power of Scotland more hirsute skaters - Bairn City's rEd Baron, Wirral's 12 Gauge and Mean City's Optimus Grime - have been competing to collect sponsorship funds. At this fundraiser, the skater with the least funds raised will be professionally shorn of their carefully tended facial hair.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the "brains" component is provided by a Team Quiz Night, featuring multiple rounds and multiple prizes. Teams are limited to 5 people. The quizmaster, Alan Muir, has been working hard on fiendish practical puzzlers, so we anticipate a challenging event.</p>
<p>Of course, the "beers" element is provided by the host venue, <strong>The Raven</strong>, at <strong>81-85 Renfield Street, Glasgow</strong>.</p>
<p>The night of fundraising will start at <strong>18:45.</strong></body></html></p>
