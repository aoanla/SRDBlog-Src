<p>Granite City Roller Girls and Granite City Brawlermen are recruiting!</p>
<p>Saturday 6th September is an exciting day for Roller Derby Recruitment in Aberdeen with not one but two intakes!</p>
<p>First up, Granite City Roller Girls are holding their intake day at Aberdeen Lads Club (Dill Road) from 11:00-13:00. Then from 13.30 to 15.30 the Brawlermen will be welcoming new recruits as well!</p>
<p>Both GCRG and GCB have experienced coaches who can teach people of all levels so no skating experience is necessary and we can provide equipment - please drop us a message on Facebook to let us know what shoe size you take so we can make sure we have skates for you on the day!</p>
<p>GCRG are also on the lookout for referees so any ladies or gents who would like to get involved with this aspect of the sport should pop along too!</p>
<p>Roller Derby is a brilliant way to get fit and meet new people! All we ask is that youâ€™re over 18 years old, wear non restrictive clothing and bring plenty of water.</p>
<p>Put on some skates, be your own hero!</p>
