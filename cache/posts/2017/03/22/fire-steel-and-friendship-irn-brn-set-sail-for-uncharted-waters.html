<p><html><body><p>The West of Scotland is renowned for forging some of the most iconic vessels and cultural objects in the world - from the QE2 to red phone boxes.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise then that UK roller derby's newest team should have its roots in the industrial heart of Scotland - where history was literally forged from fire and steel - or that they call themselves the Irn Brn.</p>
<p>Glasgow Men's Roller Derby (GMRD) have already gone on a remarkable journey since they first sparked into life last summer.</p>

<p>Anyone involved in roller derby will know that the tectonic plates beneath our sport are always moving - teams rise, teams fall, legacies are secured, old legends fade.</p>
<p>Some skaters drift away from the sport for good - others depart teams to form new alliances as they seek different horizons and chase different goals.</p>
<p>That was the case with the founding fathers - and mothers - of GMRD.</p>
<p>At the centre of the league is an ethos - like the nucleus at the heart of an atom - attracting skaters to it like toe-stop-hopping protons:</p>
<p><strong>Skate, create, innovate - work hard together with friends to take on the world.</strong></p>
<p>GMRD pride themselves on being more than the sum of their talented parts (the roster includes a range of international-standard skaters - including seven members of the Power of Scotland training squad).</p>
<p>More than a league, more than a team - this is a family.</p>
<p>The Irn Brn set sail next month for uncharted territory for a Scottish men's team - the 2017 British Roller Derby Championships.</p>
<p>GMRD will play in Men's Tier 3 North - alongside the Bairn City Skelpies (also breaking new ground for Scottish dudes), Teesside Skate Invaders and Men Behaving Derby.</p>
<p>First up on April 16 is a trip to the Emerald Isle, where GMRD take on the Skate Invaders.</p>
<p>GMRD Managing Director Hugs and Kisses (aka JR) said: "We can't wait to get on track at the British Champs - it's going to be an adventure for everyone associated with GMRD.</p>
<p>"Teesside will be tough opponents and we are preparing for a very competitive game against a talented team of top skaters.</p>
<p>"However, we know we have a strong team and have been training hard. It's going to be a great opening day of derby for Tier 3 North."</p>
<p>Many of GMRD have played Teesside before as members of other teams, but there have been line-up changes since then and the standard of derby is forever climbing skywards, so it will be an intriguing match-up.</p>
<p>GMRD will be buoyed by a good run of form which saw them beat Crash Test Brummies B (Beta Test Brummies) 199-135 and Barrow Infernos 226-159.</p>
<p>After the double-header in Dublin, the action will move to Grangemouth on May 13, when GMRD take on the Skelpies at Grangemouth.</p>
<p>The third double-header will be hosted by GMRD at the ARC Sportscentre in Glasgow on June 10, with GMRD completing their fixtures with a game against Men Behaving Derby.</p>
<p>The top two teams in Tier 3 North will then play the two teams in Tier 3 South, with the victors of each game promoted to Tier 2.</p>
<p>Hugs added: "We're under no illusions - this is going to be a tough series of games, but we really can't wait. This is what we've been working hard towards since we formed the league last year.</p>
<p>"Teamwork will be key. We have some very skilled individuals within the team, but our goal is to be a cohesive unit firing on all cylinders - forged in the heat of intense training sessions, scrims and games."</p>
