<p><html><body><p>A lot of exciting things happen in Roller Derby without getting the attention they deserve.</p>
<p>One of these has been the <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Torneo-Brutal-709201495857174/">Torneo Brutal</a></strong>, a unique short-format-derby tournament which has been held by the Chilean leagues for the last few years.</p>
<p>We talked to organiser Lola Paranoia about the genesis of the tournament, and the currently completed Third Edition of it.</p>
<p>"In August 2015 was the first edition of the Torneo Brutal. The idea was copied from a similar tournament in Argentina, where a friend participated and told us the experience. At that time, we had little competition in the country, few leagues, so the format of the tournament seemed perfect."</p>
<p>Looking for a host, Vina del Mar's men's league - Tacones Bandidos - were most excited and agreed to be hosts for the first ever Torneo Brutal , and the two sequels so far!</p>
<p>Along the way, Lola's artist friend Picota, and Rambla and Mr. Sokram, joined the project as organisers.</p>
<p>The format is similar to the European "Derby Sevens", with 6-skater teams (plus a bench) playing 30 minute games, otherwise according to WFTDA/MRDA Rules. Like many Sevens tournaments, the teams are CoEd/Open-To-All (or "Roller Derby mixto"), which is also a more popular approach in Latin America in general, and are essentially "exhibition teams" created for each edition.</p>
<p>The third edition of the Tournament sees 11 teams compete in a single-elimination bracket, which is easily managed with the smaller format games.</p>
<p>The Teams - Zicod'lia, La Mafia Del Sur, Virutas, Mujeros, Emoticon Team, Cosmopolitan, Team Sexy, Cousins Power, Chalabota, Malbec Madness, and Jurassic Quad - draw skaters from across Chile, as well as across the border from Mendoza, Argentina.</p>
<p>An intense tournament resulted in a win for Emoticon Team over Viruta, with a narrow 119-94 scoreline, with Viruta finishing the 30 minutes with only 2 players on track. (The reduced starting roster means that Torneo Brutal does not have a minimum-roster to continue competing after injury or foul-outs.) The exciting footage is available here, via Facebook Live: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/709201495857174/videos/1126079294169390/">https://www.facebook.com/709201495857174/videos/1126079294169390/</a></p>
<p>With this edition of the tournament complete, the intent is definitely there for a 4th edition - possibly incorporating elements from other short-format roller derby around the world. We'll keep you informed about details as they emerge!</p>
