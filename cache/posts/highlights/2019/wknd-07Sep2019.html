<p>This is a pretty busy weekend, so we're just doing whole-weekend and Saturday fixtures in this update, with Sunday's selection in a follow-up article.
The coming few days, as well as seeing the first of the WFTDA Playoffs (with attendees from) also see the first in a regular series of Short Track events in the UK, a a gaggle of bootcamps and clinics from the UK to Argentina, and even more tournaments. In National tournaments, Chile hosts the 2nd and 3rd fixtures in its Torneo X, in Vi</p>
<p>The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an &quot;extra&quot; event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the <em>Scottish</em> Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as &quot;special&quot; enough, at our discretion ;) )</p>
<p>We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.</p>
<p>In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).</p>
<p>Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.greensbororollerderby.com">Greensboro Roller Derby</a> host the first <a class="reference external" href="https://wftda.com/events/tournament-central/2019-playoffs-winston-salem/">WFTDA Playoffs</a> of this season, of interest to us due to the participation of (deep breath): <em>2x4 Roller Derby</em> (Argentina); <em>Helsinki Roller Derby</em> (Finland); <em>Paris Rollergirls</em> and <em>Lomme Roller Girls</em> (France); <em>Bear City Roller Derby</em> (Germany); and <em>Rainy City Roller Derby</em> (UK). That's fully half the tournament represented by non-USA teams, which is extremely good for international roller derby.</p>
<p>There will also be a Lady Trample-run Chicks in Bowls 'Shred session' on the following Monday, and the usual WFTDA contact options during Playoffs.</p>
<p><em>Note: at the time of writing, Hurricane Dorian is predicted to pass across, or close to, parts of North Carolina on Friday, with Winston-Salem at the western edge of the prediction envelope. At present, it is too early to say if evacuation will be ordered, due to the inherent uncertainty in hurricane modelling.</em></p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Paris Rollergirls versus Santa Cruz Derby Girls</li>
<li>Helsinki Roller Derby versus Lomme Roller Girls</li>
