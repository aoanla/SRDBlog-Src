# WARNING: Some themes, including the default Bootstrap 4 theme,

#          (in Bootstrap, the navbar can grow too large and cover contents.)
# WARNING: If you link to directories, make sure to follow

# POSTS and PAGES contains (wildcard, destination, template) tuples.
# (translatable)
#
# The wildcard is used to generate a list of source files
# (whatever/thing.rst, for example).
#
# That fragment could have an associated metadata file (whatever/thing.meta),
# and optionally translated files (example for Spanish, with code "es"):
#     whatever/thing.es.rst and whatever/thing.es.meta
#
#     This assumes you use the default TRANSLATIONS_PATTERN.
#
# From those files, a set of HTML fragment files will be generated:
# cache/whatever/thing.html (and maybe cache/whatever/thing.html.es)
#
# These files are combined with the template to produce rendered
# pages, which will be placed at
# output/TRANSLATIONS[lang]/destination/pagename.html
#
# where "pagename" is the "slug" specified in the metadata file.
# The page might also be placed in /destination/pagename/index.html
# if PRETTY_URLS are enabled.
#
# The difference between POSTS and PAGES is that POSTS are added
# to feeds, indexes, tag lists and archives and are considered part
# of a blog, while PAGES are just independent HTML pages.
#
# Finally, note that destination can be translated, i.e. you can
# specify a different translation folder per language. Example:
