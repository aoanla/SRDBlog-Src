<html><body><strong>The Blog</strong>

The Scottish Roller Derby blog was started back in the summer of 2011, and since then, has covered the sport across Scotland, the UK, and beyond. As well as a focus on promoting Scottish Roller Derby, with both the local teams and the two National Squads, we also like to promote the spread of Roller Derby worldwide; we do international interviews, support services (like multi-timezone tournament guides), statistical analysis and more.

<em>aoanla</em>

aoanla is a physicist/systems support guy for the UK bit of the LHC experiment at CERN in real life, and therefore already had some experience in looking at high-speed collisions before getting into roller derby. He writes bout reports for the bouts he turns up to on his own <a href="http://aoanla.blogspot.com/">blog</a> [since inactive after moving here], and has also developed quite a lot of the statistical work that we write about. He's a contributor to the Flat Track Stats bout archive moderation effort, as well as to various other rating and organisation efforts.

<em>Camelon Diaz</em>

I’m Mhairi, or Camelon Diaz, and I’ve been skating with Fierce Valley Roller Girls since August 2011. I got involved after finally bowing to peer pressure from a couple of friends, and I’m so glad I did. In real life, I’m a librarian, spending most of my days surrounded by piles of books, so it’s really quite liberating to lace up my skates and hit the track!

I’m part of the Youth Development committee of FVRG, trying to get our junior league, Fierce Valley Roller Cubs, up and running. I was keen to be involved with this as I have a Cubs-age niece and I’d love for her to get as much out of derby as I do. I blog on the progress of the Cubs <a href="http://fiercevalleyrollercubs.blogspot.co.uk/">here</a> and will be contributing to SRD on the topic of junior derby.

There isn’t much I don’t like about derby but the things that especially appeal to me are the sense of community and the feeling of belonging, and of course all of the fantastic, supportive teammates we meet. If we can bring that to our junior league, I’ll be a happy skater!

<strong>The Author Team</strong>

Every bouting league in the country is represented on the Scottish Roller Derby blog by a skater, nso, or referee, and our author team also represent the worlds of Women's, Men's, All-Gender/Open To All, and Junior Roller Derby. Between them, they have decades of skating and organisational experience.</body></html>
