  :alt: The SRDB Award Logo: the Scottish Roller Derby Blog Logo (concentric circles, outer circle containing words "Scottish Roller Derby" all-capitals, separated by five-pointed stars, and an inner ring of stars just outside the boundary of the inner circle; inner circle containing a modification of the "lion of scotland", a heraldic lion, facing right, rampant, with a jammer cover on its head), but with a gold/bronze colour scheme applied.


This is the nominations list for the first ever SRDB Awards, in the category of Non-Regulation Tournament. This category covers the very many tournaments which do not use WFTDA Regulation play - Roller Derby Sevens, Sur5al, Short Track, and other rules variants.

The ground-rules for the Awards are covered in the launch post `here`_ .

As mentioned in that link, voting is by *approval voting*.
This means that you can, and should, tick boxes for all of the nominees you think would deserve to win. You can tick all the boxes, if you think they're all deserving; you can tick no boxes if you think none are deserving.

Everyone gets *a single submission* (with as many boxes ticked as they want); we have enabled detection of multiple submissions on this form, and will also be taking action against unusual voting patterns which get past this.

"A well needed mini tournament in Scotland that raises money for fantastic causes. Fun, free flowing, charming and enjoyable. All the things derby SHOULD be.

Shame they named it after a cheeky wee s\*\*\*e but never mind. [] A great representation of the spirit of Scottish roller derby with celebration of life and overcoming adversity at its core.
A wonderful tournament. [] It crosses all the derby divides and raises loads of cash to help fuck up cancer
