As mentioned in that link, voting is by *approval voting*.
This means that you can, and should, tick boxes for all of the nominees you think would deserve to win. You can tick all the boxes, if you think they're all deserving; you can tick no boxes if you think none are deserving.

Everyone gets *a single submission* (with as many boxes ticked as they want); we have enabled detection of multiple submissions on this form, and will also be taking action against unusual voting patterns which get past this.


Nominees for VOLUNTEER
----------------------

*Note: There were attempts to nominate the editor of this blog for this category. Whilst we appreciate the sentiment, we cannot be eligible for a nomination on grounds of fairness and impartiality.*

Nominee: Audrey (ex Dundee Roller Derby, sort-of-retired)
=============================================================

"If Audrey is around with Shuggs she will always end up doing something - jumps in to cover some NSO role, repair the track, even announce for 3 games straight!"

Nominee: Sticks and Stoner (British Champs)
=============================================

"Sticks has been a massive asset to British Champs this year, organising so much behind the scenes, while also being a top NSO"

Nominee: Taco Cat
===========================

"[for] Spanish language translation and content for wftda.tv and other things. We don't see a lot of this in derby. The Argentina teams making it so far is special, so to have someone trying to make more Spanish language things is really important. I see Taco Cat pop up all over speaking to skaters and doing interviews. "
