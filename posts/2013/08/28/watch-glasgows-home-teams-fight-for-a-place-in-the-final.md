The second bout sees the ever-smiling Bad Omens up against the formidable Death Stars.  The Bad Omens have so far lost both bouts played, with the Death Stars winning both of theirs.  As is the case with roller derby though, anything can happen – and both of these teams will fight with equal fire for a space in the final!
