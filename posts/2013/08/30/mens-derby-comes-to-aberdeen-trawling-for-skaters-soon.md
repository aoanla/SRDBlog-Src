<html><body><p>After some murmurs over the past few weeks on the gossip vine, Aberdeen has become the latest city in Scotland to have both Men's and Women's Roller Derby, with the launch of the all male Granite City Brawlermen last night via Facebook.
As yet they have no logo, but I am sure an appropriately manly and fishing-related artpiece can be only days away...

Getting things off to a flying start, the Brawlermen will be hosting a "Learn about Derby" session at The Garage, 17 Windmill Brae, on the 11th of October. This is intended for people new to derby who want to find out what it's all about, and will apparently feature some bout footage from previous mens derby bouts.

Then, to collect all their new recruits, the first fresh meat session will be on the 9th of November, appropriately at Aberdeen Lads Club in Tillydrone.
