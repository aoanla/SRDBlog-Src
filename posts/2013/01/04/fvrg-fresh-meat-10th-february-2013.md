<html><body><p>After an extremely busy 2012, <a title="FVRG on Facebook" href="www.facebook.com/FierceValleyRG" target="_blank">Fierce Valley Roller Girls</a> are kicking off the New Year with a Fresh Meat intake!

Their taster session will take place on the afternoon of Sunday 10th February in Falkirk*. You will be buddied up with an experienced skater to go through the basics of skating (and stopping!) safely. You will also borrow their safety equipment and skates in this session – but please buy your own mouth guard (you can pick these up for under £5 from Sports Direct). There will be a couple of weeks rest after the taster, and then from Sunday 24th February you will start your dedicated 12-week training programme.

If you are interested in joining FVRG and are over 18 years old, please complete their <a title="FVRG Registration Form" href="http://www.fvrg.co.uk/fresh-meat.php" target="_blank">Online Registration Form</a> to reserve your place in this Fresh Meat intake.

*Times and venue for the taster session will be confirmed once you have registered online
