There will be a wide-selection of handmade local crafts for sale - perfect for last-minute Christmas gifts! Confirmed stalls will include sweets in hand-painted jars from <a title="All the Noms Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/sweetNOMS?directed_target_id=651740771533574" target="_blank">All the Noms</a>; quirky accessories from <a title="Hummahazey Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/Hummahazey" target="_blank">Hummahazey</a>; handmade jewellery from <a title="Kurious Trinkets Facbeook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/KuriousTrinkets" target="_blank">Kurious Trinkets</a>; as well as a range of greetings cards and knitwear.

All this shopping will be hard work, so home-baking, teas, coffees, and a pot of soup kindly donated by Voodoo Lounge Falkirk will also be available. If you're feeling lucky, you can try your hand at the tombola or raffle prize draw!
