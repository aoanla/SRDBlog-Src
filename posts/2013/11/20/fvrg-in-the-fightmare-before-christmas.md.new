<html><body><p>On Sunday 15th December, <a title="FVRG Website" href="http://www.fvrg.co.uk/">Fierce Valley Roller Girls </a>are hosting a frightfully festive roller derby bout in Grangemouth Sports Complex.

The skaters will come up against each other in a FVRG vs. FVRG Christmas Special, with a classic Tim Burton theme: The Fightmare Before Christmas.

Since the venue is rather 'intimate', we recommend buying your tickets in advance to avoid disappointment. Remember to sign-up for a Kids Pass to allow those aged 14 and under to get in for free! Tickets are available from <a title="Buy Tickets Online" href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/510815" target="_blank">Brown Paper Tickets </a>at £5 per ticket (+ admin fee), or £7 on the door.

Doors will open at 3pm for a 3:30pm start. As always, there will be a selection of handmade crafts, home-baking and team merchandise for sale - perfect for any last-minute Christmas presents!
