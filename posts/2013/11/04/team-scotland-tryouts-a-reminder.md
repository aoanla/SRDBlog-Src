<strong>If you are unable to attend either session, then tryout by video submission will be possible. Contact Team Scotland via <a href="mailto:teamscotlandrd@gmail.com">email</a> or their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Team-Scotland-Roller-Derby/235701999922927">Facebook page</a> to arrange this.</strong>

The tryouts will be part drills part scrimmage and will be filmed for selection purposes. Those attending are asked to bring both a black and white scrim shirt, without league/team logos on it. This is a UKRDA guideline on tryout kit, to ensure impartiality on behalf of the selectors.

Eligibility for tryouts is dependant on possession of a British Passport. You are eligible to try out for Team Scotland in particular if you, or at least one parent or grandparent, were born in Scotland, or you are a current resident in Scotland with 4 or more years' residency. There are no requirements on membership of particular teams. Full details are available here: <a href="http://ukrda.org.uk/?p=567">http://ukrda.org.uk/?p=567</a></p></body></html>
