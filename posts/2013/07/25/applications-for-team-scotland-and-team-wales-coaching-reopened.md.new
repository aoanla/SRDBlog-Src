Applications for Scotland &amp; Wales National Team Coaching Positions OPEN until 31 August 2013.

UKRDA are pleased to announce we are re-opening applications for various positions in the Scotland and Wales Women’s Coaching Teams. UKRDA is currently processing Round 1 of applications which closed on 30 July, however we did not receive any applicants for the following positions and so are proceeding with Round 2 and accepting new applications for all of the following positions:

· Team Scotland Head Coach

· Scotland Line-up Manager

· Wales Head Coach

· Wales Assistant Coach

· Wales Line-up Manager

Last month Blood &amp; Thunder announced that the second Roller Derby World Cup is to be held in Dallas, Texas in December 2014. At UKRDA we are very excited about being appointed by BRSF to help get the official UK National teams up &amp; running.

The first step in making this happen is to appoint a Coaching Committee for each team. UKRDA will then work collaboratively with Coaching Committee’s to help develop and run fair &amp; transparent skater try outs and get team coaching sessions up and running. Although the day-to-day running of the teams will be in the hands of the Coaching Committees and skaters themselves, UKRDA will be on hand at every turn to offer support, guidance and oversight ensuring everything is running fairly and according to plan.

We’re looking for enthusiastic, committed and passionate people to join the Coaching Committee’s and work with us to ensure Team England, Team Scotland and Team Wales are the best they can be; to represent UK Roller Derby in style next December. Applicants' need a lot of drive, experience, knowledge of cutting edge roller derby, and the leadership &amp; communication skills to coach your team to success.
Come on UK Roller Derby... let’s smash last time’s results!

Round 2 will be open for applications between 22 July 2013 – 30 August 2013. Applicants need to return the application form linked below along with three letters of recommendation. Letters of recommendation can be from skaters/coaches &amp; leagues and must be from least two separate league sources. Applicants for coaching positions can be any nationality and be affiliated to any team, UKRDA members or not.
