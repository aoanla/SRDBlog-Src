<html><body><p>Derby fans, we choose YOU! On Sunday 28th July <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers">Bairn City Rollers</a> will evolve to present another double-header of action with Blockémon!

For round one, our lovely Central Belters will be hoping the <a href="http://www.furnessfirecrackers.co.uk/">Furness Firecrackers</a> don’t prove too hot to handle in what promises to be a searing battle between two great teams.

Next, the temperatures will reach fever-pitch as it will be time for round two where the Skelpies will be looking to quell the flames of <a href="http://www.furnessfirecrackers.co.uk/mensteam.php">Barrow Infernos</a>. If you can stand the heat you’ll be in for a treat, this one might get a little hot!

Skelpies, Infernos and Firecrackers . . .  all the elements are due to collide at the height of summer in an explosion of fun. Come on down and join us, you’ll have a (poké)ball!
