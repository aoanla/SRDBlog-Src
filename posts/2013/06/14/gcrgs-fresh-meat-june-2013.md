<strong>All we ask is that you are over 18, have a bit of gumption, a splash of spirit, a dose of commitment and a sense of humour.</strong>

We have skates and protective equipment all waiting for you to try on before the Derby Bug bites you and you rush off to buy yourself some pretty new gear :)

Joining GCRG is a brilliant way to get fit and meet new people!

Yes this is a women's sport but GCRG are on the look out for referees, so any guys who would like to get involved in the sport should pop along too!

See You on the Track!!

GCRG xx
