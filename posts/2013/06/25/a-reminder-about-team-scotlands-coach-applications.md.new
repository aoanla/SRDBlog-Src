UK Roller Derby Coaches - We need you!

UKRDA are recruiting key positions for the UK National Teams – applications for the positions of Head Coach, Assistant Coach, and Line-up Manager for Women’s Team England, Scotland and Wales are open NOW until midnight on Sunday 30 June 2013.

Last week Blood &amp; Thunder announced that the second Roller Derby World Cup is to be held in Dallas, Texas in December 2014. At UKRDA we are very excited about being appointed by BRSF to help get the official UK National teams up &amp; running.

The first step in making this happen is to appoint a Coaching Committee for each team. UKRDA will then work collaboratively with Coaching Committee’s to help develop and run fair &amp; transparent skater try outs and get team coaching sessions up and running. Although the day-to-day running of the teams will be in the hands of the Coaching Committees and skaters themselves, UKRDA will be on hand at every turn to offer support, guidance and oversight ensuring everything is running fairly and according to plan.

We’re looking for enthusiastic, committed and passionate people to join the Coaching Committee’s and work with us to ensure Team England, Team Scotland and Team Wales are the best they can be; to represent UK Roller Derby in style next December. Applicants' need a lot of drive, experience, knowledge of cutting edge roller derby, and the leadership &amp; communication skills to coach your team to success.

Come on UK Roller Derby... let’s smash last time’s results!
