</p><h5>So who are the teams?</h5>
<strong>Team Nitemare</strong> are a group of hand-picked male and female skaters from across the UK, chosen by <a title="Into the Nitemare Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/IntoTheNitemare?fref=ts" target="_blank">Into the Nitemare,</a> to represent co-ed roller derby. The double-header this weekend will be their debut appearance!

<strong>The Jakey Tayzers</strong> originated in 2012 when <a title="The Jakey Bites Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheJakeyBites" target="_blank">The Jakey Bites</a> and <a title="Dundee Roller Girls Website" href="http://dundeerollergirls.com/" target="_blank">Dundee Roller Girls' </a>Silvery Tayzers chose to join forces in Scotland's first ever co-ed bout against The Silvery Bites.

<strong>Hades Roller Boys</strong> appeared on the circuit in July this year as a male-only travel team. Similar to Team Nitemare, the skaters in this team originate from all over the UK and have been selected by the team founders.

<strong>Men Behaving Roller Derby</strong> are another 'exhibition' team - but their skaters hail from Ireland. Since their inception in February this year, MBRD have been busy recruiting new skaters; this bout will be their first public outing.

Tickets for the double-header bout are available online from <a title="Buy Tickets Online" href="http://newnitemare.eventbrite.co.uk/" target="_blank">EventBrite</a>, priced at £7. Since the Grangemouth Sports Complex is a small venue, they will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis online.
