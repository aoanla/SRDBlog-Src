<html><body><p>This is a plea on behalf of Fierce Valley Roller Cubs:  we realise that sourcing equipment for kids can be difficult, not to mention expensive, so with that in mind, we are asking if anyone would be willing to donate any old indoor wheels to our Cubs.  We can use these on their skates for indoor training, so their other wheels can be kept for outdoor practice. Sets of 4 or 8 wheels (starter wheels such as Caymens would be ideal) would be gratefully received.  If anyone is able to help, please contact us at cubs@fvrg.co.uk.  Thank you for helping the next generation of derby girls and boys get rolling!</p></body></html>
