After a number of delays and obstacles, planning for Fierce Valley Roller Cubs is firmly back on track.  As before, our main problem has been raising the money to cover the cost of insurance – vital before we start bringing kids in and letting them loose on skates!  We’re confident now though that we will be able to raise the money needed, in a number of ways.

Firstly, our brand new logo will be available on t-shirts and badges that we will be selling to raise funds for all of our set-up costs. 

Secondly, we will be selling the merchandise at our "big sister" league's first home bout. On Saturday 17th November, Fierce Valley Roller Girls' Parma Violents will play host to Wirral Whipiteres Roller Derby in For Whom the Skate Rolls, at The Peak in Stirling.  Members of the Cubs committee will be on hand to answer any questions people may have about junior derby, and to recruit some more potential Cubs.  Under-14s go free at the bout so it’s the perfect opportunity to bring the kids along.

Thirdly, with regards to a start date, we're aiming for Feb/March 2013. We know this is a while away, but starting an under-18s roller derby league has been more challenging than we first envisaged. We are the first league of its kind in Scotland, so have been doing this alone, and understand the importance of having everything in place before we begin, as keen as we are to get going.  Policies and constitutions are currently being written along with our training plans, and we hope to have these available at the start of 2013.

Finally, our coaches have all passed the WFTDA (Women's Flat Track Derby Association) minimum standards for derby skaters and are all experienced rollerskaters. Our coaches are all enhanced PVG checked.
