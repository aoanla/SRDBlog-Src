This Saturday, Dundee Roller Girls bring back roller derby to Dundee in a bout which sees them welcoming friends from across the water, Belfast Roller Derby.

These two teams have never met before, so the results are sure to be interesting.

Doors are at 2, with the game itself starting at 2.30, however we advise you arrive before this, as there will be plenty of stalls and cakes and other such lovely things to be enjoyed. You also wouldnt want to miss out on a seat at the suicide line.

Tickets are £5 in advance <a href="https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/247739" rel="nofollow nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/247739</a> or £6 on the door.
Under 14's admitted free when accompanied by a paying adult.

Come support your local team and embrace the full contact female sport that is Roller Derby!</body></html>
