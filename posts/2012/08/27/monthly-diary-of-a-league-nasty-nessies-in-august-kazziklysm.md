<strong>What first attracted you to Roller Derby?</strong>

A few of my friends had started training with the Nasty Nessies, and were talking about it on a night out. They badgered me to come along, so I gave in, and haven't looked back!

<strong>Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when you're starting out. How did you choose your name, and how does it reflect your personality on track?</strong>

I spent ages trying to think of something, and I asked loads of my friends for ideas. A good friend of mine suggested I use a play on words to incorporate my love of World of Warcraft, and the expansion pack Cataclysm, so I became Kazziklysm. I think it reflects the fact that im a destructive force on the track, that and when you know the story it shows I'm just a big geek at heart!

<strong>What was your biggest initial difficulty?</strong>

My biggest difficulty to begin with was my weight and general fitness level. At 17st and a size 22 i hadn't exercised in a very long time, but Derby is so much fun that I kept at it, and I'm now fitter than I have ever been (not to mention 2 st lighter)!

<strong>Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word?</strong>

I find it so hard not to speak about derby 24/7, it's like an odd compulsion. My Facebook is literally full of derby posts and I love telling people who have never heard about it before what the sport is all about. I've pestered all of my friends to join up, and working for the local newspapers, they've have been great popping in articles and pictures for me about the Nasty Nessies, raising our profile throughout the Highlands.

<strong>What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/ done this month?</strong>

This month has been a biggy for me: on the 23rd July I managed to complete my 25 in 5 (finally!) and pass my mins. We had a fantastic training session with [Glasgow Roller Derby's] Viper, who taught us so many new skills, drills and ways to improve our play.

<strong>What were the most difficult and the best things?</strong>

The most difficult thing was definately the 25 in 5. For a couple of months I had been getting closer and closer, and it was gutting to miss out just by a few seconds but the feeling of sheer elation and relief when I finally managed it was worth all of the failures. I can't pick one best thing, there are so many, but the team banter is right up there, and my lovely derby wife Desperate Measures, who makes me go to practice even on the odd occasion that i wanna be lazy and stay home!

<strong>What's new for the Nessies this month?</strong>

We're putting into practice a lot of the drills and skills Viper taught us, improving our game so hopefully we will be ready to skrim in the near future :D

 

Kazziklysm has nominated Schneck Breaker as the Nessies' diarist for next month, so come back then to see what she has to say!</p></body></html>
