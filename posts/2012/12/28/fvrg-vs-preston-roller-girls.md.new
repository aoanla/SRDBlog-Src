<html><body><p>The first bout of <a title="Fierce Valley Roller Girls on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/FierceValleyRG" target="_blank">FVRG</a>'s 2013 season will see the Parma Violents take on <a title="Preston Roller Girls on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/prestonrollers" target="_blank">Preston Roller Girls</a>! This will take place on Saturday 16th February, at The Peak Sports Village in Stirling.

The home team are setting themselves a challenge to make this event even bigger and better than their last visit to The Peak. Even though their previous bout clashed with pretty much every other Scottish Roller Derby team, Fierce Valley packed out the main hall in the sports centre and attracted lots of attention from the gym-goers and staff alike.

Doors open at 2pm, for a 2:30pm start. Tickets cost £5 in advance online via <a title="Buy tickets from Brown Paper Tickets UK" href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/312786" target="_blank">Brown Paper Tickets</a>, or £7 on the door. Under 14s are welcome to attend for free when accompanied by a paying adult.
