<html><body><p style="text-align:justify;">After the success of their Springtime Craft Fayre last year, <a title="Fierce Valley's Website" href="www.fvrg.co.uk" target="_blank">Fierce Valley Roller Girls</a> will be treating you all again to a hand-made, home-grown Craft Emporium! The event will be held in The Masonic Temple in Falkirk on Saturday 28th April from 12noon – 4pm, and will play host to a fine selection of around 20 local arts &amp; crafts stalls. Scotland’s first Junior Roller Derby league – Fierce Valley Roller Cubs – will also be there to share their future plans and answer any questions that kids (and their parents!) may have about the sport.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fundraising team at FVRG have pulled out all the stops to make sure there will be something for everyone at The Emporium. The crafters will be offering a range of handmade goods from jewellery, to greetings cards, to scarves, and even corsets and ‘skatergirlz’ art work.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/04/craft-fayre-2012.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022" title="The Craft Emporium Poster" src="http://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/04/craft-fayre-2012.jpg" alt="The Craft Emporium Poster" width="614" height="871"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There will be an elaborate bake sale for the sweet toothed, with tea and coffee also available. If you’re feeling lucky, then why not buy a raffle tickets to be in with a shot of winning vouchers from LMG Hair &amp; Beauty, or a set of books from Litlist Book Shop, or lampwork jewellery from Scarlett Impressions or Flaming Eck?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So what's it all in aid of?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As well as keeping you entertained for the afternoon, proceeds from the FVRG stalls at the Craft Fayre will help fund Fierce Valley Roller Girls team, ‘Parma Violents’, in their next bout. This will only be their second public outing, and they will be playing away against Belfast Roller Derby! For such a young league, going to Northern Ireland to represent Scottish Roller Derby is a huge opportunity, so all support received to help fund the trip will be hugely appreciated.</p>
