<div><strong>What first attracted you to Roller Derby?</strong></div>
<br>
<div><span style="color:#000000;">I hadn't heard of Roller Derby (yes I know, I lead a sheltered life!) before seeing 'Whip it', after watching I cursed living in Inverness where we never have anything decent to do and what do you know, a couple of months later it appeared in a local mag. I am not really a sporty type and RD just appealed to me because it looked such fun and a good way of getting fit without having to wear a leotard or running shoes!</span></div>
<br>
<div><strong>Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when\you're starting out. How did you choose your name, and how does it reflect your personality on track?</strong></div>
<br>
<div><span style="color:#ff0000;"><span style="color:#000000;">My name was the result of hours of err well, nothing! I could not think of any names that I liked or suited me, my hubby was coming up with some crackers but I am not sure my team mates would have liked shouting them out on the track! I ended up coming up with Bee-Yatch and obviously its a play on 'Bitch' but I actually play more on the Bee aspect as I wear yellow stripey socks, my helmet has Bee stripes on it and I can be a little 'stingy' if necessary!</span>
</span></div>
<br>
<div><strong>What was your biggest initial difficulty?</strong></div>
<br>
<div>
<span style="color:#000000;">My biggest difficulty was making my legs and feet do as they were told! I felt a bit like Bambi but in time have manged to overcome that (just!). I also had the concern that I was going to spend a lot of money on the initial gear layout and then might end up not liking it but thankfully that hasn't happened.</span></div>
<br>
<div><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about theirnew sport. How have you been spreading the word?</span></strong></div>
<br>
<div><span style="color:#000000;">I talk constantly about RD to anyone who will listen, in fact they don't even have to listen as long as they pretend!! ;-)</span></div>
<br>
<div><strong>What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/done this month?</strong></div>
<br>
<div>
<span style="color:#000000;">Endurance, endurance, endurance...and it really works. We have been putting a lot of effort into the basics and it has paid off. Personally I think it really helped me and got me through my 25 in 5 as without it I would never had made it within the time.</span></div>
<br>
<div><strong>What were the most difficult and best things you’ve done?</strong></div>
<br>
<div><span style="color:#000000;">For me getting over the nerves of being in a pack situation was quite difficult, I tend to over think things and wondered how I would ever get the nerve up to be able to get through a pack. Now when we do it I still get nervous but I use that energy to spur me on and I don't even think about what my feet are doing which is great. The best thing is being part of the team, we all help each other and encourage each other and everyone on the team wants NNRG to progress and become a team to lookout for.</span></div>
<br>
<div>
<strong>What’s new in NNRG?</strong>
</div>
<br>
<div>We have a couple of girls who are almost passed their MINs which is fantastic, we are also recruiting fresh meat and have had quite a bit of interest so hopefully we will be expanding again pretty soon. We seem to have come really far in the last 2 months and it feels great.</div>
