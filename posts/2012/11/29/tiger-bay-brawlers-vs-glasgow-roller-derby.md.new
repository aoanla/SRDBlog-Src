<a href="http://glasgowrollerderby.com/">Glasgow Roller Derby</a>'s Irn Bruisers,make the long trip down to Wales to take on the mighty <a href="http://brawlers.co.uk/">Tiger Bay Brawlers</a> for a long awaited rematch.The two first met almost eighteen months ago in a bout that GRD won by quite a margin.In the intervening time,both sides have grown a massive amount and some readers will remember a hugely impressive Tiger Bay side beating ARRG's Twisted Thistles earlier this year in Edinburgh.All of which should make for an interesting rematch.

The action takes place at Talybont Sports Hall, Cardiff on Saturday the 8th of December.Tickets are £9 on the door,or £7 <a href="http://brawlers.co.uk/tbb-v-grd/">in advance</a>.Doors open at 5pm and the first bout is at 5:30pm.
