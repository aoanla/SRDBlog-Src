<html><body><p>Fierce Valley Roller Girls are hosting a Christmas Craft Fayre in Falkirk town centre, on Saturday 8th December.

Their last event attracted a lot of interested in the local craft community, and the stalls have been quickly booked up again! The hall will be overflowing with glassware, jewellery, handmade cards (and more!) - perfect for finding a unique Christmas gift.
