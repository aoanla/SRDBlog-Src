<html><body><p style="text-align:left;">On Saturday 16th June, skaters from <a title="FVRG Website" href="http://www.fvrg.co.uk/index.php" target="_blank">Fierce Valley Roller Girls</a> will join forces with roller derby leagues from all over the country to raise money in a sponsored skate for <a title="Sports Aid Website" href="http://www.sportsaid.org.uk/" target="_blank">SportsAid</a>; a charity supporting the young British athletes of tomorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">To celebrate the London 2012 Olympics, <a title="Severn Roller Torrent Website" href="http://www.severnrollertorrent.com/" target="_blank">Severn Roller Torrent</a> from Gloucester were keen to organise a fundraising event that would raise awareness of their chosen sports charity, and also let the roller derby community pull together to reach their sponsorship goal. Over 60 roller derby leagues across the UK have been invited to take part over the weekend of 16th and 17th June by hosting their own event, and FVRG are proud to announce that they are one of them.</p>
