[<a href="https://wftda.com/rankings-may-31-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WFTDA Rankings May 2018</a>]

La Boucherie de Paris (aka Les Quads de Paris)[276]
GO-GO Gent Roller Derby[287]
London Rockin' Rollers[279]
Dundee Roller Derby[225]

The Dundee side are looking strong, coming off their 373 to 144 win against Glasgow Roller Derby last month[<a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/101336" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTS</a>], with the Rockin' Rollers coming in at 267 to 132 against the Glasgow side earlier this month in Tier 1 British Championships[<a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/99761" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTS</a>]. GO-GO Gent will be looking for a close rematch having played the Rockin' Rollers in tournament earlier this year; narrowly missing the win with 201 to 155 in favour of the Rollers[<a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/100250" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTS</a>]. With both Dundee and the Parisian team having not played the tournament attendees previously, it looks like a fantastic weekend of derby is upon us.

Dundee are taking their 15 skater strong Silvery Tayzer roster to the city of Paris in the hopes of making a name for themselves in the European derby scene. Previously DRD have played in Copenhagen, celebrating Copenhagen Roller Derby's 5th birthday in a DRD v CRD double header[<a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/96660">FTS</a>]. The Parisian tournament is an excited step forward for the Dundee side in opening game avenues for WFTDA sanctions for their recent full WFTDA membership.
