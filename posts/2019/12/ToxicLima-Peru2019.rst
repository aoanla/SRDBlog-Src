Whilst 2x4 and Sailor City have made Argentine Roller Derby more familiar to the kind of audiences who only follow Division 1, there's been Roller Derby *across* South America for longer than they might expect.

Since 2010, Peru has hosted Roller Derby in the form of its only league, Toxic Lima Roller Derby. We have been lucky enough to be able to talk to one of their longer-standing members, Berenice [check name she wants to use], about the history, and present, of Roller Derby in Peru.
