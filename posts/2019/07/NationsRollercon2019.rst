For the last few years, the Nations Tournament has become a fixture of Rollercon, after its founding in 20xx

This year was a particularly important point in the tournament's history, as two borderless nations - Team Indigenous Rising, and the new Jewish Roller Derby - competed in the tournament, and even played each other.

The Nations tournament is run as an efficient double-elimination bracket, with seedings voted on by the competing teams.
