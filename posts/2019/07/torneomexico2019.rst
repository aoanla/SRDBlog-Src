Last year, as part of our `series`_ on National Tournaments around the World, we brought you up to date with `Mexico`_'s Championships and ratings - one of the longest running
national tournaments in Roller Derby.

With the 2019 edition of the Championships arriving very soon now, we thought it was time to catch you up on events.

.. TEASER_END

The 8th Mexican National tournament, as always, is organised by the `AMRD`_, the sport's governing body in the country. Seeded from the last published AMRD ratings
[ ], Division 1 will take the same 2 Playoffs into Final structure as in 2018.

AMRD tries to spread playoffs across the country, so Playoff 1 will be hosted in Chihuahua, whilst Playoff 2 will be centrally located in Mexico City; in the 2nd and 4th weeks of August, respectively; whilst the Division 1 final will be in Querétaro in mid November.

Division 2, being smaller, retains the final fixture for its determination: this year hosted in Guanajuato, in early October.
