The Short Track Roller Derby events calendar is building for the year already, and there's a lot of things to talk about, so we're bringing you a new edition of the Short Track News roundup earlier than we expected to!

Our first development is that `Rolla Skate Club`_ now host a dedicated `Short Track Roller Derby Resources`_ page, with the rules and other info.
(We expect it to gain additional translations soon - Russian and Arabic (and Polish) translations all exist, and Spanish is in progress!)

In the USA, the biggest Short Track event upcoming is probably the `Rollercon`_ event series. Building on their appearance at the last Rollercon (the public debut of the ruleset, in fact),

.. _Rollercon: http://rollercon.com

Rollercon 2019 will feature multiple items:
  - "AA-level" Short Track Exhibition Game "Short Skirts versus Sleeves" (20 July, 20:45)
  - 2 MVP-pass holder on Skates sessions on Short Track with Rolla Skate Club [19 July 16:50, 20 Jul 18:00]
  - Open Track Scrimmage for Short Track (19 July, 20:00)

If you're at Rollercon from the 17th July, then we encourage you to go check it out!

Many other US and Canadian teams continue to use Short Track Roller Derby; Pittsburgh Short Track Roller Derby, in particular, continue to be a purely Short Track league, and are holding regular open training sessions.

In Canada, we know that `Nelson Killjoys`_ of British Columbia, will be hosting a tournament for 6 teams, at some point this year.

In Alberta, Canada, `Fort McMurray Roller Derby`_ are planning to use short track rules for their home teams season, allowing them to support more home teams with their current roster. (Scheduled for around October 2019)

  see the furthest-north Short Track (and WFTDA) event of the set.

This is Orkney ViQueens' first ever hosted event, so it's a chance to be part of history.

This is also a great excuse to see Orkney! Orkney ViQueens have some accommodation options to reduce costs for officials and skaters, and are working on other cost reduction, as well.

Officials can sign up for all parts of the event here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMpk7DjRyF5tykoKTVX6wv4fShIWc4y4exfGD_MiMVWcxr9g/viewform

(Travel to Orkney, for people outside Scotland, is easiest via ferry from Aberdeen on the afternoon of the 15th (around £32 each way on foot), although flights are possible as well (but are much more expensive); for Norwegian visitors, there are also flights direct from Bergen to Kirkwall but only on Saturdays - it's easier to fly via Aberdeen, and not much more expensive (although flying to Aberdeen and then taking the ferry to Orkney is even cheaper).)
