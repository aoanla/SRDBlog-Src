Most excitingly, perhaps, the 16th to 18th August see the furthest-north Short Track (and WFTDA) event of the set.

`Orkney ViQueens Roller Derby`_ host a three-day event, with:

.. _Orkney ViQueens Roller Derby:

- Short Track and WFTDA Rules Officiating Clinic (run by Theminist Killjoy) [16th]
- Open-To-All genders WFTDA-rules double header [17th]
- Open-To-All genders Short Track-rules tournament (up to 8 teams) [18th]

This is Orkney ViQueens first ever hosted event, so it's a chance to be part of history.

This is also a great excuse to see Orkney! Orkney ViQueens have some accommodation options to reduce costs for officials and skaters, and are working on other cost reduction, as well.

Officials can sign up for all parts of the event here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMpk7DjRyF5tykoKTVX6wv4fShIWc4y4exfGD_MiMVWcxr9g/viewform

(Travel to Orkney, for people outside Scotland, is easiest via ferry from Aberdeen on the afternoon of the 15th (around £32 each way on foot), although flights are possible as well (but are much more expensive); for Norwegian visitors, there are also flights direct from Bergen to Kirkwall but only on Saturdays - it's easier to fly via Aberdeen, and not much more expensive (although flying to Aberdeen and then taking the ferry to Orkney is even cheaper).)
