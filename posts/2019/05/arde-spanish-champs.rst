Whilst it's not true for every country, the history of National Tournaments in Roller Derby is often tied up with legitimate organisation and representation within that nation. (For example: the French
Championnat is, in a sense, what it is, *because* it is backed by the FFRS).

Whilst Spain has had a `national tournament`_ since 2016, this was run by the Spanish Skating Federation. That body, as with several around the world, does not well reflect the interests of Roller Derby, having a particular alignment with World Skate.

As such, attendance at the Campeonatos has been dropping steadily since they were initiated.

From last year, however, Roller Derby in Spain has legitimate representation. The `Asociaci칩n de Roller Derby de Espa침a`_ (ARDE - which also nicely means implies "fire" and "passion") represents the WFTDA-rules and WFTDA-aligned teams in Spain (of all gender and age policies).

This year, then, there is finally a more representative Spanish National tournament, backed by ARDE.
With ARDE's greater inclusion, there's enough teams to require two divisions for the WFTDA-gender tier;
a single division Men's tier will also provide a MRDA-gender champion.
