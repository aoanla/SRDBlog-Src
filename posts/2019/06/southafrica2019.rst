We've written a bit about South African roller derby when covering their `national tournament`_, but there's a lot more to be said about the community than that.

Geography informs the way in which Roller Derby develops in a country, and South Africa's is very different to what we're used to in Europe.

South Africa is a large country - its area is about twice that of France - but with a relatively small population - about 80% that of France. And that population is very unevenly spread across the country: the dense province of Gauteng, containing Johannesburg and Pretoria contains about a quarter of South Africa's entire population, with another fifth concentrated around Durban in the south-east province of KwaZulu-Hatal, and a further eighth around Cape Town in the Western Cape.

Unlike in most European countries, then, the 4 leagues of South Africa - located in those 4 named cities - have difficulty even travelling to play each other on a regular basis.

Add to this the fact that the only other country with Roller Derby in Africa is Egypt, at the other end of the continent, and you can get a feel for how dedicated and unique the solutions adapted by the South African leagues have had to be.
