Reffeweizen:

  I'm Elizabeth Cahill on FB, and my derby name is Reffeweizen. I spent most of the day in the classroom. There aren't too many officials in China or Asia. I only know of 3 others in China/Hong Kong. I ended up working with someone from Shanghai (Malika) who wants to be a dedicated official! And some fresh meat who couldn't participate in contact drills came in and learned more about this side of things. It was really exciting to see officiating grow! We ended up tweaking some of the short-track rules to accomidate that I wanted to provide wftda-style training for those interested in officiating since it's rare to get a chance to work on that.
  1. We only went derby direction.
  2. Skaters who had penalties just got called on them (so the PT could track them). They didn't lose a point, and they couldn't avoid getting called on a penalty by choosing to yield.
  3. Also, we used WFTDA penalty metrics and a 'Jerkface' penalty got called as a 'blocking out of play.'
  4. Because I wanted the SKs to look for lead jammers (one is also a skaters, so they might could be a JR in the future), the initial pass was worth 0 points, but the lead jammer got 1 point.

  We ended up doing 2 periods of 15 jams so that people could rotate through jammer evenly. After 30 jams, the score was 66-66. After the tiebreaker jam, it ended with 66 to 69.

  We're looking forward to having another bootcamp with a scrimmage/tournament at the end next year. It's great knowing that Short Track is an easily teachable, usable format that we can consider!
