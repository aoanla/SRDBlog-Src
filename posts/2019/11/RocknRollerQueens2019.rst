A little delayed, due to there being so much stuff, we'd like to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first Roller Derby League in Colombia: Rock N Roller Queens. Starting back in 2009, RRQ were the start of a rapid swell of Colombian roller derby - over the following two years, a full 10 leagues had come into existence, many (including RRQ) based in the capital, Bogotá, but also across the other cities.

With the rapid growth of Roller Derby in Colombia, their first National Tournament was held in 2012, and the Rock n Roller Queens won, defeating second place Bogotá Bone Breakers (who were also the second league to form in the country). The following month, July 2012, they also made history by being accepted as the first ever South American league to join the WFTDA Apprentice program. They were also one of the few leagues in Colombia to have both A and B teams, with their Queens

In Bogotá's "District Tournament", which ran from 2014 to 2018 so far, both of RRQ's teams competed, with good placements, as well as hosting fixtures.

From 2014 to 2016, as full WFTDA members, RRQ's travel team actively participated in WFTDA Sanctioned Play, with a consistent performance (taking into account the rapid growth of leagues, and the inherent inflationary nature of WFTDA Ratings year-on-year). In the last few years, no Colombian team has achieved a WFTDA ranking...

...however, on their 10th anniversary, RRQ told us that they have plans to change this. Over their lifespan, the Rock n Roller Queens have undergone what they refer to as "important generational changes", and the new league are planning to make a splash on the WFTDA Sanctioned tournament circuit in 2020.

As part of this, Rock n Roller Queens are also planning a rebranding exercise, which will be open to artists across the world. (We *hope* that this won't be expecting the artists to work for free...).

We're looking forward to RRQ's


Como liga cumplir 10 años significa que hemos trabajado duro por mantenernos fuertes y unidos haciendo Roller Derby en Colombia, pues venimos de un proceso fuerte de transformación acompañado de cambios generacionales importantes, que hacen que ahora seamos un grupo renovado, que no para, que la da toda en cada entreno y que quiere seguir guerriándola en competencias dentro y fuera del país; a propósito de lo último, te contamos que nuestro objetivo principal es volver a ranquear en la WFTDA el próximo año, pronto sabremos en qué torneo y lugar tendremos la posibilidad de participar y nos encantaría que nos sigan apoyando a través de su blog y todo lo que se les ocurra.

Por lo pronto, presentaremos toda la nueva generación que nos acompaña, tendremos un cambio importante en nuestra imagen e involucraremos artistas de todas partes a que participen en este cambio, celebraremos nuestros X años con la segunda versión de nuestros Derbynaldos (un evento navideño para toda la comunidad de Roller Derby, donde competimos y premiamos al mejor equipo y mejores jammers y bloques) y para cerrar con broche de oro: nuestra fiesta de aniversario, con la que buscamos reunir fondos para que viajar a rankear, sea mucho más sencillo.

Eso es todo por ahora, tan pronto tengamos confirmada nuestra participación en un torneo WFTDA, ¡te lo haremos saber!


Muchas gracias por siempre estar pendiente
