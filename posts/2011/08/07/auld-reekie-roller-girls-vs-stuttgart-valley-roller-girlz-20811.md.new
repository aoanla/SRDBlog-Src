<html><body><p>The second of ARRG's Edinburgh Festival bouts gets under way at Meadowbank Sports Centre,London Road Edinburgh on the 20th of August 2011.
Doors Open 2pm,Entry is a measly Â£5.Tickets will go fast for this one and are probably best to be <a href="http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/events/auld-reekie-roller-girls-present-live-roller-derby">booked in advance</a>

<a href="http://www.arrg.co.uk/">ARRG</a> won the bout the last time the two teams met,so the Stuttgart girls will be hungry to even the score,should make for a great bout.
