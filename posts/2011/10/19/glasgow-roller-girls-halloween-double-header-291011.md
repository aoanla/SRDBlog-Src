The first bout will be between GRG's Maiden Girders and The <a href="http://www.crimecityrollers.com/">Crime City Rollers</a> of Malmo,Sweden.CCR were formed in March 2010 and like GRG are <a href="http://wftda.com/">WFTDA</a> Apprentice Leagues.In their last bout,CCR hosted a double header against Stockholm Roller Derby and The Berlin Bombshells and won both games,so this should be an interesting one.
The second bout of the day sees GRG's Irn Bruisers vs <a href="http://www.rcrg.co.uk/">Rainy City Roller Girls</a> from Manchester.Again this will be a great bout,Rainy City have been around since 2008 and are a superb team.They also have two skaters who are in the Team England squad for the forthcoming World Cup,Missy Rascal and Dee-Mise.So it provides a chance to see them in action!
