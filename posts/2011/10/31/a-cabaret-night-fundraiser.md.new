<strong>So what's it all in aid of?</strong>

Proceeds from the Cabaret Night will help the league raise vital funds to cover training costs; raise their public profile to attract new skaters; and help their team, Parma Violents, compete in bouts all over the country.

This is an extra special fundraiser where FVRG will also donate a slice of the profits to help our Scottish referees - Ella Bella Bang Bang and Cherry Fury - get to the Blood &amp; Thunder World Cup in Toronto.
