Team USA will play no warm up bouts other than a 14 on 14,Stars V Stripes expo bout in Toronto the night before the World Cup starts.They only have two team practices scheduled,but such is the calibre of their skaters they probably don't need much time to gel as a team.
The eagle eyed among you will have noticed that there is no final, set in stone game roster.Instead Team USA  have a team roster of 28 players with 6 alternates from which to chose a final team,but quite frankly,you could pick twenty skaters at random from that line up and still have a world class squad.The only real problem for USA team selection is that many of their skaters will be taking part in the <a href="http://wftda.com/tournaments/2011/championships">2011 WFTDA Championships</a>.Any injuries picked up during the Championships could rule out skaters for the World Cup which is only two weeks later.
