The sheer size of the country and the cost involved in travel means that Team Australia have not played any warm up bouts or been able to have the entire team together for any practise time.However,many of their skaters are from experienced and well established leagues and may not need much time to gel as a team,plus they will be eager to show everyone that down under Derby is a force to be reckoned with.</body></html>
