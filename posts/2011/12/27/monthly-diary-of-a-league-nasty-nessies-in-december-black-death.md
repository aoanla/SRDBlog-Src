<strong>What first attracted you to Roller Derby?</strong>
<div>

Um.............Skating &amp; Violence of course.

<strong>Derby names are an important aspect of the sport, especially when</strong> <strong>you're starting out. How did you choose your name, and how does it </strong><strong>reflect your personality on track?</strong>

Choosing my name was real easy for me coz Black is my surname &amp; I love Death Metal......Simples.

<strong>What was your biggest initial difficulty?</strong>

</div>
Getting a babysitter for my wee girl on a regular basis coz missing practice is a right Bitch!!

<strong>Lots of roller girls find it hard not to spread the word about their new sport. How have you been spreading the word?</strong>

I wear the NNRG badge with pride and talk about the sport to whoever will listen.

<strong>What’s the most important thing you’ve learnt/done this month?</strong>

I've learnt that Smoking, Drinking &amp; too much Partying does affect your stamina.

<strong>What were the most difficult and best things you’ve done?</strong>

Difficult: Doing this daft move our coach calls the 'Duck-Walk', it's like a jump start move which I can do but if i think about it too much i'm screwed.

Best Things: The best thing without a doubt is joining NNRG &amp; meeting all the girls in the team.
We all have such different lives and probably wouldn't have met if it wasn't for the great sport of roller derby!

<strong>And, finally: what’s new in NNRG?</strong>

Well, we've got a lot of new girls starting in the team all with keen interest.  We also have an interview &amp; photo shoot coming out in the Inverness Courier.  But my favourite thing is that we are just about to decide on what uniforms the team will wear. Woohoo. x
