<html><body><p>For our first interview of the year, we thought we'd follow up on the spread of Roller Derby across Europe - whilst European Derby is very strongly represented in the West of the continent, as we move east, the sport is still really in the process of getting established.

So, we talked to two leagues which are still at the edge of the expanding wave of Roller Derby, <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/RigaRollerDerby/">Riga Roller Derby</a></strong> (representing Latvia) and <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Tartu-Roller-Derby-331686066967827/">Tartu Roller Derby</a></strong> (representing Estonia) - the leagues have recently started collaborating on "Baltic Roller Derby" practices to share their resources.

You can listen to the interview here (we're working on a transcript to be available later):
