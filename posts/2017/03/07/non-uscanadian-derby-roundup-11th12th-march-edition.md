<html><body><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is traditional, we're bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we're using <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"><span class="s2"><b>Flat Track Stats</b></span></a> for much of this information - for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/16-Dec-ranking.html"><span class="s2"><b>SRD Rank</b></span></a> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men's bouts). Our new SRD Rank is out - the first for this year, and now includes Junior leagues where possible, and a lot more Latin American leagues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we've missed you from our roundup, please let us know!</span></p>

<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Scotland</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1">The roller derby starts in Scotland a day early this week...</p>

<ul class="ul1">
	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">On Friday, Dundee Roller Girls are hosting Aberdeen's Granite City Roller Derby for a quick game. Both teams have significant contributions to the national squad (4 from DRG and 3 from GCRD) so this will probably be a close game! [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/node/89842">FTS</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1851962628353425/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS gives Dundee the edge, but it's definitely not set in stone.)</span></li>
	<li class="li3">and on Saturday, Glasgow Roller Derby host an all-day event to celebrate their 10th Birthday, including a triple-header of bouts [Rookies, Coed and Advanced Women's categories], a roller disco and general celebration. [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1875166969385996/">EVENT</a></strong>]</li>
</ul>
<h2>UK</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As will be the case for the next few months, most of the bouts in the UK are part of British Champs:</span></p>

<ul class="ul1">
	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Wirral Roller Derby host the Tier 2 North, the hosts playing Manchester Roller Derby, and hosting Newcastle's Whippin' Hinnies against Rainy City's Tender Hooligans.[<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/88819/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/662407963966093/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS considers the hosts' game to be very close, but gives advantage to Rainy City in the second)</span></li>
	<li class="li3">Wiltshire Roller Derby host the Tier 4 East, the hosts taking on Vendetta Vixens of Northampton, and Oxford Wheels of Gory playing Suffolk Roller Derby [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/88821/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1075508129241985/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS favours Vendetta and Suffolk)</li>
	<li class="li3">and in Wales, South Wales Silures host the Tier 1 Men's, with a bout against the Crash Test Brummies. [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/88822/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1901456593422229/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS can't predict this - SRDRank favours the hosts)</li>
</ul>
Outside of Champs:
<ul>
	<li>In (greater) Manchester, Rainy City Roller Derby host Auld Reekie Roller Girls in the final Scottish derby event of the day. [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89392/overview">FTS</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/222301338237222/">EVENT</a></strong>] (Given Rainy's reputation at present, it's not surprising FTS gives the home team the advantage.)</li>
	<li>London Rollergirls are launching their season with a double header, as London B, the Brawl Saints, challenge Crime City B [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89394/overview">FTS</a></strong>], whilst London C face Liverpool Roller Birds [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89393/overview">FTS</a></strong>] [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1228831763821201/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS gives the advantage to the Brawl Saints in the B game, but thinks the Liverpool game will be very close.)</li>
