<html><body><p>After a break from podcast style interviews, Scottish Roller Derby podcasts are back with an interview with one of the co-chairs of new Men's Roller Derby National team, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TMErollerderby/"><strong>Team Middle East Roller Derby</strong></a>.

Team Middle East are actively recruiting for any skaters with eligibility to represent any of the Middle Eastern countries, with an aim to compete in the 2020 Men's Roller Derby World Cup. This would make them the first men's team representing any nations in the middle east, and only the second team representing a Middle Eastern Nation at all (after <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TeamIranRollerDerby/"><strong>Team Iran Roller Derby</strong></a> - also still open to applicants - who will represent at the Women's Roller Derby World Cup 2018).
