This time they will be focusing on how officials, on or off skates, can work together as a team. Working on communication and how each individual contribute to the smooth (and safe!) running of the game. With the off skates session covering the ever popular position of Penalty Tracking!

To round the night off DRG's officials will be inviting you to take these newly hones skills onto the track as the bootcamp officiates Dundee's very own skaters in a wee intraleague scrim!

One half of Dundee Roller Girls' Head of Officials, Tiny Tearaway, had this to say about the bootcamps. Catch her and the other DRG refs in teaching action on the 28th!

I'm really grateful to help set these up and be a part of it all."  </em>(Image Courtesy: Allyson Jane-Foster)
