<html><body><p>With both World Cups now less than a year away - the<a href="http://www.rollerderbyworldcup.com/"><strong> Roller Derby World Cup</strong> </a>in February, and the <a href="http://mrdwc.com/"><strong>Men's Roller Derby World Cup</strong></a> in April, there's an increasing number of National Teams related fixtures being announced, as all the teams get in some practice, some visibility, and some fundraising opportunities.
