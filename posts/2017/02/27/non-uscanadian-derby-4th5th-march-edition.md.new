<html><body><p>As is traditional, we're bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we're using <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">Flat Track Stats</a></strong> for much of this information - for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching.

Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/16-Dec-ranking.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men's bouts).

If we've missed you from our roundup, please let us know!
</p><h2>Scotland</h2>
As far as we know, there's no fixtures in Scotland this weekend.
<h2>UK</h2>
As will be the case for the next few months, most of the bouts in the UK are part of British Champs, which we will start with:
<ul>
	<li>the Tier 1 Men's continues with Tyne and Fear Roller Derby hosting New Wheeled Order for a single bout [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89859/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1299107823484732/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS can't predict this, but SRDRank gives the hosts a slight advantage.)
