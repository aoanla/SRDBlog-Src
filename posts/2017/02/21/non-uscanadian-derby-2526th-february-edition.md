<html><body><p>As is traditional, we're bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we're using <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">Flat Track Stats</a></strong> for much of this information - for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching.

Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/16-Dec-ranking.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men's bouts).

If we've missed you from our roundup, please let us know!
</p><h2>Scotland</h2>
No bouts we're aware of, but:
<ul>
	<li>Lothian Derby Dolls have a new skater tryout session on Sunday [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1268108103227678/">EVENT</a></strong>]</li>
	<li>and on the coming Tuesday, Fierce Valley Roller Girls are hosting a fundraising scrim [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1307299952693559/">EVENT</a></strong>]</li>
</ul>
<h2>UK</h2>
As will be the case for the next few months, most of the bouts in the UK are part of British Champs:
<ul>
	<li>Tiger Bay Brawlers are hosting the Tier 1 fixtures on Sunday, themselves playing Leeds Roller Derby (who we interviewed here), and Birmingham Blitz Dames facing Bristol.[<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/88818/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/241620336288289/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS generally favours Tiger Bay and Birmingham - although predictions about Leeds are v unsure, given their merged roster.)</li>
	<li>Furness Firecrackers, meanwhile, are hosting the Tier 3 North, with North Wales Roller Derby playing the hosts, and Aberdeen's Granite City Roller Derby taking on Halifax Bruising Banditas [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/88820/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/297370800677088/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS favours Granite City, and considers the hosts' bout to be pretty close, with just a slight advantage their way.)</li>
</ul>
Outside of Champs, there's a few other bouts going on, some of a more international flavour:
<ul>
	<li>Croydon Roller Derby are hosting a double header against Hamburg's Harbor Girls, with the A teams [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89189/overview">FTS</a></strong>] and B teams [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89190/overview">FTS</a></strong>] both competing. [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1379485302082983/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS calls the A bout as pretty close, the B bout less so, both in the hosts' favour)</li>
	<li>Cornwall Roller Derby is hosting Oxford Roller Derby [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89191/overview">FTS</a></strong>] in a double-header topped by a co-ed mixed game. [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/775763642575167/">EVENT</a></strong>] (A perfect 50:50 chance of a win for each team, by FTS!)</li>
	<li>And South Wales Silures, fresh from their first games in British Champs, are hosting a triple header, inviting over Toulouse' Quad Guards to play both the hosts [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89222/overview">FTS</a></strong>] and Manchester Roller Derby [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89221/overview">FTS</a></strong>], sandwiched around Newport's Riot City Ravens competing against Manchester's Furies [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89220/overview">FTS</a></strong>]. [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/242254232882013/">EVENT</a></strong>] (The mighty Quad Guards are the favourites here, with Riot City favoured for the women's bout.)</li>
	<li>On the Sunday, Rainy City Roller Derby are hosting Dublin Roller Derby [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89391/overview">FTS</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1732540897059885/">EVENT</a></strong>] (Whilst Dublin are very strong, it is perhaps unsurprising that FTS favours Rainy City here.)</li>
	<li>London Rockin' Rollers are hosting a closed bout with Hamburg's Harbor Girls, after their Croydon bouts the day before. [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89710/overview">FTS</a></strong>]</li>
	<li>and finally, Big Bucks High Rollers are hosting a closed bout with Hereford's Hell's Belles [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89992/overview">FTS</a></strong>]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Europe</h2>
In Europe, there's the usual mix of national championships and individual fixtures:
<ul>
	<li>As usual, on both Saturday and Sunday, the French Nationale continues, with the Division 1 games hosted by Rennes and featuring the hosts, Orcet, Toulouse B, Nantes B,Saint-Gratien's Panthers Graou and Montpellier[<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/86043/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1835574003381910/">EVENT</a></strong>]</li>
	<li>Sweden is also hosting tournament fixtures on both days, as the Seriespel Division 1 sees Västerås host themselves, Örebro, Karlstad and Stockholm B in the next round of the tournament[<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/88014/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/253603408402296/">EVENT</a></strong>] (Stockholm B is the clear favourite here, followed by hosts Västerås)</li>
	<li>On Saturday, Roller Derby Iceland are hosting Karlsruhe's RockARollers [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/88729/overview">FTS</a></strong>], as European teams continue to like the exotic [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1708628599428104/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS favours the visitors here.)</li>
	<li>Roller Derby Madrid are hosting a double header, with the hosts B team against Madrid's Black Thunders [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89965/overview">FTS</a></strong>], and also playing London exhibition team, Team Dragon [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/174041149760253/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS favours the hosts.)</li>
	<li>also in Spain, Valencia's Rayo Dockers are hosting Bergamo's Crimson Vipers [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/90581/overview">FTS</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1675081419459147/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS favours the hosts)</li>
	<li>And in Germany, Stuttgart Valley Rollergirlz are hosting the exhibition team, the Baloney Ponies [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/90086/overview">FTS</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/243763806076414/">EVENT</a></strong>]</li>
	<li>and finally, in Belgium: Charleroi's Renegades are hosting a double header, hosts against Namur C[<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/90088/overview">FTS</a></strong>] and Men's team Manneken Beasts against the exhibition team, Unnamed Basterds [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/90087/overview">FTS</a></strong>] [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1248551415230623/">EVENT</a></strong>] (This may be Charleroi's first bout, making them unpredictable!)</li>
	<li>In France on Sunday, Roller Derby Calais are hosting a triple-header, with their Juniors (Dread Dragibus) playing Unnamed Bambinos of X, women's team Black Tagada taking on Tournai's Rolling Zombie Dolls [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89953/overview">FTS</a></strong>], and men's team Zombeers facing Team Belgium Men's Roller Derby (fresh from their bout in Scotland last weekend)[<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89954/overview">FTS</a></strong>] [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1216794021737724/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS favours Tournai, but cannot predict the Men's bout.)</li>
	<li>And in Amiens, the Rolling Candies are hosting a double header - the A team facing Caen A [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89996/overview">FTS</a></strong>], and the B team facing Rouen B  [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1804687763118234/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS favours the visitors for the A bout; Amiens have chosen not to have their B team on FTS, so we have no official record of any of their scores.)</li>
	<li>Over in Belgium, Namur are rushing from their Saturday bout to host their own double-header on Sunday, with Namur A against Brussels' Derby Pixies [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/node/90655">FTS</a></strong>] and B against Brussels B (the Atomium Kittens) [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/node/90656">FTS</a></strong>] (FTS favours Brussels in both cases, although not overwhelmingly.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pacific</h2>
Whilst Australia and New Zealand are in their pre-season period, there's one Pacific bout we know about:
<ul>
	<li>Devil Dog Derby Dames, of Okinawa, are hosting a Valentine-themed home game [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1038581489580259/">EVENT</a></strong>]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Latin America</h2>
In Argentina, at least, there is Roller Derby this weekend:
<ul>
	<li>2x4 Roller Derby hosts a triple header, with Bloody Furias playing Dirty Fucking Dolls[<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/90070/overview">FTS</a></strong>], the Bully Chicks playing Wonderclan [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/90071/overview">FTS</a></strong>], and Cowgirls From Hell taking on an unnamed mixed team [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1467544189957512/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS cannot predict Latin American games... and since the 2x4 Teams are listed as Home Teams, they are not included in SRD Rank either.)</li>
</ul>
