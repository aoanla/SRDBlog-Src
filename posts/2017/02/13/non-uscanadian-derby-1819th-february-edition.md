<html><body><p>As is traditional, we're bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we're using <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/">Flat Track Stats</a></strong> for much of this information - for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching.

Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/16-Dec-ranking.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men's bouts).

If we've missed you from our roundup, please let us know!
</p><h2>Scotland</h2>
As far as we know, there's only one Scottish roller derby fixture this weekend (but see the Other Events section for exciting things in Edinburgh):
<ul>
	<li>On Sunday, Glasgow Men's Roller Derby are playing their first public bout, hosting Barrow Infernos [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89499/overview">FTS</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1256068267811568/">EVENTS</a></strong>], ahead of their British Champs appearances. (This bout is part of their progress in joining MRDA.) (FTS can't predict this; based on their single result, SRD Rank predicts a loss for the home team, but with low confidence.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>UK</h2>
As will be the case for the next few months, most of the bouts in the UK are part of British Champs:
<ul>
	<li>In Manchester, the Tier 2 North starts off, with both of the newly-added B teams playing: hosts Rainy City Roller Derby's Bet Lynch Mob against Wirral, and Newcastle's Whippin' Hinnies against Cambridge Rollerbillies. [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/88819/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/233103117140662/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS predicts wins for the host, and for Cambridge.)</li>
	<li>In Nottingham, the Tier 3 West begins, with hosts Nottingham playing the Leicestershire Dolly Rockits, and Sheffield Steel v Wolverhampton Honour Rollers [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/88820/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1536356949726161/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS predicts two very close games, with the hosts' game particularly knife-edge.)</li>
	<li>and finally, in Lincolnshire, the Tier 4 East kicks off, with hosts Lincolnshire Bombers against Suffolk, and Wiltshire against Oxford Wheels of Gory [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/88821/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/660414010802712/">EVENT</a></strong>] (the hosts are making the most of the booking, with a roller disco to finish off). (FTS predicts wins for Suffolk and Wiltshire.)</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>Europe</h2>
In Europe, there's the usual mix of national championships and individual fixtures:
<ul>
	<li>On Saturday and Sunday, the French Nationale series continues with the second half of the Men's Qualifiers hosted by Roller Derby Avignon, as Grenoble's Quadstrators, Orcet, Mâcon, Dijon's La Raclée , Metz &amp; Strasbourg's Team Rock'Est and Lyon's Mon Cherrry contest for placements.[<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/89601/overview">FTS Tournament</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1185765091540606/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS can't predict these bouts. SRD Rank favours Orcet, and considers the rest pretty closely matched.)</li>
	<li>In Oslo, there's a triple header, as Oslo Roller Derby invite Dresden and Norrköping for three bouts on Saturday[FTS <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89385/overview">1</a></strong>,<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89386/overview">2</a></strong>,<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89387/overview">3</a></strong>] [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1842875322592978/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS expects the hosts and Norrköping to be close enough that it's hard to call which will win overall.)</li>
	<li>And in Namur, Belgium, there's a double-header, as Namur B play Mons' Freaky Mons'ter Girls [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89339/overview">FTS</a></strong>]  while Namur A take on Utrecht's Dom City [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89340/overview">FTS</a></strong>] [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1366113893461750/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS expects a double win for the hosts.)</li>
	<li>Frankfurt, Germany hosts a double-header too, as the hosts Bembel Town play Vagine Regime Central Europe [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89748/overview">FTS</a></strong>], followed by South German Men's Roller Derby versus DHR (the Kiel/Aarhus Men's team)[<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89248/overview">FTS</a></strong>] [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/412903085714247/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS can't predict either bout, due to exhibition teams not being rankable.)</li>
	<li>The double-headers continue in Amsterdam on Sunday, as the hosts A play the Rolling Candies of Amiens [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/88647/overview">FTS</a></strong>] and their B team contests Roller Derby Twente [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/88646/overview">FTS</a></strong>] [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1773769862910924/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS expects a win for Amsterdam A, but a loss for the B team)</li>
	<li>Also, in the Netherlands, on Saturday, The Hague's Parliament of Pain B (the Jokers) host Rotterdam's Killer Bees [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/88648/overview">FTS</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/196881797393517/">EVENT</a></strong>] (FTS expects the Bees to take it.)</li>
	<li>On Saturday, in Trondheim, Norway, Nidaros B are playing Bergen's Wet City Rollers [<strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/88929/overview">FTS</a></strong>][<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/604967973033340/">EVENT</a></strong>] This is Wet City's first bout, so we can't predict a winner!</li>
	<li>In a late addition: as part of their 7th Birthday celebrations, Paris Rollergirls are hosting a bout against Vagine Regime Europe.[<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/710437312455419/">EVENT</a></strong>] See below for more details on the full event.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pacific</h2>
As far as we know, the Pacific Region is still in the recruitment and training phase of its current season.
<h2>Latin America</h2>
We're not aware of any events in Latin America this weekend. (This doesn't mean that there's nothing going on, though - we're still improving our mechanisms for detecting bouts in this area.)
<ul>
	<li>Proof of this: last minute addition for the first bouts of the 4th Torneo Distrital de Roller Derby (in Colombia), today [19th Feb] [<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TorneoDistritalRollerDerby/photos/rpp.389372221268075/687125418159419/">EVENT</a></strong>]</li>
