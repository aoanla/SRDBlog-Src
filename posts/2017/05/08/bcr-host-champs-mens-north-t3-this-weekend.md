Unfortunately for BCR's Skelpies, they have picked up a few more injuries at their first game. This has left them with an even smaller roster than they had in Dublin; due to this they have decided to forfeit their game with GMRD, awarding GMRD the win.

However, BCR will be drafting in a few guests to fill in the gaps in their squad thus allowing a game to be played and the event to remain a double header. The game will not count towards Champs, of course, but will still be great derby!

Teeside vs Men Behaving Derby will be a great fight. Teeside will be looking to to get their first points on the board, whilst Men Behaving Derby will be looking to take another win to consolidate their place at the top of the table.
