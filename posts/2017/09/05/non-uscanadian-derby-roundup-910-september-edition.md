<html><body><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is traditional, we’re bringing you another roundup of the upcoming Roller Derby this weekend from across the world. As always, we’re using <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/"><span class="s2"><b>Flat Track Stats</b></span></a> for much of this information – for regions with less good coverage, we also do a bit of intensive searching using a tool which scans the Facebook events of Roller Derby leagues known to <strong><a href="http://derbylisting.com/dl/grid/">Derby Listing</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Predictions of bouts are from FTS, if possible, and from our own <strong><a href="http://aoanla.pythonanywhere.com/SRDRankv2.html">SRD Rank</a></strong> where FTS cannot make predictions (for example: Latin America, or non-MRDA men’s bouts).  (SRDRank also has recent WFTDA rankings, including the 31st June ranking, as well as SRDRank, and allows you to make predictions from them.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’ve missed you from our roundup, please let us know! [Or add yourselves to FTS and/or Derbylisting]</span></p>
