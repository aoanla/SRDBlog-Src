</strong> DRG's<em> Silvery Tayzers</em> will be building on their win from last months Seaside Sirens game <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/91484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[FTS]</a> by taking on Leicestershire's <em>Dolly Rockit Rollers</em>!

As always with Dundee double headers, DRG's B team, the <em>Bonnie Colliders,</em> will be taking to the track first to face off against the Scarborough Slammers! After a strong season opener against Arcadia Roller Derby [<a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/89734/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FTS</a>], as part of <em>Shepsk8: For Pulmonary Fibrosis,</em> the Colliders will be looking to stand out in their first home game this year.

The two roller derby games will be alongside the usual merch and vendors stalls, including businesses from the local community. As well as the forever popular Cake Stall, boasting sweet and savoury choices! DRG are hoping to run a few hook-a-duck games and a tombola!
