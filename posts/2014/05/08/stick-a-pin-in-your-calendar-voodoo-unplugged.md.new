While there's a huge amount of exciting roller derby happening this month (Internationally, and otherwise), sometimes you may need a break.

Luckily for you, Voodoo Roller Dollies are holding the Voodoo Unplugged event on May 29th, providing an evening of acoustic music from local bands.

Tickets are £5.

More information can be found on the event page on Facebook:

Funds raised from this event will go towards future VRD bouts. The Dollies are also running a GoFundMe page to specifically raise money for their planned away bout against Belfast. You can donate to that here: <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/8s3j64">http://www.gofundme.com/8s3j64</a>
