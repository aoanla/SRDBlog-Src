<html><body><p style="text-align:justify;">On Sunday 8th June in Grangemouth Sports Complex, skaters from <a title="FVRG on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/FierceValleyRG" target="_blank">Fierce Valley Roller Girls</a> will become fierce opponents for the day in a comic book themed game!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An intra-league event gives leagues the chance to welcome their newer skaters on track - and this time, Bammy Zuko and Gotham Nicky will be skating alongside past and present Parma Violents.</p>

Team Marvel will be playing in white, with Team DC in black - but I bet there will be some kit-customisation on the day as the skaters embrace this colourful theme!
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since Grangemouth Sports Complex is a bit tight for space, it is recommend that you buy your tickets in advance to avoid disappointment. Tickets are priced at £5 online from <a title="Buy Tickets Online" href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/708167" target="_blank">Brown Paper Tickets</a>, or £7 on the door. Kids under 14 go free with a paying adult.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doors will open at 3.30pm for a 4pm start. As always, there will be a selection of handmade crafts, home-baking and team merchandise for sale.</p>
