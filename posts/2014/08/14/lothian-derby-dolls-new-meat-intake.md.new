<html><body><p>It's that time again when the Dolls open their house for some tender new meat.
Lothian Derby Dolls are holding a <strong>taster session for new skaters</strong> who are interested in seeing what the sport can do for them, what they can achieve in the training programme and give you some <em><strong>experiences you won't forget</strong></em>. This intake session is not just limited to those who want to play on the track as roller derby skater. We are hoping any budding <strong>Non Skating Officials or Referees</strong> to come along and take part in our training programme.
If you live in the Lothian area and want to give the taster session a go or know someone who does get in touch.
<strong>Sunday 24th August</strong> at <strong>Musselburgh Leisure Centre</strong> from <strong>1pm - 3pm</strong>.

Please get in touch prior for more details and confirmation of your place for this taster session. A new skaters training programme will start shortly after at the start of September following the taster session.
