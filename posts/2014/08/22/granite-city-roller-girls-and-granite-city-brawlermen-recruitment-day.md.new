Granite City Roller Girls and Granite City Brawlermen are recruiting!

Saturday 6th September is an exciting day for Roller Derby Recruitment in Aberdeen with not one but two intakes!

First up, Granite City Roller Girls are holding their intake day at Aberdeen Lads Club (Dill Road) from 11:00-13:00. Then from 13.30 to 15.30 the Brawlermen will be welcoming new recruits as well!

Both GCRG and GCB have experienced coaches who can teach people of all levels so no skating experience is necessary and we can provide equipment - please drop us a message on Facebook to let us know what shoe size you take so we can make sure we have skates for you on the day!

GCRG are also on the lookout for referees so any ladies or gents who would like to get involved with this aspect of the sport should pop along too!

Roller Derby is a brilliant way to get fit and meet new people! All we ask is that youâ€™re over 18 years old, wear non restrictive clothing and bring plenty of water.

Put on some skates, be your own hero!

For more information please email newrecruits@granitecityrollergirls.org.uk or granitecitybrawlermen@gmail.com
