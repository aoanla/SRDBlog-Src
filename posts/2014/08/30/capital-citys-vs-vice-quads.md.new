Capital City are taking things a step further this time, hosting their first home bout and Edinburgh’s first ever men’s headline bout on the 29<sup>th</sup> of November. Their opponents the Vice Quads from Bristol will be making it another first with their trip over the border into Scotland, with what should be a great hard fought game from both sides. If this was not enough, the event is also going to be a double header.

Capital City have teamed up with Auld Reekie Roller Girls to bring you an epic opening game. Capital City are proud to welcome Malm<span class="null">ö</span>’s Crime City Roller's B Team all the way from Sweden who will take on ARRG’s Cannon Belle’s.
