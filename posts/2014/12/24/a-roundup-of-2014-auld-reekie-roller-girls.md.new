2014 was another exciting year for ARRG. <em>January</em> saw us embark upon our third annual intraleague
Home Season - and, as we’ve witnessed for the past two years, we saw the Skatefast Club and the
Leithal Weapons make it to the final, but this year, for the first time, the amazing Skatefast Club took
the title! <em>February</em> was a busy month of training for us all, and in <em>March</em> the Twisted Thistles played a
closed game against Tiger Bay Brawlers, and won.
<em>May</em> saw the Thistles head off to Oregon to compete in the <a href="http://thebigotournament.com/">Big O</a> tournament, whilst our Cannon
Belles took on Newcastle at home, and won. We had our annual awards ball in <em>June</em>, which is an
amazing celebration of our work both on and off skates, and a lovely excuse to get dressed up and
have a night out. In <em>August</em> we played our annual Fringe games, first our Belles took on Dirty River
Roller Girls and then the Thistles faced London Roller Girls Brawl Saints. Sadly we were defeated on
both occasions, but the Belles did not <em>feel</em> defeated and they went on to beat Hamburg at home in
<em>September</em>. Nor were the Thistles, who also came out with a win when Royal Windsor Rollergirls
came to play.

Then, the Belles headed off to Oslo for a tournament with some really highly ranked opponents;
Oslo Roller Derby and Dock City Roller Girls. The tournament was incredibly hard and both games
saw us defeated, but we fought hard for every point, coming home and ready for the last game of
the year against Malmo’s B team, ending the year on a high with a comfortable win. [And, of course, quite a few Thistles travelled across to Dallas as part of Team Scotland, as well as one in Team Belgium.]

And so another year ends, but this time with some BIG changes afoot for 2015. First and most
excitingly, the Thistles and Belles are no more! We have retired these names and as of January 1st,
the teams will be known as the Auld Reekie Roller Girls All Stars and All Star Reserves. This is an
exciting movement forward for us, and we are super excited. We’ve also seen big changes with our
home season, which is now taking place at the end of the year, from September to November. By
the time it comes around, we’ll have a massive number of new skaters in the league so it will
definitely not be one to miss.

We’ve also got a lot of really exciting games planned for this year, including being part of the <a href="http://www.britishchamps.com/">British</a>
<a href="http://www.britishchamps.com/"> Championship</a> Premier League where we will play with the other top 4 leagues in the UK to battle it out for
the top spot! Look out for more information on that.

We hope to see more and more fans at our home games, and for more information on the fixtures, check on arrg.co.uk or for any enquiries, email <a href="mailto:communications@arrg.co.uk">communications@arrg.co.uk</a>.

Here’s to 2015!</body></html>
