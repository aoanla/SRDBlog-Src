<html><body><p>So thinking all the excitement is over for the year in Roller Derby you would be wrong.
This weekend Lothian Derby Dolls are hosting a charity bout at Meadowbank. Raising funds for 2 selected charities Alzheimers Scotland and Children's Hospice Association Scotland.

The main event will be a face off between the Golden Oldies a team comprised of 40's and over and the Whipper Snappers a team made up of 25 an unders.

This will be for sure an interesting match up do you think experience will win this bout? Or will the eagerness of the young energy win it.

Of course we aren't just going to leave those aged in between out so we are also holding a bout for them to not miss any of the action.

YES!! A double header all in aid of not just one good cause but two.

<strong>Doors open at 12pm</strong>

<strong>Meadow bank Sports Centre, Edinburgh</strong>

<strong>Tickets - Online £8</strong>

<strong>                On the door £9</strong>
