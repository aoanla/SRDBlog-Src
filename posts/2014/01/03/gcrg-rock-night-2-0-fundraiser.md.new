I'd advise you to duck tape your socks down because they are likely to get rocked off!!!...

Returning from the previous rock night we welcome back <strong>Laid Back</strong>.

With a list as long as both of your arms put together Laid Back are a covers band not to be missed!.. ( Rage against the machine, Guns n Roses, Wheezer, Queens of the Stone Age, Kings of Leon, The Killers, The Cult, Foo fighters, Queen, ACDC....I could go on!!!)

Due to unforeseen commitments the Ruckus have had to pull out of Rock night...but not to worry, we have....*drum roll* Voodoo Vibe!!

<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;"><strong>Voodoo Vibe</strong> are a four piece cover band that play anything from The Rolling stones to The White stripes. If you liked to know more you can give them a like here or check out their web page.</span>
