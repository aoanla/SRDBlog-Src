Absolutely no skating experience is necessary as the CCRD coaches will teach you basic safety and skating skills. Skating equipment will be provided for on the night, but participants are asked to buy and bring along their own mouth guard.

So if you want to get involved in one of the world's fastest growing sports and have a good time while you're at it contact, please contact <a href="mailto:newskaters@capitalcityrollerderby.co.uk">newskaters@capitalcityrollerderby.co.uk</a> to reserve your place at this Fresh Meat event.
