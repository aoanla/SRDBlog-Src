<html><body><p>On Saturday 26th April, <a title="Fierce Valley Roller Girls on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/FierceValleyRG" target="_blank">Fierce Valley Roller Girls</a> will be heading to Lancashire to take on <a title="Preston Roller Girls on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/prestonrollers" target="_blank">Preston Roller Girls</a> in their return bout.

The two teams last met in February 2013 at The Peak in Stirling. Although Fierce Valley took the win in 'Love Hurts', it was a tough bout and came right down to the last jam. Both teams have come up against some stiff opposition over the past year - with both celebrating wins and losses - and they'll be bringing all of that experience onto the track with them in April. It's all to play for in this year's 'Block Stock and Two Smokin' Jammers'!

Preston Roller Girls will be hosting the bout in Preston College Sports Hall. Doors open at 2:45pm for 3:30pm start. There will be home-baking and team merchandise for sale.

Advanced tickets will be available shortly via Big Cartel. Join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/623798847687043/?ref=5" target="_blank">Facebook Event </a>for full details.
