<html><body><p>On Saturday 26th April, <a title="FVRG Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/FierceValleyRG?fref=ts" target="_blank">Fierce Valley Roller Girls</a> will be heading to Lancashire to take on <a title="https://www.facebook.com/prestonrollers?fref=ts" href="Preston%20Roller%20Girls%20Facebook%20Page" target="_blank">Preston Roller Girls</a> - and they want you to join them!

The two teams last met in February 2013 at The Peak in Stirling. Although Fierce Valley took the win in ‘Love Hurts’, it was a tough bout and came right down to the last jam. Both teams have come up against some stiff opposition over the past year – with both celebrating wins and losses – so it's all to play for in this year’s ‘Block Stock and Two Smokin’ Jammers’!

If you would like to cheer on the Parma Violents in their next bout, there are still seats available in their hired bus.  The return journey costs £18 per person. The coach will leave from the main car park in <a title="Grangemouth Sports Complex" href="http://www.falkirkcommunitytrust.org/venues/grangemouth-sports-complex/" target="_blank">Grangemouth Sports Complex</a> at 8am sharp on Saturday 26th April, then after the action-packed bout, the coach will leave Preston to head back home at 9pm. The travel time is approx. 3 hours 20 minutes each way, plus a rest stop.

To reserve your seat on FVRG's Coach Trip, please email <a title="Email FVRG" href="mailto:%20BoutManagement@fvrg.co.uk">BoutManagement@fvrg.co.uk</a> with your name and contact details. Seats will be reserved on a first-come, first-served basis. Payment will be taken on the day.
