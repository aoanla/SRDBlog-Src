Voodoo played their first game in March against The Flaming Noras in Furness - and won with 205 pints to 155! The team are hoping to continue with their success and have been working hard in preparation for their first game at home where they will take on Preston Roller Girls.

The day itself is guaranteed to be fun-filled, with a Rocky Horror Picture Show theme. Fancy dress is actively encouraged and prizes will be awarded for best costume.

Doors open at 12:30. Join the <a title="Voodoo vs Preston Facebook Event" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/290841551085852/" target="_blank">Facebook Event</a> for more details.
