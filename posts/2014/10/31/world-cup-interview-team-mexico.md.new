<html><body><p>"Are you a Mexi-can or a Mexi-can't?" asked Machete in the 2010 movie of the same name.

Danny Trejo's character wasn't talking about roller derby, but if he had been then one group of players at this year's World Cup would most definitely deserve the term 'Mexi-cans'.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TeamMexicoRollerDerby">Team México Roller Derby</a> are aiming to leave Dallas reeling when they bring their fabulous footwork and sizzling skills to the track against the world's top teams.

This will be the first time the proud and passionate country has been represented on the world stage in this way and they are ready to add the lightning to Blood &amp; Thunder!

Scottish Roller Derby caught up with skater Renny Rumble to look forward to the Texas showdown.
