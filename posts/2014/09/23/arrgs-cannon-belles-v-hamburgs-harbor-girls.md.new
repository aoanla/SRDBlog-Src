<html><body><p>On Saturday 27th September, <a title="ARRG on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/auldreekierollergirls" target="_blank">Auld Reekie Roller Girls</a>' Cannon Belles will welcome <a title="Harbor Girls on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/harborgirls" target="_blank">Harbor Girls</a> from Hamburg at Meadowbank Sports Centre, Edinburgh.

Already this year the Cannon Belles have played against Newcastle's Whippin' Hinnies; Dirty River Roller Grrrls from Turku, Finland; and Birmingham Blitz Dames. The Belles have been growing from strength-to-strength, so this is a game not to be missed!

Doors open at 2pm, with the skate outs starting at 2:30pm. Tickets can be bought online from <a title="Buy Tickets!" href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/856791" target="_blank">Brown Paper Tickets</a> for £7, or can be bought on the door if you prefer.

The 'vendor village' will be open for business before the game and at half-time, selling a wide range of ARRG merchandise - including new Limited Edition lines - and of course, cake!
