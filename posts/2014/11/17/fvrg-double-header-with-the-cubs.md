<html><body><p>On Saturday 13th December, <a title="FVRG Website" href="http://www.fvrg.co.uk" target="_blank">Fierce Valley Roller Girls</a> will be hosting a double-header event, featuring Scotland's only junior roller derby team - the Fierce Valley Roller Cubs!

The 4 teams playing in the event will represent the Hogwarts Houses from Harry Potter: The Cubs will be split between Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, and the adult skaters will be in either Gryffindor or Slytherin.Both The Cubs and FVRG have competed in their own intra-league games earlier this year, but this is the first time that the two will play in the same event.

The double-header will take place in Grangemouth Sports Complex. The hall doors will open at 3pm for a 3:30pm start - plenty of time to browse the stalls and the bake sale before the action starts.

Tickets are priced at £6 (+admin fee) from <a title="Buy Tickets" href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/956261" target="_blank">Brown Paper Tickets</a>, and kids under 14s go free with a paying adult. If there are still tickets left on the day, they will be sold for £8 on the door.
