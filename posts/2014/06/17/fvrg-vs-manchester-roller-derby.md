<html><body><p>On Saturday 28th June, Fierce Valley Roller Girls' travel team, Parma Violents, will be playing host to <a title="Manchester Roller Derby Website" href="http://manchesterrollerderby.com/" target="_blank">Manchester Roller Derby</a>'s B-Team, Furies. The roller derby game will be played in Grangemouth Sports Complex: doors open at 3:30pm for a 4pm start.

This event will mark the Parma Violents' third home game of the year, but it will be first time that these two teams have met. The Parma Violents won against Glasgow's Cannie Gingers, but lost to Newcastle's Whippin' Hinnie - so it's all to play for!

There will a selection of team merchandise, crafts and home-baking for sale.

Tickets are £5 in advance when purchased from <a title="But Tickets from BPT" href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/724835" target="_blank">Brown Paper Tickets online</a>, or £7 on the door. Under 14s gain free entry with a paying adult.
