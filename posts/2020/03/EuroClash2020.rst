Speaking of Roller Derby Firsts, technically this weekend marks the first ever tournament hosted by `Newcastle Roller Derby`_ (UK). This is a very technical point,
as Newcastle's finest Roller Derby league have hosted EuroClash before - just under their previous name of Newcastle Roller Girls - but it's a good enough excuse for us to
write a quick lead in article...

This year's EuroClash is just as international as previous years, but is running as a 1 day event at Newcastle's famous Walker Activity Dome.

With 5 teams attending, and 5 games in total, this is a tournament in the looser sense of "a number of games in one place"; no overall winner will be decided. As with most WFTDA-Recognised tournaments,
the point is to make it easier for all the teams to achieve their WFTDA Sanctioned Games quota by having several at once (and also get to do that by playing interesting teams in a nice place).

This year's attendees are, along with their ratings in `WFTDA`_ and `DerbyStats.eu`_

.. csv_table:: Teams! Ratings as of 9 March.
  :header: Name, WFTDA Rating, DerbyStats.eu Rating

  Birmingham Blitz Dames, 313.12, 882.3
  Brussels Roller Derby, 264.23, 923.2
  Nottingham Hellfire Harlots, 303.71, 941.3
  Newcastle Roller Derby, 193.14, 880.6
  Oslo Roller Derby, 282.31, 889.9

As can be seen, DerbyStats' ranking (which is very closely related to Flat Track Stats' in its underpinnings) differs in ordering from WFTDA's at several points - most strikingly with Brussels and Birmingham. Unfortunately, a matchup between those two teams isn't on the cards for this EuroClash, but there is certainly potential for upsets in bouts which are scheduled.

In addition, the bouts which are scheduled form a connected graph (if you draw lines connecting each pair of teams playing in a game, the resulting image is a closed pentagon), so it is possible for us to perform post-tournament statistical analysis and estimate what the overall ordering of strengths would be.

On a Scottish note, whilst it's sad to see no Scottish *teams* competing at EuroClash this year, the Scottish officiating community is doing well, with 3 referees and 3 NSOs representing.

As always, EuroClash will be live-streamed, and as a WFTDA Recognised tournament,
