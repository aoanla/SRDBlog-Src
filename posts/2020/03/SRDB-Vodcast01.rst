As with many of our readers, we at SRDB have been trying to make the best of the current global situation. With competitive Roller Derby on-pause, this presents a great opportunity to take stock and catch up with the state of the sport around the world.

In this vein, then, we're launching a new Vodcast series - hopefully a long-lived run of video chats with skaters around the world about derby in their country. As our opening episode, we caught up with 6 members of the Italian Roller Derby community to discuss the sport in their country, a new initiative for bringing the leagues together; and also to watch one of the 30-minute games from the 2018 Roller Derby World Cup - as Italy took on Team Indigenous!

You can catch the Vodcast here, or on YouTube:

and we'll be updating this with an audio-only version in the future.

The entire Series Playlist is here, if you don't want to miss out on future episodes: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsfV1BOiVrnF5TiOOxaWE696A_59gz1sp

(Our apologies for the quality - this is a slightly rough first go, and we'll have better audio mixing in the next episode.)

If your region would like to be part of this project, please email us at scottishrollerderby@gmail.com to discuss - we'd love to hear from you (and help the world hear about you too)!
