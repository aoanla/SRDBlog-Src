A few weeks ago, we debuted the first of a planned series of SRDB Vodcasts, as we host chats with the Roller Derby community around the World.

We're back today with the fifth edition, featuring the Roller Derby community in Scotland, with reps from Glasgow Roller Derby, Auld Reekie Roller Derby (Edinburgh), Inverness City Roller Derby, Granite City Brawlers (Aberdeen) and Lothian Roller Derby (Midlothian)

Highlights include footage from 2020's WFTDA European Continental Cup, Game 2, where Auld Reekie Roller Derby played (Australia's) Perth Roller Derby. Thanks to WFTDA for allowing us to use this footage.

We've embedded the video here so you can watch it without needing to go to YouTube:

and we'll be updating this with an audio-only version in the future.

The entire Series Playlist is here, if you don't want to miss out on future episodes: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsfV1BOiVrnF5TiOOxaWE696A_59gz1sp


If your region would like to be part of this project, please email us at scottishrollerderby@gmail.com to discuss, or get in touch via our Instagram or Facebook pages - we'd love to hear from you (and help the world hear about you too)! We're currently working on 3 regions for new Vodcasts, but we don't have a limit as yet.
