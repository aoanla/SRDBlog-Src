A few weeks ago, we debuted the first of a planned series of SRDB Vodcasts, as we host chats with the Roller Derby community around the World.

We're back today with the sixth edition, featuring the Roller Derby community in Central Mexico, with reps from Aniquiladoras, EMEXRD (Discordias and Disorder), Fugaz Roller Derby, Mexico City Roller Derby, Quimeras Roller Derby, and from the Asociación Mexicana de Roller Derby, Mexico's NGB.

Highlights include footage from 2020's Luna Cup tournament (hosted by Aniquiladoras, and filmed by Mexican Roller Derby streaming superstars, Derby Wife) where MCRD played Discordias, and a discussion of just how much Mexican derby has managed in the past decade, including one of the longest running National Tournaments in international Roller Derby.

We've embedded the video here so you can watch it without needing to go to YouTube:

and we'll be updating this with an audio-only version in the future.

If your region would like to be part of this project, please email us at scottishrollerderby@gmail.com to discuss, or get in touch via our Instagram or Facebook pages - we'd love to hear from you (and help the world hear about you too)! We're currently working on 3 regions for new Vodcasts, but we don't have a limit as yet.
