A few weeks ago, we debuted the first of a planned series of SRDB Vodcasts, as we host chats with the Roller Derby community around the World.

We're back today with the fourth edition, featuring the Roller Derby community in the Baltic States (Latvia and Estonia) and Russia.

Highlights include footage from 2019's Fab Slav (the 3rd Baltic/Slavic Roller Derby Sevens tournament, hosted by Warsaw Roller Derby), an extended discussion of Short Track roller derby, and a conversation about the best skate shop in Riga.

Due to technical issues (the laptop we use for the video call bluescreened in the middle of the call), there's an edit about 12 minutes in. We apologise for this issue.

We've embedded the video here so you can watch it without needing to go to YouTube:

and we'll be updating this with an audio-only version in the future.

The entire Series Playlist is here, if you don't want to miss out on future episodes: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsfV1BOiVrnF5TiOOxaWE696A_59gz1sp


If your region would like to be part of this project, please email us at scottishrollerderby@gmail.com to discuss, or get in touch via our Instagram or Facebook pages - we'd love to hear from you (and help the world hear about you too)! We're currently working on 3 regions for new Vodcasts, but we don't have a limit as yet.
