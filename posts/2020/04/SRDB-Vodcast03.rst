A few weeks ago, we debuted the first of a planned series of SRDB Vodcasts, as we host chats with the Roller Derby community around the World.

We're back today with the third edition, featuring the Roller Derby community of Hawai'i.

Highlights include footage from 2019's Battle of the Islands (Hawai'i's state tournament), discussion of future directions for derby in Hawai'i [and how it's developed over time], and some Team Indigenous news towards the end!

We've embedded the video here so you can watch it without needing to go to YouTube:

and we'll be updating this with an audio-only version in the future.

The entire Series Playlist is here, if you don't want to miss out on future episodes: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsfV1BOiVrnF5TiOOxaWE696A_59gz1sp


If your region would like to be part of this project, please email us at scottishrollerderby@gmail.com to discuss, or get in touch via our Instagram or Facebook pages - we'd love to hear from you (and help the world hear about you too)! We're currently working on several regions for new Vodcasts, but we don't have a limit as yet.
