A few weeks ago, we debuted the first of a planned series of SRDB Vodcasts, as we host chats with the Roller Derby community around the World.

We're back today with the seventh edition, featuring the Roller Derby community in Poland, with reps from Bad Rangers Poznań Roller Derby, Gdańsk Chrome Sirens Roller Derby, Smokin' Wheels Krakow Roller Derby, Team Poland Roller Derby, Vratislavia MadChix Roller Squad, Warsaw Hellcats Roller Derby and Warsaw Hellbadgers Officials Squad.

Highlights include footage from 2020's FAB SLAV Slavic/Baltic Roller Derby Sevens tournament, and from 2019's Mayday pan-Polish Short Track Roller Derby tournament, a discussion of the history of the sport in Poland, and their plans for the future.

We've embedded the video here so you can watch it without needing to go to YouTube:

and we'll be updating this with an audio-only version in the future.

The entire Series Playlist is here, if you don't want to miss out on future episodes: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsfV1BOiVrnF5TiOOxaWE696A_59gz1sp


If your region would like to be part of this project, please email us at scottishrollerderby@gmail.com to discuss, or get in touch via our Instagram or Facebook pages - we'd love to hear from you (and help the world hear about you too)! We're currently working on 3 regions for new Vodcasts, but we don't have a limit as yet.
