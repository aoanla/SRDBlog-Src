<html><body><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;">For your last chance to catch the Silvery Tayzers in action this year, <strong>Dundee Roller Girls</strong> host a single header on <strong>Saturday 8<sup>th</sup> </strong>of<strong> October</strong>. After an unforeseen turn of events causing a scheduling change for the Silvery Tayzers, they now take on a new travel team branded “<strong>Crazy Vagine</strong>”. This mighty force has been forged from two well-known travel teams that play across the UK,<strong> Vagine Regime</strong> and <strong>Team Crazy Legs</strong>.</span>

Team Crazy Legs formed in September 2013, to open possibilities to any member of the roller derby community; be they skater, ref, announcer, NSO or fan; affected by chronic illnesses or mental health issues. They strive to create positive vibes and discussion points to challenge the stigma of mental health, inside and outside of derby.

Vagine Regime UK launched in 2012 and forms a fully inclusive travel team of LGBTQ derby individuals! Spawning from the original Vagine Regime of the USA (formed in 2008), this community is a tag team of queer skaters from leagues all across the UK promoting queer visibility within out sport.

For the first time ever, we see these two almighty clans band together to take on Dundee Roller Girls' A team, The Silvery Tayzers. For an epic showcase of talented skaters and an unmissable derby game, come along to the <strong><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/DISC:+Dundee+International+Sports+Centre/@56.4762665,-2.9611212,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48865cfd69198245:0x74e93fd03837f5ac!8m2!3d56.4762665!4d-2.9589272">D.I.S.C.</a></strong> in Dundee.
