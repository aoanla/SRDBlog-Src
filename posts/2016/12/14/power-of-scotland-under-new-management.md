<html><body><p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PowerOfScotland/"><strong>Power of Scotland</strong> </a>(Scotland's National Men's Roller Derby Team) Management and Coaching Team elections are complete, and there's some new faces, and some returning ones, in the mix; as well as a few new positions. The new team will be managing Power of Scotland as they prepare for the 2018 <strong><a href="http://mrdwc.com/">Men's World Cup</a></strong> in Barcelona.

We're going to give you a rundown of the Positions and their holders:
</p><h2>Team Manager - Nikki Morris</h2>
Returning to the role of Team Manager from the 2016 squad, Nikki is also a member of the MRDWC Committee, playing a strong role in progressing the International game itself.
When she's not involved with the International game, Nikki is a manager of Granite City Brawlers, Aberdeen's open Roller Derby league.
<h2>Bench Coach - Laura "Milky" Liston</h2>
Milky is also returning from coaching PoS to the World Cup in Calgary this year. Now something like a quadruple threat, as referee, coach, blocker and jammer, she's also on the (Women's) Team Scotland Training Team, and is still one of Dundee Roller Girls' top skaters. She also has the distinction of having Bench Coached Madrid's Mad Riders at Men's European Cup 2016, despite not speaking Spanish.

<h2>LUM Coach/Line Up Manager - "McDonagh"</h2>

<h2>Support Coaches - rEd Baron, Phoenix</h2>
<em>These two new positions were added this time around, to provide additional coaching support.</em>

rEd Baron was on the roster for the 2016 World Cup in Calgary, as well as for the original 2014 team that played in Birmingham. When he's not on the National Team, he skates for and coaches at Bairn City Rollers (the Skelpies debuting in British Champs T3 North Men's this year), and has provided support for many other teams, including Team Scotland.

Phoenix is currently a member of Glasgow Men's Roller Derby (British Champs T3 North) [MRDA's rules are very gender accepting], having transferred from Glasgow Roller Derby, where she was a rostered A-team skater, this year. She has extensive coaching experience from her time in GRD, and is also a member of the Team Scotland Training Squad.
<h2>Head Official - Mags Payne</h2>
Returning from last time, Mags Payne will be providing her experience and contacts to the National Team, arranging officials for their practices and any bouts along the way, as well as keeping them in line. When she's not providing her knowledge to PoS, Mags referees for Auld Reekie Roller Girls, and also contributes to the WFTDA Rules committee.

<h2>Team Photographer - Laura MacDonald</h2>
Our final position, and another returnee.
