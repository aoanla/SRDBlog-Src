<html><body><p>As you're probably aware, the second ever<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/talkderby/"> Talk Derby To Me</a></strong> Listener Awards are currently up for votes, with an extended set of categories since last time.
Several of those categories were added to allow nominations for roles which are frequently under-represented, and less visible, than those of Skaters - Referees, NSOs, Announcers and so on.

However, it became somewhat clear that one of the issues with NSO awards is that... well, NSOs are less visible (some of them would argue that if they're visible, they're doing it wrong), and less public than Skaters, and people don't really know what the nominees were have been doing. And many of them have been doing a huge amount, and some very big things - as well as being necessary for the running of every game (and even more important for tournaments, where there's geometrically increasing amounts of organisation needed), they're also in the background keeping stats and data safe and up to date, both locally and in shared community resources like Flat Track Stats.

So, in the spirit of the Award itself, we've given each Nominee for the NSO Award a small (too small!) amount of space to say something about what they did this year... which we've topped with a brief description of their association and history. NSOs were also given the opportunity to provide a photo - if they didn't, we've applied the universal NSO placeholder!

NSOs are covered in the order they appear in the <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXySN7hUTbQGCepCzq5ifeS5qK9dglaRXZxchv0kymMGuzUg/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">TDTM Awards Voting form, here</a></strong>. We've added their "actual" NSO name after their name on the form, if it differs.
