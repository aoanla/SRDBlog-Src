<html><body><p>Whilst the current WFTDA Championships structure provides the opportunity to win the Hydra once a year, commentators have pointed out to us that there's other sports where Championships pass rather more easily.

In particular, Boxing allows Championship Belts to be won by anyone successfully defeating the holder, at any point in time.

So, we thought it might be interesting to see what would have happened to a "Dust Devil Cup" under the same rules; imagine <em>Texas Rollergirls</em>, winners of the first ever modern Roller Derby tournament, the <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/tournaments/3475"><strong>Dust Devil Cup</strong> </a>in <strong>2006</strong>, passing it on to whoever next defeated them, and on and on up to the present day?

Well, you get a rich and varied look through the history of Roller Derby, like this:

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Inaugural Champions</strong></span>
<strong>Texas Rollergirls</strong> 24/2/2006 - 9/12/06
<strong>Tucson Roller Derby</strong> 9/12/06 - 18/2/07
<strong>Rat City Roller Girls</strong> 18/2/07 - 28/4/07
<strong>Windy City Rollers</strong> 28/4/07 - 19/8/07
<strong>Gotham Girls Roller Derby</strong> 19/8/07 - 29/9/07
<strong>Kansas City Roller Warriors</strong> 29/9/07 - 2/12/07
<strong>Carolina Rollergirls</strong> 2/12/07 - 19/7/08
<strong>Cincinnati Rollergirls</strong> 19/7/08 - 13/9/08
<strong>Detroit Derby Girls</strong> 13/9/08 - 11/10/08
<strong>Philly Roller Derby</strong> 11/10/08 - 11/10/08
<strong>Gotham Girls Roller Derby</strong> 11/10/08 - 14/11/09
<strong>Oly Rollers</strong> 14/11/09 - 3/10/10
<strong>Rocky Mountain Rollergirls</strong> 3/10/10 - 4/6/11
<strong>Oly Rollers</strong> 4/6/11 - 13/11/11
<strong>Gotham Girls Roller Derby</strong> 13/11/11 - ...

Here we have a decision to make. If we decide that the "Dust Devil Cup" is only eligible for WFTDA member leagues, then the chain ends with Gotham's first loss at a WFTDA Championships in many years, in 2015:

<strong>Gotham Girls Roller Derby</strong> 13/11/11 - 8/11/15
<strong>Rose City Rollers</strong> 8/11/15 - 30/4/16
<strong>Victorian Roller Derby League</strong> 30/4/16 - 5/11/16
<strong>Rose City Rollers</strong> 5/11/16 -
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Current Champions</strong></span>

If we embrace all of Roller Derby, however, we remember that Gotham had lost one time before then, in a battle of the Champions held in 2013. In this case, the chain goes:

<strong>Gotham Girls Roller Derby</strong> 13/11/11 - 6/6/13
<strong>Your Mom Men's Roller Derby</strong> 6/6/13 - 18/10/15
<strong>St Louis Gatekeepers</strong> 18/10/15 - 14/5/16
<strong>Team USA Men's Roller Derby</strong> 14/5/16 -
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Current Champions</strong></span>

but perhaps having the USA National <em>Men's</em> team in charge of the Cup is a little too controversial, even for a light amusement like this...

In both cases, however, there's an other interesting point to be made by this: even allowing any loss at all to count, Gotham's dominance over Roller Derby was genuinely astonishing, compared to the period before (where the Cup would have changed hands at least twice a year), and the new period after (where it has already changed hands twice in the past year). It's also a new period in that teams are actually losing outside of Champs - something which used to be not-unexpected occurrence, but now something which is again no longer quite as surprising.
