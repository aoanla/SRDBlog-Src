<html><body><p>So... Dundee's B Team, the Bonnie Colliders, have had a pretty exciting year to date, which is about to get only more exciting with their first appearance in tournament - Auld Reekie's <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/535844416618826/">ARRGmageddon</a></strong> on the weekend of the <strong>26th November</strong>.
We had a chat with Bonnie Colliders Co-Captains Khilleesi and G-Wrecks about the upcoming challenge - and also Dundee A's upcoming trip to Tenerife in December (as both skaters are also on the A roster).
