<html><body><p>As everyone slowly winds down for the Winter period break, some leagues are spending their final time on skates for good causes.

One such league is Glasgow Roller Derby, who are embracing the spirit of the period by holding their last public event of the year in support of two great charities: the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA) and "The Community and Beyond Toy Bank", a Glasgow based children's charity, which aims to provide support for children in poverty via gifts at Christmas.

In support of these charities, the event, <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1851294121772357/">"Don We our Skate Apparel"</a></strong>, will be taking no money for tickets - instead, a donation of one or more items for either charity is politely requested. (This can be tinned or dry food for animals, for example; or (new) children's toys, books or other entertainments in the other case).

Once in the event, your generosity will not just be repaid by knowing you've done a good thing, but also by the usual cake stall and raffle, mysterious "half time entertainment", a possible appearance by Santa Claus, and, of course, some fantastic roller derby featuring skaters from Glasgow and surrounding leagues!

So, help to make the season a little jollier for others, and come to the bout:

<strong>3rd December</strong>, from <strong>12:30</strong>, in GRD's usual venue The <strong><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/ARC:+Health+and+Fitness/@55.8662153,-4.2519289,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4888441f10416197:0x3a9426f40d4b58b7!8m2!3d55.8662153!4d-4.2497349">ARC</a></strong>, Glasgow Caledonian University.
