Tricks or treats? Why choose when you can have both – and a whole lot more – at Mean City’s closing home game of the year?

Glasgow’s only coed league will be hosting a devilish double dunt of derby delights on <strong>Saturday 29 October</strong> at the Dear Mean Place – aka the <strong>ARC Sportscentre in Glasgow</strong>.

Hallowe'en is when things go bump in the night - <strong>HallowMean</strong> is when things go bump on the track and there are trick and treats for everyone.

First up, the <strong>Mean City ladies</strong> – fresh from a gallus bout against Granite’s Fight Hawks and looking to maintain their forward momentum.

The Meanies have been reaping the benefits of a greater emphasis on tactics, fitness and skills – with fresh recruits bolstering the settled squad.

Their opponents on 29 October will be the out-of-this-world <strong>ASTROs (Auld Reekie All Star Rookies)</strong>. It’s going to be a stern test of the Mean City ladies’ resolve, as well as a showcase for some of Scotland’s finest up and coming skaters.

The second game will see <strong>Mean City's coed team</strong> ghosting to the track to take on <strong>Bairn City Rollers' Belter Skelpers</strong>.

Tis the season to be fearful and while there’s no fear among the Mean City ranks, there will be some trepidation given the excellent form the Belter Skelpers have been in.

Bairn City Rollers’ coed team recently played a mix of Aberdeen and Dundee skaters – the Brawler Buddies – and really brought their A game, winning with a well-oiled performance combining offence, defence and excellent tactics.

Mean City’s coed team may lack the experience of their opponents, but they have spirit, guts and tenacity in abundance and will match them skate for skate.

Mean City President Elaine Hunter – aka Roller Dobby - said: “We can’t wait to round off our home season in style with a spook-tacular thriller for all the family.

“Trick or treat – why choose when you can have both? There will be skating, fun, cakes and cracking tunes – what else are Saturdays made for?

“Tickets are just <b>£4</b> in advance – that’s just £2 per game – or <b>£5</b> on the door. It’s a bargain and you’ll be supporting grassroots sport at the same time. Under-14s get in free.”
