<html><body><p>Dublin Roller Derby have been a <em>very</em> busy league this year - earlier on, as we <strong><a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/04/01/europe-goes-to-beach-brawl/">reported</a></strong>, they joined Auld Reekie and Newcastle at Gold Coast's Beach Brawl in Florida. Last weekend, they went across to play Middlesbrough Milk Rollers and Hot Wheel Roller Derby [<strong><a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/21/european-roller-derby-22-october-update/">as we reported in our roundup</a></strong>]. This weekend (as we will be reporting), they're hosting a triple-header for their B-team.

And on <strong>November</strong> the <strong>5th</strong>, they're <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/299480537069476/">hosting</a></strong> again, as Glasgow Roller Derby travel across to Ireland to take them on.

Glasgow have had a difficult year, and Dublin Roller Derby are flush with increased confidence after their performance in the US: <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com">Flat Track Stats</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/85892/rankings">predicts</a></strong> a 90% win probability for the home team. <strong><a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/10/08/ranking-the-world-and-other-fts-visualisations/2">SRD Rank</a></strong> (using the 1 October rankings*) agrees, and also concurs with FTS's approximate prediction that Dublin should score about 70 to 75% of the total points. That said, Glasgow's Irn Bruisers have been working hard to rebuild, and they may still surprise us.

Doors open at <strong>12pm</strong> for 1pm start. Hosted at Dublin Roller Derby's usual venue, <strong><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Shoreline+Leisure+Greystones/@53.136466,-6.067257,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4867af24e2419651:0x45f0195e8da6d900!8m2!3d53.136466!4d-6.065063">Shoreline Leisure Greystones</a></strong>, Dublin.

Tickets: <strong>€7</strong> (under 16's free, accompanied) on the door.
