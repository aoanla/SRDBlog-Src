<html><body><p>Down south, <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamenglandrollerderby/">Team England</a></strong> have been hard at work with a massive set of tryouts over the last 2 months. After two initial tryouts in August, one in the North of England (hosted by Rainy City Roller Derby, the highest WFTDA ranked league north of London), and one in the South (hosted by London Rollergirls themselves), the initial talented few still had to face the final second-round tryout session in Birmingham, hosted by Central City Rollergirls. UKRDA Observers were, of course, present at each tryout to ensure fairness.

New Team England Manager illbilly, along with multiple selection teams chosen for their expertise in the Regions have deliberated and come to their final conclusions for the Training Roster.

As expected, the roster draws strongly from the highest ranked UKRDA member teams: London Rollergirls provide 14 members, and Rainy City Roller Derby an impressive 7, with Middlesbrough Milk Rollers, Newcastle Roller Girls, Bristol Roller Derby, Liverpool Roller Birds, London Rockin' Rollers, Central City Rollergirls, and (across from the 'States) Charm City Roller Girls all helping to fill out the roster.

Official England Photographer Jason Ruffell captured images of the tryouts <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamenglandrollerderby/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1117984021615161">here</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamenglandrollerderby/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1161561447257418">here</a></strong>.
