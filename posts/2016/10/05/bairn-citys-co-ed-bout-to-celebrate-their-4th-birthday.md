<html><body><p>Bairn City Rollers became Scotland's first co-ed league back in 2012. Now as they approach their 4th birthday they are kicking of celebrations and ending their 2016 season in the best way they could, a co-ed game. Their opponents will be the Brawler Buddies, who are made up of skaters from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/granitecitybrawlers/">Granite City Brawlers</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GraniteCityRollerDerby/">Granite City Roller Derby</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dundeerollergirls/">Dundee Roller Girls</a>.

In change from the norm, there will be no advanced ticket sales for this event. Instead in celebration of their 4th birthday BCR are inviting spectators to pay what they want on the day. That's right, <span class="_4n-j fsl">just turn up on the game and pay whatever you like.</span>

The game will take place at Grangemouth Sports Complex on Saturday the 15th of October, doors will be open from 2.15pm and first whistle will be at 2.40pm, for more information <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/527945357409228/">visit the event page here</a>
