<html><body><h3><strong>Dundee Roller Girls</strong> are shaking up their three year old home teams season with a round robin style tournament on the<strong> 5<sup>th</sup> of November.</strong></h3>
Showcasing the skating talent from their brand new intake as well as the old veterans and favourites from the Silvery Tayzers and the Bonnie Colliders. We see three teams, <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Jutesofhazzard/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Jutes of Hazzard</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jammindodgers/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Jammin' Dodgers</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Press-Gangsters-246335275570905/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Press Gangsters </a></em>battle it out to be crowned the tournament winner!  Each team representing aspects of Dundee life and history often summed up as jam, jute and journalism.
