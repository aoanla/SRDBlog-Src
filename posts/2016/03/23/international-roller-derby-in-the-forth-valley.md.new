<html><body><p>On Saturday 9th of April, Fierce Valley Roller Girls will host their first home game of the year, and against international opposition in the shape of Zurich City Rollergirlz. The game will be the second in a double header, and marks just the second time that FVRG have faced an international league, after taking on Oslo Roller Derby back in October 2013.
Formed in 2009, Zurich City Rollergirlz was Switzerland’s first roller derby league and became a full WFTDA member league towards the end of 2015. Currently ranked at 95 in Europe by Flat Track Stats while FVRG sits at 127, this promises to be a close and hard fought game.

The leagues represented include Ayrshire Roller Derby, Auld Reekie Roller Girls, Bairn City Rollers, Doonhame Derby Dolls, Dundee Roller Girls, Glasgow Roller Derby, Granite City Roller Girls, Inverness City Roller Derby, Lothian Derby Dolls and New Town Roller Girls.
