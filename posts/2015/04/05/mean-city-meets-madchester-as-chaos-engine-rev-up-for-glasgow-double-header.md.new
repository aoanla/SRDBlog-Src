Glasgow’s own Mean City Roller Derby will welcome Manchester Roller Derby’s Chaos Engine to the town for a showdown soundtracked by everyone from Oasis and The Stone Roses to New Order and The Smiths.

Will Mean City be feeling ‘Supersonic’ with their ‘Wonderwalls’ or will the Chaos Engine skaters be ‘Made of Stone’? We’ll find out on Saturday April 25 at the ARC sportscentre.

It’s a very special occasion as Mean City will be joining forces with friends Glasgow Roller Derby to host a double-header.

Also on the bill will be Glasgow Roller Derby’s Cannie Gingers who will be playing Team Metal Legs – a select squad made up of skaters who have suffered and subsequently overcome breaks during the derby career.

That means fans will be treated to two full games for the price of one – an all-male game and an all-female game – showcasing some of the silkiest skills and high-octane thrills that this wonderful sport has to offer.

Alan Muir, Chair of Mean City Roller Derby, said: “I hope as many people as possible come along to the ARC on April 25 – it’s a great opportunity to get to know this wonderful sport, enjoy some groovy tunes and meet some of Scotland’s friendliest skaters.

“There’s no ‘Definitely Maybe’ about it – April 25 is going to be a fantastic celebration of spills, thrills and derby-aches.

“Get your ticket now – we’ll sell you a full seat, but you’ll be perched on the edge of it when these four teams take to the track.”

Alan added: “We can’t wait to welcome Manchester Roller Derby’s Chaos Engine to town – they are great league and a fantastic group of people.

“And we’re delighted to be hosting a double-header as our good friends at Glasgow Roller Derby take on the magnificent Team Metal Legs.

“Come along with all the family – there will be refreshments, merchandise and more on the day too. To quote The Stone Roses - it's ‘What the World is Waiting For’!”
