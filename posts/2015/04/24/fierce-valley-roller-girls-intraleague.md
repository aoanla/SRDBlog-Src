Since the venue is rather 'intimate', it is recommended to buy your tickets in advance to avoid disappointment. Tickets are priced at £5 in advance/£7 on the door, and kids under 14 go free with a paying adult.

Doors will open at 2pm. As always, there will be a selection of handmade crafts, home-baking and team merchandise for sale.
