<html><body><p>According to our calculations, yesterday marked 4 years of this blog.

Since last year, we've covered more new leagues, increased our coverage of the growing <a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/tag/mens-roller-derby/">men's derby</a>Â and <a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/tag/junior-roller-derby/">junior derby</a> community in Scotland, covered another <a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/category/roller-derby-world-cup-2014/">World Cup</a> (including interviews with all participating teams), started some analysis of <a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/tag/analysis/">roller derby stats</a>, moved into some coverage of exciting Roller Derby development across the <a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/tag/Future-Derby/">World</a>, covered <a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/tag/UKRDA/">UKRDA</a>'s bigger actions, and saluted the end of <a href="https://scottishrollerderbyblog.com/tag/DNN/">DNN</a>. We also finally reached 1000 likes on our Facebook page!

Obviously, we're most proud of the last item, but it's been an exciting year for all these reasons, and we hope to make it to many more. If you'd like us to increase our coverage of anything in particular, do comment on this post and we'll see what we can do...</p></body></html>
