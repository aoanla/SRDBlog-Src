As such, it's no surprise that <a href="http://www.glasgowrollerderby.com">Glasgow Roller Derby</a> are continuing their tradition of a Hallowe'en bout with a fancy-dress competition as part of their Saturday double-header. The sporting component will also be exciting, with <a href="http://tampererollerderby.com/en/">Tampere Roller Derby</a> travelling across from Finland to face Glasgow's Maiden Grrders, and <a href="http://lothianderbydolls.com/">Lothian Derby Dolls</a> taking on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NewTownRollerGirls">New Town Roller Girls</a> in the opener.

The event starts at 12:30pm Saturday, at the ARC Sports Centre, Glasgow Caledonian University.
