This is the Sunday addendum for this week's highlights; and it's a pretty busy Sunday, taking into account the several "whole weekend" events in our Saturday main highlight update.

As well as Sunday, we have one event for next *Wednesday*, in St Petersburg. Wednesday is a difficult date for our highlights, as Monday isn't really enough notice, so we're including it here for safe keeping.

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention.

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).
