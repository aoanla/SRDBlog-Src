The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`Railtown Loco Rollers`_ host a triple-header, the last fixture in British Champs Tier 3 West (WFTDA-side). With Severn Roller Torrent already safely at the top of the league table, and playing lowest-placed Stoke, , the real excitement is in the final game: 2nd and 3rd placed Wolverhampton and Railtown vying for that #2 spot which guarantees promotion into Tier 2. With no relegation in Tier 3, #5 Coventry will be looking to push #4 Bridgend down into their old spot, for honour, rather than anything else.

- Severn Roller Torrent (Gloucestershire) versus Stoke City Rollers
- Bridgend Roller Derby versus Coventry Roller Derby
- Wolverhampton Honour Rollers versus Railtown Loco Rollers (Crewe)
