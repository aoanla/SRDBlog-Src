This is the Sunday addendum to our weekly highlights, giving events on the 8th a bit of space to breathe!

A lot of our Sunday highlights this time are festive open scrimmages, in Australia, New Zealand, Wales, and England. But in Argentina there's a 1 day tournament using Short Track Roller Derby rules; in France a rookies bootcamp and a triple header, and in Mexico, a single bout to close the season.


The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`Chat Noir Roller Derby`_ are celebrating their Seventh? birthday with a whole-day tournament against teams from across the province of Buenos Aires. More excitingly, this will entirely be run with the `Rolla Skate Club`_ Short Track Roller Derby ruleset, which is really helping the sustainability of Roller Derby in Argentina, with its reduced requirements in space, time, rostering and officiating load!

There will also be some kind of mixed scrimmage after the main tournament, as far as we can tell.

Attendees are also promised cake & Piñata!
