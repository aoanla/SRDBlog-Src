As we approach the end of the year, there's an increasing density of festive tournaments, so once again, this weekend is so busy that we'll need a follow-up event just for the Sunday fixtures.

This Saturday and whole-weekend, though, we have a host of highlights, including Nottingham's 10th anniversary, a whole-weekend bootcamp with ShortStop in Thailand, and a quadruple header in the south of France with Roller Derby Toulouse.

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`ORDA`_ (Oficiales Roller Derby Argentina) host another edition of Un Sol para lxs Oficalxs; the mini tournament series which raises funds for Argentina's officials to travel to support tournaments in the country.

This event is a triangular (3 team round robin) MRDA-gender event, which is also a rare thing for Argentina, although none of the teams have been announced at the time of going to press. (This was previously announced as a quadrangular, but the final team proved impossible to commit.)
