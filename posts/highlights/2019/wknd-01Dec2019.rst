This is the Sunday addendum to our weekly highlights, giving events on the 1st a bit of space to breathe!

As well as action in Colombia as part of the 10th anniversary of Roller Derby in the country, there's also a bunch of open scrims in Australia and the UK, a triple header in France, action in Mexico and Argentina... and more chances to try Short Track Roller Derby in Worcester, UK.

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

Players will retain their teams for the following two parts of the series, to allow a better feel for their progress.
