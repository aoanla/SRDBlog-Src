This weekend's biggest events are in Mexico, the USA and the UK: Mexico City hosts the second Division 1 Playoffs for the Mexican National tournament, determining who will join Playoff 1 qualifiers Baja Roller Derby, All-Star Juarez and Discordias in the Championships; Sailor City Rollers represent Latin America in the second North American WFTDA Continental Cup this post season; and Riot City Rollers host the first ever Chartist Cup in Wales. Meanwhile, in Scotland, we're raising money to fight cancer with the return of Charity Roller Derby Sevens tournament, Krustfest, for a second year.

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).
