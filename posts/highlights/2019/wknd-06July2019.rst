This weekend's highlights are back to our two update format.

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

There's not one, but two national championships decided this weekend, as the finals of the Finnish National Championships and the first ever ARDE Spanish National Championships both fall here.

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`Manchester Roller Derby`_ host the final fixture in the British Championships Tier 1 North! With the top sport already taken by Liverpool Roller Birds, it's a battle for second place, and against relegation here. Sheffield Steel, in the bottom spot, cannot avoid relegation in their game against Auld Reekie - but Auld Reekie will need to win impressively to stand a chance of taking the second playoffs place to play for the Championship. That's also only possible if Manchester's Checkerbroads, currently in that second playoffs spot, find neighbours Rainy Revolution too much to handle - a situation which is also the Oldham team's only way out of that second relegation spot!

.. _Manchester Roller Derby: http://www.manchesterrollerderby.com

- Checkerbroads (Manchester A) versus Rainy City Revolution (Rainy City B \| Oldham)
- Sheffield Steel Roller Derby versus Auld Reekie Reserves (Auld Reekie B \| Edinburgh)

Event starts: 1200 Saturday (doors open)
