This is another exceptionally busy weekend - once again, as we come to the end of the year, each weekend has multiple National Tournaments in it. In this case, the 2019 Mexican National Championships are in Querétaro, and the Brasilian Nationals are in Blumenau. (Plus, of course, this is the weekend of WFTDA's Championships). In addition, the ongoing Finnish and French tournament fixtures recur again this weekend...

... and there are big tournaments in Kiel, Regensburg, Cambridge, Wiltshire, and Buenos Aires!

[We'd also like to shout out the bout in Japan, for Yokosuka Sushi Rollers versus Kamikaze Badass, and also Tel Aviv Roller Derby's open scrim!]

This is busy enough that we're going to have a second, short, Sunday-only update later in the week so we can fit more geographical range in here.

(Plus, more that we've not got space to summarise up here, and you'll have to read down for!)

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`Rock City Roller Derby`_ host the `Asociación Mexicana de Roller Derby`_ National Tournament Championships for this year, with both the MRDA-gender and WFTDA-gender Division 1 Champions decided over 3 days. Both tiers play a single-elimination tournament with 6 teams; losers of the first two games play for 5th in addition.

We wrote an intro to this season of the tournament `here`__ . Since then, our predictions have been fairly accurate: Baja Roller Derby have performed a bit better than expected, thanks to their WFTDA Sanctioned games across the border in the USA, but the top of the field is still very much up for contest.

This event will be livestreamed [by Derby Wife], and covered live by Hit Squad TV.

`Montreal Roller Derby`_ host the `WFTDA Championships`_ , of interest to us due to the participation of **Victorian Roller Derby League**, representing Australia, and **2x4 Roller Derby**, representing Argentina for the first time. We believe that this is the first time since 2012 that no European teams have been in the WFTDA Championships - but it's also a great moment for Latin America, who are represented for the first time.

As always, WFTDA Champs is a single-elimination tournament with consolation games.

Also important at this event is the hosted Exhibition Game: `"WE ARE NATION"`_ , featuring two borderless nations, **Jewish Roller Derby (רולר דרבי יהודי)** and **Team Indigenous Roller Derby** playing to support the cause of borderless nations and marginalized groups across the world. This will be one of the free games streamed on WFTDA.TV.
