This is the Sunday addendum to this weekend's highlights, covering events from Sunday through Tuesday next. There's a *lot* of end-of-year scrimmages up in Scotland, Finland and other places, of various kinds - but we'd like to shout out one particular event:

Raptors Derby Moscow, only the second Roller Derby league in Russia, are making history this Sunday by holding the first ever public Bout in Moscow! This was only possible due to crowdfunding to support their guest coach flying over from Portsmouth to run the attached bootcamp, and with support from St Petersburg Roller Derby, who have been tireless supporters and promoters of Derby in Russia and nearby countries.

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

`Helsinki Coast Quads`_ had such a good time with their "Big Track Roller Derby" season ender last year, that they're doing it all again this year. As with last year, this is a fun, "Xmas rules" variant scrimmage, using the over-sized track that was mistakenly provided for them due to misread specifications last year.

Open to All genders of skaters, mins-passed.

`Castres Roller Derby`_ are doing the opposite of most of us, and hosting a bootcamp as we approach the festive season. This 1 day skater bootcamp is coached by Mac Rocket (Nothing Toulouse) and Why So Sirus (Montreal Roller Derby).
We believe that this bootcamp is open to skates of All genders, and it will end with a Scrimmage as is normal for these events.
