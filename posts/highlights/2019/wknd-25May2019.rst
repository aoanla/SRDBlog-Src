There are far too many valuable fixtures to cover all of them (especially in France and the UK, which tend to
have multiple tournaments, bootcamps etc all on one weekend), but we also don't want to be so strict as to have
just 1 per country. So, we'll be doing the following:

Two highlights a weekend - Sat + (All Weekend); and then a smaller one for Sunday.

Both highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc.

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).
