This is the Sunday addendum to this weekend's highlights, with even more roller derby of all kinds.

Remember: if you want to ensure your event has a chance of being highlighted, you can contact us via Facebook, Instagram, Email or WeChat to remind us. (If your website has a useful RSS or other syndication feed, please tell us about it, too.) We highlight events for various reasons, not just because they "big", so don't be shy.

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

Sun: Lanús, Argentina

`Atomic Bombs Roller Derby`_ host a double header of Roller Derby, as they take on a joint, mixed team from Colmena Roller Derby and Cerberos Roller Derby (of Remedios de Escalada), who are punning a little with their mixed team name, followed by a mixed gender bout with Inka Roller Derby playing an open subscription team (Chambelanes). [As far as we can tell, the entire theme of this double header is a gentle mocking of the "Sweet sixteen"/"debutante ball" event.]
